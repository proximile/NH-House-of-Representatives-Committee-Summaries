i will not take any questions at this
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
time we can make discussions during
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
it has been a long-standing practice
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
within the public works
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%

every biennium
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
but he also then becomes a member of the
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee able to
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%

district 24 the towns of rye and
 
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.070 align:start position:0%
district 24 the towns of rye and
newcastle

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
newcastle
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
um first i would like to clarify i don't
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to the bill
 
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to the bill
um

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't know quite how to state my
 
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.389 align:start position:0%
i didn't know quite how to state my
position

00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
because i would look like right now the
 
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.030 align:start position:0%
because i would look like right now the
um

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
the the coastal flooding model as
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
proposed by des is not in the bill
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm my testimony um
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
well i sent a letter
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
to you i hope that you received it
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
which uh clarified the importance of
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
that model to the seacoast
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
and i just want to stress that
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
because this is a dynamic model
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
how restrictions like bridges and canals
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
and sg not estuaries would affect
 
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.509 align:start position:0%
and sg not estuaries would affect
the

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
flooding on the seacoast during a
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
a weather situation
 
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to know that
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
the seacoast would not be affected
 
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.910 align:start position:0%
the seacoast would not be affected
uniformly

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
uniformly
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
but some areas of the seacoast would be
 
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.430 align:start position:0%
but some areas of the seacoast would be
affected

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
at a greater
 
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.829 align:start position:0%
at a greater
significance

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
significance
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
so it allows us to look at the seacoast
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
as a whole rather than a piecemeal
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
effort which would also help
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
if we needed to
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
design when we need to design roads and
 
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.509 align:start position:0%
design when we need to design roads and
um

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it could it's it
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
allows for us to do that and maintain
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
a sustainable
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
natural resource that is not only a home
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
for our residents
 
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.269 align:start position:0%
for our residents
and

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
their livelihood is also an important
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
tourist destination for the for the
 
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
tourist destination for the for the
state

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%

i have no other hands raised the only
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
other person who indicated that they
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.829 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not on
 
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.310 align:start position:0%
it's not on
um

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%

um
so

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
we will wait about five minutes just
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
because this is a zoom platform people
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
may be having a moment to hook up
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
um i would hate to cut anybody off by
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
646 of general funds remaining
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
we found two items that are missing
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh we need to extend the appropriation
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
that started in 2013
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
for unspecified minor military
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
construction for the edges in general
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
and also for the engine general we need
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
to extend the appropriations that began
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
the presentations we learned that two
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
agencies were requesting that their
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
funds be repurposed
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
requested a repurpose of 161 890 through
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
the coastal flooding monitoring modeling
 
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.230 align:start position:0%
the coastal flooding monitoring modeling
projects

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
and they supply
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
proposed language i don't believe we'll
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
actually need to use that
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
requested a repurpose of seventy four
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to fire academy hvac
 
00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:21.909 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to fire academy hvac
upgrade

00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
now it's important to note these are
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
fire academy funds
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh the fire apparatus is ordered so we
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
know the cost of it has not yet been
 
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.470 align:start position:0%
know the cost of it has not yet been
delivered

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh they had another project to do the
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
hvac upgrade that was short of funds
 
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.310 align:start position:0%
hvac upgrade that was short of funds
because

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
the bid came in above what the amount
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh if we were to do this uh it would
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
enable us to get the fire truck
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
which is on order and it would also
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
enable them to have enough money
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
in fire funds
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
to do the hvac project
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
the lba recommends amending the original
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate leading the last extension
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
for these funds and amending the purpose
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
which would be in hospital 25
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
of 2019 uh
 
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:12.870 align:start position:0%
of 2019 uh
section

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
romans 15
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
and b to read fire academy new truck and
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
hbac upgrade
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
for one million two hundred thousand
 
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
for one million two hundred thousand
dollars

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
i will know
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
i want
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
since these are fire funds and and uh it
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
enables them to finish the project
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh this is my personal opinion i will
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
recommend that the committee adopt this
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
and include that language in house bill
 
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.269 align:start position:0%
and include that language in house bill
25

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh the next item would be that we
 
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.950 align:start position:0%
uh the next item would be that we
located

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
located
 
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.909 align:start position:0%
located
2.233

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
2.233
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
million 117 dollars
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
in general fund appropriations from
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
completed projects
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
that are available for re-purpose and i
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
won't go through all the all the
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
agencies that's in the written report
 
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.070 align:start position:0%
agencies that's in the written report
uh

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
the biggest item is the department of
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
at 1.7 million
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
and uh when it comes time the committee
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
amendment will
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
repurpose these funds to other uses
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
you could look in prior capital budgets
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
to see how that's done we did find one
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
error in one of the agency presentations
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh but that's the material to hospital
 
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.669 align:start position:0%
uh but that's the material to hospital
25.

00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%

from federal fund appropriations that
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
can be repurposed for other projects as
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
we go forward to this budget
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct the let's uh chris from
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
produced those numbers and i went
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
through and manually reconfirmed
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
from the information that was supplied
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
by the agencies that those those figures
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
are correct
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
thank you and i agree with them
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
last friday i know that is
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
time-consuming exhaustive
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
to trying to pin down all the agencies
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
on what they do with
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
prior appropriations but it is a useful
 
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
prior appropriations but it is a useful
exercise

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
having done it myself and i do
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%

see no questions of representative jack
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
i would ex
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
accept the motion that the report of the

on the committee

um this is not a new procedure we have
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
done this several times in the past but
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
at this point we're usually just taking
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
a voice vote on accepting that the
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee report but because of
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
the nature of our meetings now
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
anything like that as i said in the
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
done on a roll call

with that we have
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:03.670 align:start position:0%
some time
uh

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
my intention today
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
is to go through agency by agency
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the compare report
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
prepared by the lba
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
we started using this on our last work
 
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.270 align:start position:0%
we started using this on our last work
session

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.390 align:start position:0%
session
and

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
we will begin
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
and go through them all
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
after we have heard
 
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
after we have heard
from

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
the agencies if there are any changes we
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
can go back to
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
them back to uh each a
 
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.829 align:start position:0%
them back to uh each a
section

00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
but if we don't start moving forward
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get an amendment done
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:26.950 align:start position:0%
you if you'd like
[Music]

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
so you should be able to see it and what
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
they've provided for you is with the
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation what they've spent the
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
money on
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
the various projects so
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget for 2021 the
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
current um budget that we're in there
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
was an appropriation of 1.5 million
 
00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:43.349 align:start position:0%
was an appropriation of 1.5 million
dollars

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
of which they've spent 819 on the six
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
projects listed
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a balance remaining of six
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty thousand dollars
 
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.710 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty thousand dollars
they've

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
they've
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
completely spent the amount that was
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
carried forward from the 1819 budget
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
that was 500 000
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that went towards the concord steam
 
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:04.309 align:start position:0%
and that went towards the concord steam
conversion

00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
so that that's the information they
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
provided on the emergency fund that they
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you so
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
much for bringing that up on the screen
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
so it would appear that um
 
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.069 align:start position:0%
so it would appear that um
[Music]

00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
steam project is complete
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh and that there's a balance of 819.
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman would it be appropriate to
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
speak of reducing
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million to
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate and the committee can
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
do whatever we want with the numbers
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the governor have provided
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that if
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
when we do things like that
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the fact that uh the state
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
is self-insured
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i would like to see that there's a
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
healthy balance there
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
and i i'm suggesting that we reduce the
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
1.5 million
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
by 500 000 so that we might possibly
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of some critical uh roofs
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh and it would appear that it would
 
00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:46.230 align:start position:0%
uh and it would appear that it would
leave

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
leave
1.819

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
in that fund
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
so i know if i need to do that as a
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
motion or for conversation
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
conversation at the moment thank you sir
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
680 left the way i'm reading this
 
00:46:01.599 --> 00:46:03.510 align:start position:0%
680 left the way i'm reading this
um

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
oh i i apologize 680. sorry mr chair the
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
other one that's been fully spent yeah
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm reading that right
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
you are um so there's 680 000 remaining
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
from the appropriation made in 2021 for
 
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.589 align:start position:0%
from the appropriation made in 2021 for
fun

00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
fun
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
it would still leave them once thanks to
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i would make a
 
00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.710 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i i would make a
motion

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh to reduce line 23 statewide emergency
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
fund from the governor's proposal of 1.5
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
until we have the completed amendment
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
but we have
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the past and we will continue to do
 
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
in the past and we will continue to do
it

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.630 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
so our votes on each agency as we're
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
going forward and line items that we may
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
again normally we could do this with the
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
weight slope however
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments representative
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is just a straw vote if we
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
did this we could revisit this right we
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think i'd be willing to do it for now
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
but i want to see what else you know
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
because i know we got a lot of projects
 
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.589 align:start position:0%
because i know we got a lot of projects
so

00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
but if we you know and i don't know how
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
the rest of the metric i was coming to
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
so i think i will support it for now but
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
i couldn't
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
deserve the right to maybe change my
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i just want to
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
clarify so the emergency fund really is
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
the emergency fund and it's a backup
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
fund so if they're are calamities they
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
they can immediately have access to
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
monies to repair them
 
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.549 align:start position:0%
monies to repair them
but

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we uh self-insured we
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
but there have been times in the past
 
00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.549 align:start position:0%
but there have been times in the past
where

00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
severe damage due to a storm that we
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
hadn't spent money quickly to
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why we continue to put this
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
kind of money into
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
an emergency fund
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
and we continue it from miami to miami
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
just so that we can but
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
it is for emergency
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
and if we need to do it use it for
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
something else they have to come before
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative either
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
standing or statutory committees to do
 
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.270 align:start position:0%
standing or statutory committees to do
that

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh i plan to support this
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
at this point um but i would guess that
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
das had some of the problems other
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
agencies have had in expending funds
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
as needed because of covid so
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you very much
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on this motion to
 
00:50:01.359 --> 00:50:02.390 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on this motion to
reduce

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh statewide emergency fund
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
point five million to one million
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
dollars mr chairman
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
so as i understand that that's going to
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
add the 680 000 to the million
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
we're actually increasing the amount
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
they want
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
well oh all right so
 
00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:29.109 align:start position:0%
well oh all right so
because

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
if you extend the laps of 680
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
and give them 1.5 then they have 2 over
 
00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:38.309 align:start position:0%
and give them 1.5 then they have 2 over
2

00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:53.750 align:start position:0%
it depends
to on what calamity

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
to on what calamity
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
state buildings
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
and one year there was a building
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
collapse that we had to shore up walls
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
and stuff which was a warehouse
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
it was useful we did it done quickly
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
and they do

00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
is my memory wrong did we not ask
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
someone in one of the
 
00:51:20.839 --> 00:51:22.710 align:start position:0%
someone in one of the
um

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
department hearings to look at the
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
the cost of having that million dollar
 
00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:28.950 align:start position:0%
the cost of having that million dollar
deductible

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
what the difference was i don't remember
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
which agency it was but i know we asked
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
someone to come back to us and tell us
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
why it was
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
a million dollar deductible and what's
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the cost the insurance would be to
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
drop that
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'll try to remember the answer and i
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't think we got
 
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.109 align:start position:0%
don't think we got
clarification

00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't at the time
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes we did ask the question
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
and someone was reporting back and i
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
apologize i can't tell you yeah i can't
 
00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.109 align:start position:0%
apologize i can't tell you yeah i can't

00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't there looking back at the 2019
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
originally as i under read it this is
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
called the lba information the governor
 
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.710 align:start position:0%
called the lba information the governor
requested

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.589 align:start position:0%
requested
2

00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
2 million 250 000 we cut it in the house
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
to 1.5 million and the senate went along
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
with it and they've got extra money so
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to support this at least for
 
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:22.950 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to support this at least for
now

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
based on past experience and hopefully
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
the past experience will
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
continue in this lecture
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
so that's one reason why i'm willing to
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education had 132

491 dollars
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh that from prior appropriations that
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
was about collapse
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
i would accept the motion that that
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
and if that were to be approved the new
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
additional funding would be 467
 
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
additional funding would be 467
509

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'll second it
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
just so i'm clear representing graham
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
you you want to split this a new
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation between
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
um a new appropriation in house bill 25
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
and repurposing
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
an amount of existing
 
01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
an amount of existing
appropriation

01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
and then repurposed
 
01:13:59.199 --> 01:14:00.709 align:start position:0%
and then repurposed
132

01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
132
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and change that they had from
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you can do it um it may cause some
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
confusion when people are trying to kind
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
of keep track of the project because
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
you'll have an appropriation in two
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
different places
 
01:14:20.159 --> 01:14:22.470 align:start position:0%
different places
um

01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
why only a piece of what's remaining of
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
the repurposing amount and not the
 
01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.390 align:start position:0%
the repurposing amount and not the
entire

01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
which

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
where are you looking
 
01:14:39.679 --> 01:14:40.550 align:start position:0%
where are you looking
well

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
just to make sure i guess i'm trying to
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
make sure i have everything so the
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
department of correction projects both
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
of those were those repurposed funds the
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
200 and the 300
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
directions there is only 60
 
01:14:52.960 --> 01:15:02.229 align:start position:0%
directions there is only 60
655

01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
just just for clarity when you don't
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
need to um align with an agency's
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
lapsing to a new project you can use the
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
whatever is you want to repurpose for a
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
the agency may be lapsing from an
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
existing project
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
um so i i
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
thought the department of corrections
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
you had voted to
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
um fund
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
both the new projects from the
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
repurposing dollars i guess i might have
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
missed that
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
i think we did it only for once it was
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
such a small amount we did the actual
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
vote mr was first
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
to repurpose the uh
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
department of corrections center lapse
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
for 16
 
01:15:46.159 --> 01:16:03.189 align:start position:0%
for 16
655

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay i didn't catch all that you were

breaking up representative mills
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
but that's all that's okay at the end of
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
this um maybe through a phone call or an

said that they could use for this
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
project that they could
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
do with that amount
 
01:20:12.239 --> 01:20:13.270 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.270 align:start position:0%
um
unless

01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:15.990 align:start position:0%

i

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
are you willing to go to that amount or
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
i i just rounded their 100 and i thought
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
161 up to 100 because it was 161 ate
 
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
161 up to 100 because it was 161 ate
some

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
i just said 162. so
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
rodney that you started adding to the
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh we can go with exactly what they say
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they are uh
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
lapsing which
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay which is 161 890
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes i'll make that yes let's use that
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
figure then sir that's what you'd like
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
so the motion would be to repurpose
 
01:20:56.159 --> 01:20:58.070 align:start position:0%
so the motion would be to repurpose
um

01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
past senator rasales this morning
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
i want to be supportive of
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative edgar at this point
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote in favor i believe
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not totally uh sold on this project
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
i'm most likely when we're done look at
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
a lesser number so that we can get this
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
project started but at this point i will
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
any other comments on this or questions
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
thompson um
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
having been
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
a coastal contractor for the last
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
20 years and
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
mean tides rise almost 19 inches in the
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
whatever money we spend in this study
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh is money well spent
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
i know there was a governor's commission
 
01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.709 align:start position:0%
i know there was a governor's commission
report

01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
done a number of years ago by the new
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
england governors
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
i've read that report and it recommended
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
that all states raise their sea walls
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
feed immediately
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with the global warming and
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
the effects we're going to have from
 
01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
the effects we're going to have from
that

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i've i've seen the flooding in the
 
01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.149 align:start position:0%
and i've i've seen the flooding in the
hampton

01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
hampton
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
and rye areas on a
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
almost weekly basis some summer
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i think there certainly needs to be
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
some money put into this to figure out
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
how to
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
do you think that there lacks money to
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
continue on with this and which does not
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
add to our bottom line of generally
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
funded projects
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bottom line to where we are
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
any of these line items can be
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
represented but for now call of all
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
please thank you for repurpose
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%

mr chairman
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
wilkins building is part of this
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
there was a cost of a
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
proposal to demolish
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
a failing building
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to propose that we had i
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
believe the number is 750 000 dollars uh
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the bottom line for the demolition of
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
that building
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
have a second name
 
01:27:51.679 --> 01:27:52.709 align:start position:0%
have a second name
okay

01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
that building has fired and it's
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
currently unusable
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
a security fence around it but it is a
 
01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
a security fence around it but it is a
uh

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
chasm shall we say to
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
we are going to need to do something
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
about that state building in the middle
 
01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.430 align:start position:0%
about that state building in the middle
of

01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
the queen city
 
01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.110 align:start position:0%
the queen city
is

01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
as i said a nuisance i'm not
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
we can ask when they they come this
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
afternoon what what their plans are but
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
at this point uh
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
any questions about appropriating
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
750 000
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
01:28:49.440 --> 01:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
to remove
um

01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
and was it something that that the
 
01:29:05.679 --> 01:29:06.709 align:start position:0%
and was it something that that the
department

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
didn't get in the governor's budget
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
right that is correct all right i just
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
can't seem to find it
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
it it is um
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
under hhs
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's towards the end it's one of
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
their quality priorities
 
01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:32.690 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:33.830 align:start position:0%

01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i i do plan to support
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
this mr chairman but i'm very interested
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
to hear what hhs has to say about the
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
sununu center and what their overall
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
plan is because
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
buildings that are deteriorating are
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
external to the main center and
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
it just will be good to find out what
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
they have in mind for those things as we
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
sort of put our precious dollars out
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
there thank you
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
no matter what representative people
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
even if we were
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
by some stretch of the imagination to
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
close that center
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
we still have the responsibility to
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
to take care of the uh
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think you're right mr chair
 
01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
i think you're right mr chair
uh

01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
the motion is to add
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
the demolition of the wilkins building
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
under hhs
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%

hhs will be here this afternoon
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
we can ask more about that
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
but moving on
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
for the moment
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
let's see that and the appropriation
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
of new generally funded
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh monies would be zero
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
you need a second mr chair
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
i think i heard what
 
01:34:04.719 --> 01:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
i think i heard what
okay

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
this is wrong
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
details as for clarification what are we
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
the boy
 
01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.629 align:start position:0%
the boy
and

01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think it was their number one uh
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded priority in their presentation
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it is a zero-sum game in lots of
 
01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:43.350 align:start position:0%
and it is a zero-sum game in lots of
ways

01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
we can try but if you will look at um
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
what uh representative mcconkey is is
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting we use to pay for this
 
01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.430 align:start position:0%
suggesting we use to pay for this
collapses

01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
so it's a little over
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand just in case that
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
that estimate is not correct
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh i would if it cost more than that
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
they'll have to come back to us
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%

ip projects
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
they need to get done because we are

repayment of stuff to defense
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's probably a good thing
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's about operating funds
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%

uh generally funded bonds
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%

we

01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%

01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
take that money
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%

readiness center renovations
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh which would be funded at six hundred
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.910 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
um

01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
there is

money left over from the 1.7 million
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
we could match the uh the fourth
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
we would still have the 415 000 that was
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
there but match the the
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
remaining 185
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
from lapses
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
so i would accept the motion that would
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%

01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
wanted you to do i was hoping we were
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
doing that it sounds
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
good it will not change the bottom line
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
right now in the department for what we
 
01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:52.870 align:start position:0%
right now in the department for what we
are

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
using for a general funded portion of
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh his request because everything else
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
change the 415 000
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%

from his testimony
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
and we would match it with some
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
repurposed money so that he gets the six
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars that he needs
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%

01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.750 align:start position:0%
this morning
and

01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
the life of the cannon mountain tramway
 
01:45:25.679 --> 01:45:27.109 align:start position:0%
the life of the cannon mountain tramway
is

01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think was originally
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
calculated 30 years it's at the 42-year
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
mark now
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
find a way to come up with 6.25 million
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
dollars to
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
do this project
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
um it would take three years
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the time we give them the money
 
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:50.229 align:start position:0%
from the time we give them the money
and

01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
they need the money in order to place an
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
order with the company that
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
designs and builds these
 
01:45:57.119 --> 01:45:58.709 align:start position:0%
designs and builds these
facilities

01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.149 align:start position:0%
facilities
um

01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
it would take two years
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
to design build it
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
and get it shipped here from
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
i don't remember it's denmark or france
 
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.830 align:start position:0%
i don't remember it's denmark or france
but

01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and then another year
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
to erect it
 
01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:15.910 align:start position:0%
to erect it
um

01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
we take in about 1.5 million dollars a
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
year in revenue from that operation
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh probably a new more efficient system
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
would bring in more
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the payback of that
 
01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the payback of that
is

01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
maybe a maximum of four years
 
01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.870 align:start position:0%
maybe a maximum of four years
and

01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
it's really something we need to look at
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
if we don't get it into this budget
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
um it's gonna wait another two years
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
and it'll put it five or six years down
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
i see your hand uh representative abbott
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
but this is probably a good time for me
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
to bring this up
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
in my current um
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan i think it's the
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
budget uh
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
government plan that was passed and
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
president bond assigned to the wow last
 
01:47:20.639 --> 01:47:21.669 align:start position:0%
president bond assigned to the wow last
week

01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
122 million dollars
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
coming to new hampshire
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
for state capital projects
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
um so some of the needs that we are
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
talking about will be
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the strings are on
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
that it is not here yet the guidance has
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
not been provided to the state debt on
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
how to use that money but it will come
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i have been told
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
um by the
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director that that it
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
will be nine laps in money meaning that
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
will not have to be spent this calendar
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
well i am supportive of the need to fix
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
the tramway and replace it
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't see how we can find
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
six million
 
01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.109 align:start position:0%
six million
plus

01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know what they would need to to
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
do even preliminary design on it
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
they need they need the total funding
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
available to commit to that company to
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
get them to do the design work out there
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
that i understand
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
where it fits into
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
our winter sports
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it is useful
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
and it does bring in before uh parts and
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
directive and natural resources
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
but to add six million to um
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
take this up
 
01:49:04.210 --> 01:49:04.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
i understand i'm just pleading the case
 
01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.070 align:start position:0%
i understand i'm just pleading the case
right

01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
is the money that's coming from the
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
federal government is that going to come
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
through this committee or is that going
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
to be that that is something that is
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
unknown i have asked the governor's
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
office that we'd be
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh at least
 
01:49:35.679 --> 01:49:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh at least
um

01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
at the table when it is decided by the
 
01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
at the table when it is decided by the
extent

01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
it may come in the fiscal committee to
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
be used
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
as a lot of federal grants are
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
but that is something that is unknown
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
i personally believe that
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
representatives of
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
this community senate capital uh budget
 
01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.189 align:start position:0%
this community senate capital uh budget
committee

01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh should be part of the negotiations on
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
how to do that
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
obviously a commission in house bill 2
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
to for the
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
forensic psychiatric hospital
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
for some 17 million dollars
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
that would either be
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
paid with federal funds or finally
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's outside of where we are right now
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
i've responded as an
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
to this
 
01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.590 align:start position:0%
to this
um

01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
that i think that uh
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
the governor the senate or even
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
house finance if they could get a hold
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
of the money would use would use part of
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
that 122
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
for that purpose but i would still leave
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
almost an entire capital election
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
right for youth and i think that having
 
01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.510 align:start position:0%
right for youth and i think that having
listened

01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
listened
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
to all of the
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh presentations
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
from all of the agencies over the last
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
month or so
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we are in good standing as to make
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations on how that
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
money should be spent and we can work as
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
a committee to prioritize
 
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded uh needs
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
and that to me that would be one of them
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
because it does it is a jewel in uh
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
our outdoor activities
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's just it's
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
the biggest attraction in northern new
 
01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:22.629 align:start position:0%
the biggest attraction in northern new
hampshire

01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
aside from the from the uh
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're a tourist state
 
01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:29.590 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're a tourist state
self-proclaimed

01:51:29.590 --> 01:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
self-proclaimed
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
it also provides rescue
 
01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
capabilities that we don't have
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise in weather conditions and
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
access to the communication system
 
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's on top of it
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah year round right use of that
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
tramway is it was
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
eye-opening to be at least the numbers
 
01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:52.470 align:start position:0%
eye-opening to be at least the numbers
for

01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh summer and fall especially and i
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
pointed out to
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
tom the other day that you know it's not
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
just the 6.2 million we're going to lose
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the tramway for a year
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
so we're going to lose a million yeah
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
while it's down
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
so it's actually a 7.5 million dollar
 
01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:12.790 align:start position:0%
so it's actually a 7.5 million dollar
commitment

01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:14.719 --> 01:52:27.030 align:start position:0%
and
i'm

01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.669 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
um

01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:31.679 --> 01:52:32.629 align:start position:0%
um
i

01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the presentation uh
 
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.669 align:start position:0%
in the presentation uh
um

01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
i just wasn't really comfortable with
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
the way it was
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
presented and when asking about the
 
01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.870 align:start position:0%
presented and when asking about the
controls

01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
controls
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
from the tram
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
and whether the department of
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
information technology had been
 
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.589 align:start position:0%
information technology had been
consulted

01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
consulted
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the response was no and i just think
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the planning i'm not opposed
 
01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.350 align:start position:0%
in terms of the planning i'm not opposed
to

01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
the tram
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
the plan
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
crystallized a little bit more
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
and you know how it would be approached
 
01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
and you know how it would be approached
and

01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's just the way i feel about it
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
i am i've been listening i have a
 
01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.629 align:start position:0%
i am i've been listening i have a
question

01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay look forward to having
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
this additional federal money
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
or capital projects
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
if we were to
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
indicate our desire to go forward with
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
something like the tramway
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we put a dollar in the hospital 25
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
to say and then with words in our board
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
by extended committee report that says
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
we support this and the federal funding
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
you could you could put a note in so
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what they did in
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 with the um youth
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh the forensic unit
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was structured in a way to say if
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
there's federal dollars that can be used
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
then that will be the first dollars that
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
shall be used and then they added the
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation
 
01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.709 align:start position:0%
capital appropriation
um

01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
you could make a statement
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
in i don't know if i would put a dollar
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
in a line
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
but you could admit i think you could
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
probably include a section that says
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
um you know if federal dollars were to
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
become available you know the the
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
committee's priority of projects would
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
be a b and c but i'd run that by the
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
drafting attorneys
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
i think that we would like to
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
put something
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
looking around the committee
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
at least on the tramway for them to look
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
we can revisit this and when we get some
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
some words and figure out what we can do
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
now it does not mean that it will
 
01:55:02.719 --> 01:55:10.550 align:start position:0%
now it does not mean that it will
survive

01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
could we appropriate some amount of
 
01:55:12.719 --> 01:55:14.310 align:start position:0%
could we appropriate some amount of
money

01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
to allow them to study it and come back
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
with a proposal like
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative abbott is well and that's
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
what i i guess when i asked you that
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
question earlier
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
about if they have given you a number
 
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:30.550 align:start position:0%
about if they have given you a number
for

01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
what i said besides it didn't
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that the
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
blueprints the timepiece but uh
 
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.149 align:start position:0%
blueprints the timepiece but uh
um

01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
what is it we need how much
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
they may already have all that uh if you
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
could check and we could
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
talk about it at my next uh
 
01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.310 align:start position:0%
talk about it at my next uh
workstation

01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
workstation
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
i think that there is enough interest on
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
even if it is only but our statement
 
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
even if it is only but our statement
that

01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
like to see something done with some of
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
but the rest of
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
cultural resource natural cultural
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
resources anybody have any problems with
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
what the government has proposed mr
 
01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.510 align:start position:0%
what the government has proposed mr
chairman

01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
um i am
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
supportive of representative thompson's
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts on canada mountain but
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
with representative advent the chairman
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
i just don't know where we find that
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
funding unless the feds come in
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
but this this committee has had a long
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
stand policy
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
of funding critical needs for the state
 
01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.629 align:start position:0%
of funding critical needs for the state
parks

01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
parks
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
and i know that uh they approved their
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
funding but i would like to
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
raise uh raise the thought of adding 150
 
01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
raise uh raise the thought of adding 150
000

01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
into this budget
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of critical maintenance
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
to be defined
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
by the department and approved by some
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's not enough if i could mr chairman
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an awful lot of money but
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh i can speak to uh white lake state
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
park uh in the area of my of my district
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
that even
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
a load of gravel uh not found in the
 
01:57:39.199 --> 01:57:40.870 align:start position:0%
a load of gravel uh not found in the
budget

01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
for a year uh had people hopping up and
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
down just driving to the beach
 
01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:47.990 align:start position:0%
down just driving to the beach
so

01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
like i said we've had a long-standing
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
policy from all the chairmen uh for all
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
the committees in the 18 years
 
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:55.910 align:start position:0%
the committees in the 18 years
and

that we would add at this point in time

150 000
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh to this budget for uh critical

02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
one million dollars for the community
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%

02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
and when i looked at
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
their revised presentation which
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
everybody should have
 
02:04:49.599 --> 02:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
everybody should have
they're

02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
they divided critical maintenance in the
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
two portions the first portion was just
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
right at one million dollars
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
so i would be supportive of doing that
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
and again
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
um i'll talk a little bit later

will say this

02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
some of us received from
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
about moving the
 
02:07:47.119 --> 02:07:48.870 align:start position:0%
about moving the

to littleton
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
but the cost of that is five million
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to do that
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
as i have told a couple people who have
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
called me
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see how living within our means
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
we can do that at this point
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that perhaps when we
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
start talking about
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
adding a footnote into the capital
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
budget about federal funds
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
we would at least that portion of the
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
if not more and we can talk about that
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
one at our next work session
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
because i think that we need to make it
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
clear to the people who
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
receive this money that we have some
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on how to get spent
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think that anybody on
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
this committee disagrees with that
 
02:08:43.119 --> 02:08:44.229 align:start position:0%
this committee disagrees with that
statement

02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
um because we are the ones who have
 
02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
um because we are the ones who have
worked

02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
worked
 
02:08:52.130 --> 02:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
these issues but we've also heard from
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
all of the agencies
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
so we may come up with a modified list
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
of what we think is truly critical and
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
and some of the stuff in the column
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
system is truly critical
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether or not
 
02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:14.709 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether or not
we

02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
see what the governor is proposing about
 
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
the two
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
higher education systems
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
the buildings and programs still have to
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that we can work
 
02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it at that we can work
on

02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
what we
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
what language and what we think needs to
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
at least be pointed out that we would
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
like to see the federal money because
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
that federal money may come in and be
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
i think again i am you know i really
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't think the senate should get all
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
the boards you know we should have a say
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the senate comes after
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
us so sometimes they can
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh get do things that we we
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
can't or we were more cautious about it
 
02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.270 align:start position:0%
can't or we were more cautious about it
fiscally

02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
fiscally
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
so and i just want to elaborate i
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
receive calls from people in my area and
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
i ask them why are you interested in
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
moving this from berlin to
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
littleton they said it'd be easier for
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
people to take courses
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
from even claremont because all they
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
have to do is hop on even though it's in
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
vermont 91 and it's faster than going to
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
berlin it saves about an hour
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
so they're lobbying me on this that i
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
can't promise at the time i didn't know
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
the amount you know but i said i made no
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
promises but if we could put in language
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
some of that federal money that would be
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
i used to be that would be great as far
 
02:10:34.709 --> 02:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
as i'm concerned okay
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
we will have to
 
02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.910 align:start position:0%
we will have to
talk

02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
talk
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
i i'm against moving to college this
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
program from berlin to littleton
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh neither berlin nor littleton is in my
 
02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
uh neither berlin nor littleton is in my
district

02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
but um there are a lot of people that
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
come from the colebrook area
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
and errol and that that go to that
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
college um
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
specifically some of them to take the
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
diesel program
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
and for them to have to go to littleton
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
when we asked questions of the of the
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
doe when they were here to testify i
 
02:11:12.149 --> 02:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
asked what percentage they thought
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
they'd increase their
 
02:11:14.239 --> 02:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
they'd increase their
their

02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
school population by and said they
 
02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
thought around 20
 
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
which tells me if you think it's around
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
20 you haven't done enough research
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
to find out what it is and spend 5
 
02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.709 align:start position:0%
to find out what it is and spend 5
million

02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
on a guess that that's going to be a
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
better program than one we already have
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
particularly this
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
or comments about the community college
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
i know that they have
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
several requests into all of us
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they've done a lot of work they're
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
trying to narrow down what they need
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
but again
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
well it's not quite a zero-sum game it's
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
pretty close at this point

which
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
moves around
 
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
but it's a
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
highway-funded portion of it
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
it changes the bottom line
 
02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
it changes the bottom line
from

02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%

02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
and it's all highway funds like
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
generally funded
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
this is something that
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
we had agreed to
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
when we were discussing what
 
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the department had come in and asked to
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
do with
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%

and the rest
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
ask somebody
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'll do it uh
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
we have in front of you
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
that be
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
unapproved until we improve it it will
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
have to be incorporated into the overall
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
because there's only one amendment that
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
can go forward
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is and it is what we
 
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:15.349 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is and it is what we
discussed

02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
if the department is online i think they
 
02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
if the department is online i think they
are

02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
if they have
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
they were
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
if they have any
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
comments or questions i would take them
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
about this i think it is what
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%

work session

we did discuss and

reached an agreement on the unh
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
university system 15 million dollars
 
02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
anybody change their mind or want to add
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
anything to that at this point
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
we've gone through every agent
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
subject to some
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
some changes maybe after we hear from
 
02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:13.110 align:start position:0%
some changes maybe after we hear from
them

02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:15.670 align:start position:0%
them
um

02:25:15.670 --> 02:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
those agencies you've got to come back
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
in and see
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
with some of the changes we've made and
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
not all of that
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
um we are within
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
of hundred thousand dollars
 
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
of where the governor proposed in his
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
original budget despite adding
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
these projects
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
by adding
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
some other things
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we still have
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
some things we need to talk about
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
but overall we stayed pretty close to
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that the government
 
02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:57.670 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount that the government
proposed

02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:59.030 align:start position:0%
proposed
which

02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
well not a requirement
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
is still a good thing when we try to go
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
selling this to the total membership of
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:28.309 align:start position:0%
the house
representatives

02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.319 --> 02:26:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
which

02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.359 --> 02:26:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
we retained
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
two bills
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh to see if we could fit them into the
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.319 --> 02:27:05.429 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we have the
 
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
agencies coming that one
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
i am going to
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
recess the committee until
 
02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:16.630 align:start position:0%
recess the committee until
pm

02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
pm
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
um so those of us who actually laid it
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
in the carpet into the room and go find
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
some place open or someplace to eat
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of you can squirt it out
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
wherever you go
 
02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
when you do it too
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
but the committee will be in recess
 
02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:36.870 align:start position:0%
but the committee will be in recess
until

02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh 1 pm when we will be 12
 
02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:42.790 align:start position:0%
uh 1 pm when we will be 12
the

02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
agencies that we ask to come back and
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
talk about a couple of things
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
and then we will discuss the two
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh retain bills
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
one final quick look at everything that
 
02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
we've already done
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're still all on
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
the same page
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
it is going very well i thank the
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee for
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
all of their hard work so far
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we're moving
 
02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:09.190 align:start position:0%
and we're moving
along

02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
along
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
quite well and i appreciate that
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
with that the committee is in recess
 
02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
with that the committee is in recess
until

02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:28:15.520 --> 02:28:16.389 align:start position:0%
until
uh

02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh

[Music]

03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
1pm

03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
1pm
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call the
 
03:31:02.070 --> 03:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
public works and highways committee back
 
03:31:02.080 --> 03:31:03.110 align:start position:0%
public works and highways committee back
into

03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:31:03.120 --> 03:31:05.190 align:start position:0%
into
session

03:31:05.190 --> 03:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:31:07.510 --> 03:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
at this point some members of the
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee had asked
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
various members of agencies to come in
 
03:31:17.110 --> 03:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
and discuss some things first one up i'd
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
like to bring um commissioner boulay of
 
03:31:20.640 --> 03:31:24.630 align:start position:0%
like to bring um commissioner boulay of
doit

03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.640 --> 03:31:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
yep

03:31:29.190 --> 03:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
so there have been
 
03:31:44.790 --> 03:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of the members who have some
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
the overall magnitude that i see within
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
i believe some of them have questions
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
about maybe scalability or
 
03:32:00.070 --> 03:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are and i'll begin
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:08.309 --> 03:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh good to see
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
you commissioner um and thank you for
 
03:32:12.630 --> 03:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
all you've done the past year getting us
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
up and running and remote etc etc i know
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a hurdle
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
so as the chairman said when we look at
 
03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:22.870 align:start position:0%
so as the chairman said when we look at
the

03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:22.880 --> 03:32:24.150 align:start position:0%
the
budget

03:32:24.150 --> 03:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:32:27.190 --> 03:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
35 million dollars of capital funds are
 
03:32:27.200 --> 03:32:28.229 align:start position:0%
35 million dollars of capital funds are
being

03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
suggested by the governor to be
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated for it costs and as you
 
03:32:33.120 --> 03:32:34.150 align:start position:0%
appropriated for it costs and as you
yourself

03:32:34.150 --> 03:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
03:32:35.990 --> 03:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
have observed and even the budget
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
director observed this is
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
a much bigger slice of the capital
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
budget than there has been in the past
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:32:47.070 --> 03:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to talk to you about
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
scalability on
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
some of them i mean we realized that the
 
03:32:51.680 --> 03:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
some of them i mean we realized that the
dhhs

03:32:54.070 --> 03:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
issues were going to get fined by the
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
federal government if we don't comply
 
03:32:58.560 --> 03:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
federal government if we don't comply
but

03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
there was some uh question raised by a
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
couple of people about the one stop uh
 
03:33:06.389 --> 03:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
in the d
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
e s budget it was about five million
 
03:33:09.520 --> 03:33:11.349 align:start position:0%
e s budget it was about five million
dollars

03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that was one thing i was going to ask
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
you about
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
if there was any scalability there you
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
could discuss with us or maybe
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
since you have an idea of the overall
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
situation you could make some
 
03:33:27.190 --> 03:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
suggestions so thank you
 
03:33:28.710 --> 03:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ebel
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
glad to see you're back on the it
 
03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
council we'll be uh we're going to have
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
a meeting pretty soon lots of good
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
topics um i'd like to first start i'm
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
if the committee will indulge me for a
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
moment i will review the process
 
03:33:45.910 --> 03:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
we went through to get to the governor's
 
03:33:48.790 --> 03:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
budget and then i'll talk about some
 
03:33:51.269 --> 03:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
some factors i think that led to where
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
we are today and then we can go into how
 
03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
where we take it from here
 
03:33:56.800 --> 03:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
where we take it from here
um

03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:57.600 --> 03:33:58.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:00.630 --> 03:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
the we did actually work with all the
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to develop their capital uh
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
technology related capital budgets and
 
03:34:06.790 --> 03:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
03:34:08.950 --> 03:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
we did um compare those to their
 
03:34:11.190 --> 03:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
strategic plans to make sure that they
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
actually met uh
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
fit in with the plans
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and that we understood where each of
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
those projects stood in the overall
 
03:34:21.190 --> 03:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
agency prioritization
 
03:34:24.150 --> 03:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
we then um used a model we built we've
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
been using now it's our third biennium
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
using this model it's a kind of a
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
complex model i'd be happy to share it
 
03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
with you folks sometime when you have a
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
bit more time but um
 
03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
it really takes into a bunch of factors
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
like a potential impact on citizens
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
federal leverage for example is a big
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
one organizational readiness to do the
 
03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
project is is a factor
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so you know the federal or the other
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
funds leverage kind of a big deal and
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why you see a
 
03:34:54.790 --> 03:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
lot of hhs projects rising to the top of
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
the prioritization
 
03:34:56.720 --> 03:34:59.269 align:start position:0%
the prioritization
matrix

03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
matrix
 
03:34:59.279 --> 03:35:00.229 align:start position:0%
matrix
so

03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the last couple of biennia the
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
governor has drawn a line in the
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
prioritized list he might
 
03:35:08.790 --> 03:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
decide to tweak the prioritized list
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
and this this particular biennium that i
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
think what we put forward was what was
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
accepted by the governor
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
and um so i asked specifically in
 
03:35:20.870 --> 03:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
anticipation of this hearing i asked the
 
03:35:22.950 --> 03:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
governor's office specifically about you
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
know it's a big big jump in um
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
in dollars and you know
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know what's your number one reason
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
for that and and the the
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
answer was
 
03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward they you know
 
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
particularly in the light of the last
 
03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
year or so that the recognition that
 
03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
more than ever
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
technology is driving our citizen
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
services efforts
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
is reflective of what of the amounts
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
that the governor put forward as a
 
03:35:51.190 --> 03:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion so that was the that was one
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
factor um another factor
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
is the overall uh technology density
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
which i think is really a core
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
corollary of the first factor it keeps
 
03:36:03.429 --> 03:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
increasing in our agency partners you
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
know we keep
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
finding that you know adding technology
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
is the way to deliver uh citizen
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
services in in the world as we live in
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
it today
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
um there were another factor uh was um
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know last biennium was a long time
 
03:36:17.760 --> 03:36:18.790 align:start position:0%
you know last biennium was a long time
low

03:36:18.790 --> 03:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
low
 
03:36:20.229 --> 03:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
i actually looked back all the way as
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
far as i could find records i think it
 
03:36:23.670 --> 03:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
was 10 11.
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
and last biennium was an all-time low
 
03:36:29.110 --> 03:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
for technology projects which i think
 
03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
probably created some pent-up demand in
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
this biennium to have more in larger
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
projects and and
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
and again a corollary to that
 
03:36:40.150 --> 03:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
is that it did create some deferred
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance um
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
particularly in health and human
 
03:36:45.190 --> 03:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
services where they had some things
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
where we've actually fallen off the
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
compliance curve and now we're either
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
getting find this this biennium or about
 
03:36:53.190 --> 03:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
to get fined
 
03:36:55.510 --> 03:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're not having remain compliant with
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
our whether with uh the requirements
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
from our federal partners um and and i
 
03:37:02.309 --> 03:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
would actually say um environmental
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
services is one of those where we you
 
03:37:05.670 --> 03:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
know we have some deferred maintenance
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
we those those systems in one stop are
 
03:37:08.720 --> 03:37:09.670 align:start position:0%
we those those systems in one stop are
um

03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:11.510 --> 03:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're from a technology
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
perspective they're pretty old some of
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
you may recall that we we actually we
 
03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
did a cyber a statewide comprehensive
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
cyber assessment
 
03:37:22.710 --> 03:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh last year and we found some issues
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
with some of our systems including one
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
stop and
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
what we found overall
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the state from an application
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
perspective was
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
the age of the technology um
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
had a direct relationship to the
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
likelihood that there might be cyber
 
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities because the back in the
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
day when we were writing applications 25
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
people weren't worried about cyber
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
security very much back then and now
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal so
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
that i'd say on the one stop there's a
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
lot of opportunity to improve our
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
citizen service capabilities improve the
 
03:38:01.830 --> 03:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
reliability of what we offer
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
and i think i think
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
is here as well today so it might you
 
03:38:09.750 --> 03:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
know at some point you know i'd like to
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
hear his take on it but from a business
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
perspective i know that he's very
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
supportive of it
 
03:38:14.080 --> 03:38:15.269 align:start position:0%
supportive of it
now

03:38:15.269 --> 03:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
i've been in situations plenty of times
 
03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:18.630 align:start position:0%
i've been in situations plenty of times
where

03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:38:21.030 --> 03:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
a proposed budget isn't what gets passed
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
either in the private sector or in the
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
public setting as we're here today
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
there's really two ways of approaching
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
that if if it's the will of the
 
03:38:30.950 --> 03:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee to reduce the amount of tech
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
spend in in the capital
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
budget then there's kind of a couple
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
ways one like uh is as rep people
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned scalability i'm assuming that
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't is not referring to scaling up
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
so um you know we can
 
03:38:46.469 --> 03:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
we can make asks uh we can all go and
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
say talk to the agencies and say hey you
 
03:38:48.239 --> 03:38:49.190 align:start position:0%
say talk to the agencies and say hey you
know

03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
we need to sharpen our pencils a bit
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
here and
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know i thought about that a bit from
 
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
my own perspective from the from what
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
i've asked for
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
i think there's almost always potential
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
for scalability
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
um and then is you know are all of these
 
03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
um you know with the committee
 
03:39:10.229 --> 03:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
prioritize things in a similar fashion
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
as the governor um
 
03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
as the governor um
we

03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:13.429 align:start position:0%
we
um

03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:14.870 --> 03:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know we agree with the
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
prioritization we're the ones that came
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
up with it
 
03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:18.790 align:start position:0%
up with it
um

03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
there it may be that we
 
03:39:22.550 --> 03:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to do a little less
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
in in this biennium and then and then
 
03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
move some of that forward in a future
 
03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
biennium i mean one of the challenges
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
with um
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
with health and human services is that
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
in order to get a good particularly on
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
those 90 10
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
projects to get a really good general
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
funds bump you have to take a really big
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
slice out of the project which isn't um
 
03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
which isn't always going to be healthy
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
for the project so
 
03:39:50.790 --> 03:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that's my those are my formal remarks
 
03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up follow up mr chair
 
03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:09.670 align:start position:0%
i'll follow up follow up mr chair
um

03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i i would just ask um
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
for instance with the with the one stop
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
or any of these things if you took 300
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
000 off or 100 000 i mean does it really
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
affect the ability of the project to go
 
03:40:27.040 --> 03:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
affect the ability of the project to go
forward

03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
um i i would think there's opportunity
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
in them
 
03:40:32.880 --> 03:40:33.590 align:start position:0%
in them
to

03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
i've done that
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
many times in my career where you say um
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
hey let's
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know let's not cut projects but
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
let's scale them back a little bit and
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
then if you do it to all of them
 
03:40:45.830 --> 03:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
in a similar way it actually turns into
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
a reasonable amount of money so you know
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.590 --> 03:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i my my agency um counterparts
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
might not agree with me
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
i mean just the mere fact that uh doit
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
is presumptuous enough to uh prioritize
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
all of the agency projects against each
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
other versus treating them as stovepipes
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
is a little bit
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know is a little problematic so me
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
is based on my experience with doing
 
03:41:17.590 --> 03:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
lots of budgets for you know decades and
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
decades and
 
03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
i've found that you know if you need to
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
get if you need to get a little bit
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
lower then that that proportional effect
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
in combination with other things can can
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
well in the case of follow-up mr chair
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
in the case of des there's a coastal
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
flooding program that needs a maybe
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
another three hundred thousand dollars
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
so you know i just i was that was one of
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
the reasons i was asking
 
03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and i would since the commissioner
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
scott he i believe was here i think uh i
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
would ask him to comment on whether he
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
would cut you know money elsewhere or
 
03:42:03.190 --> 03:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.399 --> 03:42:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the projects that you manage
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
mr director
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
where um
 
03:42:21.190 --> 03:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
where are we
 
03:42:23.190 --> 03:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
just out of date
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
what ones of these projects are the most
 
03:42:25.279 --> 03:42:29.429 align:start position:0%
what ones of these projects are the most
critical

03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
well the um
 
03:42:33.990 --> 03:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'd say you know in terms of the total
 
03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and impacts to citizens which is
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
how we prioritize
 
03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know those hhs projects that
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
particularly like uh medicaid
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh mmis and and the other hhs projects
 
03:42:46.960 --> 03:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
uh mmis and and the other hhs projects
where

03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:42:47.840 --> 03:42:48.870 align:start position:0%
where
we're

03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
compromising our ability to leverage
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
federal funds by not staying up to date
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that's one if you measure it that way
 
03:42:58.150 --> 03:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
then those are pretty high priorities um
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
then if you say okay how where are we in
 
03:43:02.710 --> 03:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to deliver
 
03:43:04.630 --> 03:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
the citizen services that that are
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
expected then i think all of these
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
projects fall into that
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
that category that we do have a lot
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
of very outdated technology it's very
 
03:43:15.990 --> 03:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
similar i mean i hear that we you hear
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
the same testimony
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
um from the building you know folks
 
03:43:22.710 --> 03:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
talking about building and plant right
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
there you know whether it's a
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a um you know septic uh system at
 
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
glencliff or whatever you know there's
 
03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of deferred maintenance
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
and can we run systems in the state a
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
lot longer than
 
03:43:37.830 --> 03:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
than i've ever seen systems run before
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
in my career and on average so 30 years
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
is not unusual uh the revenue system
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
that they're replacing now is over 30
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
years old liquors
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know point of sale and um
 
03:43:55.030 --> 03:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
and back in the house processing that
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
associated processing is
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
pushing 30 years old so you know the
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
driver license system where you're
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
placed a couple years ago and dmv was
 
03:44:05.830 --> 03:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
over 30 years old so it's pretty pretty
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
common now i'm i'm a big fan of running
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
systems for a long time to get the most
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
investment out of them
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
and so you know a decade maybe even 15
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
or 20 years might not be the wrong thing
 
03:44:17.520 --> 03:44:18.790 align:start position:0%
or 20 years might not be the wrong thing
30

03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
30
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
to usually too much because you're then
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're you know you're you're past your
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
diminished diminishing points of return
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
and you're investing in something that
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
isn't worth investing in anymore
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
but it does cost money to replace
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
systems as you see so
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
i think that's my best generic answer to
 
03:44:35.279 --> 03:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
i think that's my best generic answer to
that

03:44:37.590 --> 03:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:37.600 --> 03:44:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:44:39.670 --> 03:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
um for the
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
03:44:47.910 --> 03:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
i i uh for the chairman i i'm hoping
 
03:44:49.910 --> 03:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be able to ask commissioner scott a
 
03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
question later if they said he's out
 
03:44:51.520 --> 03:44:52.469 align:start position:0%
question later if they said he's out
there

03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:44:54.309 --> 03:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
so as far as processing payments to the
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
state i know that there are some
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
standalone systems
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we're told about
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
health and human services and some of
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
the others do we have the standard
 
03:45:07.439 --> 03:45:09.750 align:start position:0%
the others do we have the standard
platform

03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
platform
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
that that we use for the processing of
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
credit cards example if i could
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
example subsurface has a as a
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
as the ability to pay
 
03:45:28.630 --> 03:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
fees online but the heritage bureau does
 
03:45:28.640 --> 03:45:29.590 align:start position:0%
fees online but the heritage bureau does
not

03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:45:32.550 --> 03:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
03:45:34.229 --> 03:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
with the part of the upgrade
 
03:45:36.150 --> 03:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott's talking about that
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
they will take care of that
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
in the department supposedly going
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
forward but are we using the same
 
03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
company or the same format
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
on all of our all of our our processing
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
i understand that could change in the
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
next six months but are we at least
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
across your platforms
 
03:45:56.319 --> 03:45:57.269 align:start position:0%
across your platforms
um

03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
well it starts with who's who's our um
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
the bank we're working with or the
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
entity we're working with to do the
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
credit card processing and that's a
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's a single statewide contract
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
currently with chase that uh department
 
03:46:13.990 --> 03:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
of administrative services manages
 
03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:15.269 align:start position:0%
of administrative services manages
and

03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
in our credit card payments flow through
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
that the largest volume of those as you
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
might guess is from liquor
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
and liquor drives
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
liquor's volume drives our pricing for
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
back-end credit card processing and then
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
you look at well what is the use case so
 
03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
if the use case for example with
 
03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
with some of the if you have three
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
different applications that are taking
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
credit card processing and the vendor
 
03:46:41.429 --> 03:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
built-in credit card processing into
 
03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
that application but it may look
 
03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique to the citizen even if
 
03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique to the citizen even if
it's

03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
the same back-end process as you
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned but our goal is to to have
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
as small number as possible of different
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
use cases that people have to absorb and
 
03:47:01.910 --> 03:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
in your case you know the the fact that
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a single agency with
 
03:47:03.439 --> 03:47:04.469 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with a single agency with
a

03:47:04.469 --> 03:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
single set of applications i mean it's a
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation that
 
03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:09.510 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation that
that

03:47:09.510 --> 03:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
that we should be have a single look and
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
feel for the citizen it's all the same
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
on the back end generally speaking now
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's some variation there over the
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
almost six years i've been doing this
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
um you know if administrative services
 
03:47:25.990 --> 03:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
changes over the company that's on the
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
back end
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
then it takes us a year or more to
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
switch all the agencies over so that
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's that
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
possibility on back end with being
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
different for a while but
 
03:47:39.990 --> 03:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:40.000 --> 03:47:42.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:50.229 --> 03:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you i'd like to remain i'd
 
03:47:54.550 --> 03:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
like to remain here just to support
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott if i know
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
but before i
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
call um commissioner scott up i do have
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
the treasurer on
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
that affordability before we got too far
 
03:48:14.950 --> 03:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
into this whole thing let's stay on
 
03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:16.010 align:start position:0%
into this whole thing let's stay on

adam treasurer did you want miss miller
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon uh thanks thank you mr
 
03:48:37.110 --> 03:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
chairman yes ms miller is um is um on
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
the call as well if if
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
someone could bring her
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
up and i think there was a question and
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
apologies i missed her while i was um
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the question that had been raised
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
was about um
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
debt affordability at a couple different
 
03:49:05.229 --> 03:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
levels i know you did send out
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct um
 
03:49:19.030 --> 03:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
so um if if i recall correctly i was
 
03:49:20.710 --> 03:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
asked to um
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
um just very you know essentially run a
 
03:49:25.110 --> 03:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
few numbers um
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
if um
 
03:49:29.429 --> 03:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
if the committee were to approve
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
um several um i believe it was 125
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
130 million
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
um i think the last one was 135 million
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
so i was um i was asked to to see if i
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
could run some numbers to to see what
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
that will do to the uh debt to revenue
 
03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:48.870 align:start position:0%
that will do to the uh debt to revenue
ratio

03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
ratio
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
and what i what i was i think i
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned to um to the committee in the
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
past um
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
you know i think a change of 5 million
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impact the ratio so what i did
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
is i just
 
03:50:04.309 --> 03:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
i ran all the numbers and and the only
 
03:50:04.319 --> 03:50:05.349 align:start position:0%
i ran all the numbers and and the only
one

03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:50:05.359 --> 03:50:06.389 align:start position:0%
one
um

03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
the only number that uh really changed
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the needle a bit
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
was the 135 million
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh figure in in our data affordability
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
schedule so
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so what i was trying to explain um in
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
the letter that i that in the memo that
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
i sent is um
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
really a change like that
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
even even if even if
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
even if um there were bonding
 
03:50:33.670 --> 03:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
authorizations of 135 million
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the impact on the debt to governor ratio
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
is very minimal
 
03:50:39.990 --> 03:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
so it's just a matter of
 
03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:41.830 align:start position:0%
so it's just a matter of
um

03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
really the committees the committee's
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
conviction as to you know how high they
 
03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
would like to go
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
um above the 125
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
sort of threshold 120 i'm sorry 120
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
million threshold that we
 
03:50:58.229 --> 03:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
included in our calculations and in our
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
assumptions that we provided through the
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that affordability study um report
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
that we distributed a couple of weeks
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
ago i believe
 
03:51:10.150 --> 03:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so again so those those words just
 
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
the comments that i wanted to make and
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i and i was trying to explain that
 
03:51:17.349 --> 03:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
in the memo but um
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
but again again i think it is it is um i
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
will say
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
that it is a committee's um decision to
 
03:51:26.710 --> 03:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
03:51:26.720 --> 03:51:28.070 align:start position:0%
to decide
um

03:51:28.070 --> 03:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know at what level you want to go
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know a nexus of the 120 million that
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know we use as a threshold to
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
calculate um that affordability and how
 
03:51:42.070 --> 03:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
much capacity the state will have to
 
03:51:44.469 --> 03:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
to absorb additional debt
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
again as a policy decision um
 
03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
i always say i feel like you know
 
03:51:51.990 --> 03:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
i am responsible for running the numbers
 
03:51:53.830 --> 03:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
so happy to provide all the numbers that
 
03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
you want me to run
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
um but again and this for this
 
03:51:59.510 --> 03:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
particular question that's what i could
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i can just um you know add
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't at least to the right uh
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
dead derivative ratio it doesn't have a
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
huge impact so the stake could perfectly
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
absorb that change
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
if the committee uh decides to to do
 
03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:15.510 align:start position:0%
if the committee uh decides to to do
that

03:52:15.510 --> 03:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:17.349 --> 03:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i noticed that you did include that
 
03:52:22.229 --> 03:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
if we went to that
 
03:52:25.110 --> 03:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
135 if we increase our
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure debt service expenditure by
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
a little over 22 million
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
with the life of the bond
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's correct so um
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the more we bond that would be
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know the man that will um it will be
 
03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
for death service so that obviously will
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
occur over a period of 20 years but i
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give you a figure of you
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
know an amount that you know that really
 
03:52:51.510 --> 03:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
is what it will
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
it will translate to um an additional 15
 
03:52:56.070 --> 03:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
50 million
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
will be about 22 million over the life
 
03:53:00.630 --> 03:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the bond
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:01.680 --> 03:53:04.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

03:53:04.229 --> 03:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for coming
 
03:53:06.479 --> 03:53:07.349 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for coming
um

03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:10.150 --> 03:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i i went back and i looked at the
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
study uh last night and i just want to
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
ask you a question um
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
so you do
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
include the full 50 million for the pfas
 
03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh bonding in your estimates right
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct yes because i saw that
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
um i think it was for 2022 at least the
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
version i looked at or the the ratio was
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
6.2 and then it went up to 6.7 and the
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
footnotes mentioned it was because of
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
the 50 million um
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
bonding so
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have spoken to des and i know the
 
03:53:49.349 --> 03:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner is here i know that they
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate at least
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
the last i heard that they're going to
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
go you know full bore with the 50
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
million um
 
03:54:00.790 --> 03:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
but i just want to clarify that that's
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's in there in anticipation that you
 
03:54:06.389 --> 03:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
you have to put in capacity
 
03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
exactly and and thank you for the
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
question and that is um because that was
 
03:54:13.510 --> 03:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
already authorized we have to either
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know to be conservative we already
 
03:54:18.030 --> 03:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
put it in that fiscal year
 
03:54:18.040 --> 03:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
put it in that fiscal year
2022

03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
2022
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we could spread it out we
 
03:54:24.150 --> 03:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
could do you know however um again
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're correct we haven't heard details
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
about how that you know how that project
 
03:54:30.309 --> 03:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
is going we just wanted to be
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
conservative and include that amount and
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
to see what that will do to our our
 
03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:36.150 align:start position:0%
to see what that will do to our our
metrics

03:54:36.150 --> 03:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
metrics
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so we we wanted to see that even
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
when we include that 50 million our
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
metrics remain healthy
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
but again it's something that we just
 
03:54:46.389 --> 03:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
have to keep in mind as more projects
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
are um approved and and that was an
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
authorization that happened
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh not during the um
 
03:54:56.790 --> 03:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
approval of house bill 25 so that's you
 
03:54:56.800 --> 03:54:58.389 align:start position:0%
approval of house bill 25 so that's you
know

03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
we repeat the message we want to repeat
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
the message saying you know it's good to
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
maintain that capacity in case there's a
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
need for that additional bond and
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
authorization that project that you know
 
03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
it really is needed and and he can't
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
wait so that way we're able to have you
 
03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
wait so that way we're able to have you
know

03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
the state will have that ability to
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
absorb that debt
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
and and and again looking at the numbers
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
in our metrics um those um appear to be
 
03:55:24.720 --> 03:55:26.630 align:start position:0%
in our metrics um those um appear to be
um

03:55:26.630 --> 03:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:28.870 --> 03:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we will still be in a very good
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
position if we maintain that um you know
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
that discipline as as
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
again as the state has done it for for
 
03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
many years
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
can i also follow up mr chair
 
03:55:41.680 --> 03:55:42.550 align:start position:0%
can i also follow up mr chair
um

03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
i know it's a very fuzzy situation with
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
the forensic hospital but have you
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
reflected any potential bonding for that
 
03:55:53.830 --> 03:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.229 --> 03:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh so we learned about that
 
03:55:58.389 --> 03:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
possibility of having that bond and
 
03:56:00.550 --> 03:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
authorization in
 
03:56:03.429 --> 03:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
if no federal funds are received um
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
so well so so yes so including that
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
again unclear how much and it's going to
 
03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
be authorized in house bill 25
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
for this time around but if we added
 
03:56:15.269 --> 03:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
that amount
 
03:56:15.279 --> 03:56:16.150 align:start position:0%
that amount
um

03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know what i can't what i can what i
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
can comment on is is
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
for any
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
additional 50 million um that
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
is authorized
 
03:56:30.070 --> 03:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the ratio would change um
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
between point two percent between two
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
and three point three percent between
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
point two and point three percent so
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
just to give us an idea what what that
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
does so if if that went to pass so we
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
will have to add that to our um
 
03:56:46.640 --> 03:56:48.309 align:start position:0%
will have to add that to our um
um

03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
total of uh
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
bond then already be authorized so so
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes we have to continue so as soon as we
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
hear the possibility of authorizing um
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
um you know additional capital
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
appropriations that need to be bonded we
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
do include them in the calculation at
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
least we keep in mind and we start
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
tracking you know
 
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
how much
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
our numbers could change depending of
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
other

03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:57:22.950 --> 03:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for doing
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
the work and
 
03:57:29.429 --> 03:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
coming back to us with
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
the answer question we do appreciate it
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
it is a pleasure thank you for having us
 
03:57:34.800 --> 03:57:37.429 align:start position:0%
it is a pleasure thank you for having us
back

03:57:37.429 --> 03:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:40.150 --> 03:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
um since the question has been raised a
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
couple of times uh we were talking to
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner delay
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
if our commissioner scott could come up
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
be brought up and with whoever else he
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.110 --> 03:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
whatever else
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:09.910 --> 03:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair and now members
 
03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh while i was getting
 
03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh elevated i dropped out so i i don't
 
03:58:14.319 --> 03:58:15.269 align:start position:0%
uh elevated i dropped out so i i don't
know

03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
the last 30 seconds if you said
 
03:58:17.199 --> 03:58:18.309 align:start position:0%
the last 30 seconds if you said
something

03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh so again i'm bob scott with the
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:27.429 --> 03:58:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you the questions that have
 
03:58:27.439 --> 03:58:28.630 align:start position:0%
uh thank you the questions that have
been

03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
raised about under your department the
 
03:58:31.840 --> 03:58:33.269 align:start position:0%
raised about under your department the
uh

03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
the one-stop
 
03:58:34.800 --> 03:58:36.469 align:start position:0%
the one-stop
um

03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriation for the one-stop
 
03:58:40.000 --> 03:58:41.269 align:start position:0%
the appropriation for the one-stop
system

03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that could be
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
scalable or
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
by any or two
 
03:58:47.920 --> 03:58:49.189 align:start position:0%
by any or two
and

03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
where you see it going
 
03:58:55.110 --> 03:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh short short answer
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
is yes
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
this is not an all or nothing uh i i
 
03:59:00.630 --> 03:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
will say the
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
staff that worked this issue uh as we
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
developed this budget request actually
 
03:59:06.790 --> 03:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
asked for even more than this to give
 
03:59:09.429 --> 03:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
you an idea uh you know that but but
 
03:59:11.189 --> 03:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes that that's
 
03:59:12.389 --> 03:59:12.399 align:start position:0%
certainly something we'd be willing to
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
do and can do
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know some of the challenges as
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're aware is
 
03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
as we
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
have developed these these uh online
 
03:59:24.550 --> 03:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
services for all our constituents uh
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's actually increased the demand for
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
it and as we look at
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to a more modern and certainly
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
more secure
 
03:59:34.630 --> 03:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh and more accessible uh
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
online tools
 
03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
and databases internally
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
we obviously have to maintain our
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
existing services also so it's kind of a
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
double whammy we have to keep what we're
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
doing while we're working on to to
 
03:59:49.110 --> 03:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
develop that uh so it's certainly a
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
challenge and certainly of great
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
interest to us to better serve our our
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
constituents in to be more efficient but
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
short answer uh mr chairs yes
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
a dollar amount
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
by which it wouldn't be scalable anymore
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
no that
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
you could continue on with with this
 
04:00:12.960 --> 04:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
you could continue on with with this
project

04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
um comfortable
 
04:00:18.150 --> 04:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
i know it's going to be whatever you say
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
but uh if we were to take out
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
two million four million
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand which kind of fall
 
04:00:25.760 --> 04:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand which kind of fall
apart

04:00:26.580 --> 04:00:26.590 align:start position:0%
apart
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
apart
[Music]

04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
which which one of my children do i love
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
best is that what you're saying um
 
04:00:34.229 --> 04:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know again we'll work with whatever
 
04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
whatever we can get but again uh
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
the original uh apps from staff is
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
actually hired to meet our needs
 
04:00:40.319 --> 04:00:41.189 align:start position:0%
actually hired to meet our needs
uh

04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
so you know as close as we can
 
04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
keep get to keeping where where our
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
request is obviously the happier would
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
be we will work with whatever the
 
04:00:53.189 --> 04:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh chooses to give us
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:00:59.910 --> 04:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner scott
 
04:01:04.150 --> 04:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
um i had uh thank you mr chairman um i
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with mr pelletier
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
about this he had made a phone call
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
and they referred me off to uh mr
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
taggart uh who i believe is in your

and

04:01:22.870 --> 04:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:24.950 --> 04:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
he permitted me to see one of the
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
modules that you're looking to move
 
04:01:27.040 --> 04:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
modules that you're looking to move
forward

04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
a great presentation modeled heavily off
 
04:01:31.279 --> 04:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
a great presentation modeled heavily off
this the

04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
this the
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
ever successful uh subsurface
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh model uh and i expressed to pelletier
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
mr pelletier
 
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh that i think you know we're somewhat
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
backwards but it is somewhat opinion
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we should do in wetlands
 
04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
before we do shoreland but i appreciate
 
04:01:52.229 --> 04:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
the step moving forward
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
so my question is when you're talking
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
about scalability that looks like mr
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
taggart and others have a great amount
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
of work in that program your youtube
 
04:02:01.359 --> 04:02:03.269 align:start position:0%
of work in that program your youtube
video

04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
video
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
and it would be a great help to a major
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
could that program move forward with
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
still working on some of the others at a
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.600 --> 04:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:21.030 --> 04:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
we'll take whatever the committee would
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
would give us the uh
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
the real issue is going to be the the
 
04:02:27.279 --> 04:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
the real issue is going to be the the
the

04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:31.590 --> 04:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
the one stop platform the the underlying
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
databases require uh mapping and work uh
 
04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's one of the problems with
 
04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
that uh so yes uh that's certainly a
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
priority for us and as you saw rep
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
given that that pilot if you will is
 
04:02:44.560 --> 04:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
given that that pilot if you will is
there

04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh our intention would be to move that
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
move that forward because a lot of the
 
04:02:50.950 --> 04:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
work and the mapping and all that has
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
been done done with that uh so
 
04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
yeah the question would the next
 
04:02:56.790 --> 04:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
question would if i were you i'd be
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
asking is when and i think we talked
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
about that last time uh the last capital
 
04:03:02.229 --> 04:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
budget is
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's a matter of resources and
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
i don't really have a good time frame
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
for that as i mentioned the uh and this
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
is not a knock yet uh commissioner
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
goulet i think it's the nature of the
 
04:03:14.080 --> 04:03:14.870 align:start position:0%
goulet i think it's the nature of the
work

04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i've i've never seen an i.t
 
04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
project come in on time at least in the
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
state government uh and and and while i
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
if i could uh to your question on the
 
04:03:24.720 --> 04:03:25.830 align:start position:0%
if i could uh to your question on the
wetlands

04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
program one of the concerns with the
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
wetlands program is every time the law
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
and or rules changes uh that would drive
 
04:03:35.830 --> 04:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's really helpful to get all that
 
04:03:37.830 --> 04:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
stabilized while we work on what the
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
platform would look up right so you have
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
the underlying law that is going to
 
04:03:41.840 --> 04:03:42.950 align:start position:0%
the underlying law that is going to
inform

04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
inform
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
what the user and what the staff need to
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
do in that database and in the user
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
platform and it's very helpful to have
 
04:03:50.630 --> 04:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more stabilized and
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's been a work in progress as you
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
know we're trying we've been trying to
 
04:03:56.150 --> 04:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh with the wetlands rules
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
to uh streamline those and and uh have a
 
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
fresh set of eyes on those so i don't
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.640 --> 04:04:05.429 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
um i i appreciate your comments and
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're out there looking
 
04:04:14.710 --> 04:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
for fresh eyes just give me a call on
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
wetlands thank you
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um mr chair and thank you
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming i mean as a
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
member of the oil fund disbursement
 
04:04:30.150 --> 04:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
board i saw firsthand how important it
 
04:04:32.150 --> 04:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
is that your systems are
 
04:04:34.790 --> 04:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
up and running and uh we you know it
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
took a while to process quite a few
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
requests because the system was broken
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
down and i fully support you keeping
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
everything up to snuff um there but one
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
thing i wanted to ask in particular is
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interest among some of
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
the members and i know people in the
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
seacoast for the coastal flooding
 
04:04:54.640 --> 04:04:55.750 align:start position:0%
seacoast for the coastal flooding
finance

04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
finance
 
04:04:55.760 --> 04:04:57.189 align:start position:0%
finance
and

04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
it just needs another 340 thousand
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
dollars to get it over the hump and i
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you what your feeling was
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
as far as um how that could work out
 
04:05:08.800 --> 04:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
as far as um how that could work out
between

04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:05:15.590 --> 04:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
your i.t budget and that appropriation
 
04:05:15.600 --> 04:05:16.389 align:start position:0%
your i.t budget and that appropriation
sure

04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
again that just for the rest of the
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh what that work would do for
 
04:05:22.469 --> 04:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
coastal uh
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
flooding model we have uh
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
the good news is we have newer data
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
lidar data this laser pulse data which
 
04:05:33.189 --> 04:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
is much more has a higher resolution uh
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
and we'd be able to couple that with uh
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
more up-to-date uh
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
predictive uh
 
04:05:39.920 --> 04:05:41.269 align:start position:0%
predictive uh
data

04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
data
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
and we think that would be a much better
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
useful tool for
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's designing uh
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
new projects or just uh helping for
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
resiliency on the on the the coastal
 
04:05:54.870 --> 04:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
flood plains so that's so that is very
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
04:05:56.319 --> 04:05:57.189 align:start position:0%
important to us
uh

04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:00.309 --> 04:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
whether you know again ideally uh
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know to be blunt the database work
 
04:06:02.239 --> 04:06:03.110 align:start position:0%
you know to be blunt the database work
again

04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:06:05.429 --> 04:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
we have more work uh as far as what's
 
04:06:07.670 --> 04:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
needed to go in and we were trying to be
 
04:06:09.429 --> 04:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
believe it or not austere in what we
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
if you could believe that uh so in my
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
ideal world we'd get both
 
04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh but uh certainly that that could come
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
out of that i would i would uh
 
04:06:23.189 --> 04:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
remind you my understanding is
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
is the you know we talked last friday
 
04:06:25.600 --> 04:06:26.630 align:start position:0%
is the you know we talked last friday
about

04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
repurposing lapse money
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh and to the extent what we asked for
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
would be approved which i i thought the
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee had had uh voted on that uh
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
that really means it's not 350 or 340 it
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be 189 would be the the delta if
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
you will uh
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
just to just to
 
04:06:45.279 --> 04:06:47.110 align:start position:0%
just to just to
this

04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.239 --> 04:06:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
you're right commissioner that the
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
approve using your lapse money for that
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
flood project
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i believe that
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
meeting last friday
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
we were informed that that was
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
usable and you could make do with that
 
04:07:17.189 --> 04:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
again it's you're probably going to say
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we were at this
 
04:07:25.840 --> 04:07:28.630 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we were at this
morning

04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:28.640 --> 04:07:30.750 align:start position:0%
 
really

04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner could you just speak one
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
more time briefly about how rapidly you
 
04:08:03.429 --> 04:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
think the pfas waste management projects
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
will be coming along
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i may ask sue carlson's uh to get
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
elevated to see if she can weigh in also
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
again uh so the as you have already
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
discussed and the treasurer mentioned so
 
04:08:17.110 --> 04:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
we had the uh
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
the bill passed last biennium for 50 50
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars of bonding
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh we had we promulgated administrative
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
rules on uh what we're calling the pfas
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh revolving loan fund uh and those are
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
in place and so that took a little bit
 
04:08:35.590 --> 04:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
of time to go through that process and
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding is we have two
 
04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh applications which i'm not sure even
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
perfected at this point so
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be a staging if you will as
 
04:08:44.560 --> 04:08:45.510 align:start position:0%
there'll be a staging if you will as
people

04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
decide they want to do that again these
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
are loans not grants so they they're
 
04:08:50.550 --> 04:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know what opportunities are
 
04:08:51.680 --> 04:08:52.710 align:start position:0%
you know what opportunities are
available

04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:08:55.110 --> 04:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i will say i think the intent of
 
04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
some of the sponsors certainly was uh
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
that applicants don't go to the drinking
 
04:09:01.110 --> 04:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund they go to
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
this loan fund instead but there's still
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
some some play in that because sometimes
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's multiple contaminants and
 
04:09:07.520 --> 04:09:08.229 align:start position:0%
there's multiple contaminants and
so

04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
i say that in the context is certainly
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
we don't envision in any capacity and
 
04:09:14.150 --> 04:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing it yet that there's
 
04:09:16.150 --> 04:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
going to be boom here's 50 million that
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
we need to fund
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to be dribbling in if you
 
04:09:23.189 --> 04:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
will and as understandably as the
 
04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
the people that have the need the
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
explore all their options obviously they
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
prefer to get uh a grant rather than
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay a loan and
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
when they do look at a loan obviously
 
04:09:35.830 --> 04:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
they need to look at where can i get the
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
best rate et cetera et cetera so i don't
 
04:09:40.150 --> 04:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for uh elevating uh our
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
chief operating officer susan carlson i
 
04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if she had anything else to
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:09:49.920 --> 04:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
to your question representative ebel
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
we're currently looking at
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
between three and four million dollars
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
in loan requests right now
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
we anticipate for 22
 
04:10:07.590 --> 04:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
um approximately 15 million dollars in
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
loans going out
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
and another 15 million going out and 23
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
and that's what we put in the operating
 
04:10:14.319 --> 04:10:15.269 align:start position:0%
and that's what we put in the operating
budget

04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
obviously that is highly dependent on
 
04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
the communities and how much
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
the pfas remediation will cost and how
 
04:10:24.790 --> 04:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
fast they can have their bond
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
authorizations approved through their
 
04:10:26.399 --> 04:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
authorizations approved through their
towns

04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner you're welcome to
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
stay on uh
 
04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
as an attendee and figure out what we're
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
doing to each other
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
with you well
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:56.000 --> 04:10:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%

good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%

may have
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
welcome commissioner
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
um there were a couple questions i'll
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
give you some good news first at least
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
100 good news
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh this morning as we were going through
 
04:11:46.800 --> 04:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
uh this morning as we were going through
um

04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
let's propose this capital budget
 
04:11:53.110 --> 04:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
we did
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
tentatively i say 10 weeks we haven't
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
taken final votes and added two projects
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:12:02.469 --> 04:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:12:06.630 --> 04:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're on your unfunded list as far as
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh doors at the at the men's prison and
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
for 200 000 and close customer unit for
 
04:12:13.600 --> 04:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
for 200 000 and close customer unit for
300

04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
300
 
04:12:15.840 --> 04:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
300
so

04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's the good news now the bad news is
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
people wanted to talk to you about
 
04:12:22.560 --> 04:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
people wanted to talk to you about
um

04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
tour lines and grinders and
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
those types of things and how how we're
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
handling all of that
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
670 000 is sufficient too much or just
 
04:12:38.479 --> 04:12:40.150 align:start position:0%
670 000 is sufficient too much or just
right

04:12:40.150 --> 04:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
chair i'd like to first thank you for
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
the tentative good news we'll take even
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
tentative good news and corrections that
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
helps keep us motivated to the job at
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
hand and happy to answer
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh questions regarding the
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
septic and
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
the two different projects proposed in
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
this capital outlay
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh mr chairman commissioner
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
and i and i i think we may be able i
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
think the question was coming from me
 
04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
on the grinder in the sewer line but i
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
think i was reminded afterwards
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
that this item if i could mr chairman
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
this line item 38 rebuild sewer line and
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
grinder this is the ongoing odyssey for
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
the project that's on the state prison
 
04:13:29.439 --> 04:13:30.710 align:start position:0%
the project that's on the state prison
grounds

04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
grounds
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir the one that's uh basically in
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
mcguire street yes that's correct and if
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
i could follow up
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the uh and i and i'm in favor of
 
04:13:41.110 --> 04:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
that so we don't need to discuss in my
 
04:13:44.309 --> 04:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
mind that uh my question was on another
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
one of your want lists which was talking
 
04:13:46.720 --> 04:13:48.389 align:start position:0%
one of your want lists which was talking
about

04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
and off property uh of yours it was the
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
discussion was whether a grinder pump to
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
connect to the town
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh to the city sewer system or to put a
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
04:14:00.239 --> 04:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
septic system
but

04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
that so far is not funded anyway so
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i and i'm hoping you'll look at what
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
the alternatives really are and the cost
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the long term but i don't think we
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
need to take committee time to discuss
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
that any further mr mr chair
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and um we're recognizing
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
that as a
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
off-funded uh topic we'll send you some
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
information if it serves the committee
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
we'll send it to the whole committee of
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
the analysis done to date and we'll
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
continue to do further analysis on that
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
project thank you thank you commissioner
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman very welcome sir
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner um i realize that this
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
isn't in the governor's part of the
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
budget but i am
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
curious because we've invested quite a
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
bit of money in the women's prison if
 
04:14:53.110 --> 04:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
you could
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
talk to us a little bit more about the
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
350 000 building that you had proposed
 
04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
for trades one of the reasons that uh
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
the women's prison had to be built was
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
to try to equalize programming between
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
the men's and the women's prison
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
i gather that we're not all the way
 
04:15:16.149 --> 04:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
there yet
 
04:15:17.830 --> 04:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
04:15:19.349 --> 04:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of things i just
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you again about that
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
building but also to refresh our
 
04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
recollection about independent
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
fundraising there had been done
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
related to those programs
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative abel
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
and your history on the department and
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
litigation is spot on uh yes
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
historically we were litigated at the
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
men's uh facil men's facility
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
specifically but
 
04:15:45.750 --> 04:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
around education and vocation and now
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
we're currently working with new
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire legal assistants under
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
oversight regarding equity and
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
programming for women
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
so the proposed
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh building and i'll defer to john to
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
talk about the style of building was to
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
implement a trade school so we could
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
have equity from the perspective that we
 
04:16:06.870 --> 04:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a diverse industries program
 
04:16:08.149 --> 04:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
offered to men
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
automotive print shop
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
furniture masters and things of that
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
nature the current uh facility that was
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
designed does not have capacity through
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
our hvac system to put those type of
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
services in the existing structure so we
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
worked on a project with some partners
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
to try to find a space on the property
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
that would allow for
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
this type of trade school and education
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
and job skills building for women to
 
04:16:40.790 --> 04:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
establish that equity the fundraising
 
04:16:44.070 --> 04:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
you referenced was done and and i had a
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
retired member of the department who was
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
the liaison for that
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
that fundraising was specifically for
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
the equipment that would go into the
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
building so this request from the
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
department was to build the
 
04:16:55.520 --> 04:16:56.710 align:start position:0%
department was to build the
infrastructure

04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
and our collaborator was working on the
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
donations to outfit the interior if you
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
will the ff e that would go into the
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
building in that type of partnership so
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'd ask john just to describe this
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
building because we were not building it
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
um in a corrections grade form not
 
04:17:13.439 --> 04:17:14.389 align:start position:0%
um in a corrections grade form not
cement

04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
cement
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
because people aren't living there but
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
to create a space that was reasonable
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
within the construction realm to bring
 
04:17:22.950 --> 04:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
the costs down but also achieve the goal
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right commissioner so we
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
were looking at a pitched roof type
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
building within the footprint of the
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
existing uh women's prison campus
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
would be behind the secure fencing if
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
you will
 
04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that that building would have a
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
multitude of things in there including
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
the wood masters group as well as some
 
04:17:43.110 --> 04:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
vocational um areas to train some of the
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
residents on plumbing hvac and those
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
types of things so it's a standard
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
building it would look a little more
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
aesthetically pleasing sort of like as
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
you would call the c2 building with a
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
pitched roof and it would actually be
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
close to that there's a spot that we
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
selected for this not a huge building
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
but it would be an additional building
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
so i would just say then um
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
from i gather from what you're saying
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
04:18:19.910 --> 04:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
part of the continuing path to com fully
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
complying with the court order on the
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
women's prison
 
04:18:24.080 --> 04:18:25.030 align:start position:0%
women's prison
representative

04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
we're not in a court order
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
however you want to just i want to be
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
careful is that certainly another one of
 
04:18:31.199 --> 04:18:34.950 align:start position:0%
careful is that certainly another one of
those

04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
no it's no problem
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh it is certainly a process we're
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
engaged in with new hampshire legal
 
04:18:43.269 --> 04:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
assistance to review the education and
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
vocational program to make sure that we
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
have the an equitable depth of offerings
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
this was a logical opportunity to
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
diversify the job skill sets that we
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
would teach women who are incarcerated
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
and it would be establishing a level of
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
equity with regard to what we offer to
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
men so at this time i think just so the
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
committee knows we offer a cosmetology
 
04:19:04.479 --> 04:19:05.590 align:start position:0%
committee knows we offer a cosmetology
program

04:19:05.590 --> 04:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
a commissary program that is basically
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
modeled after manufacturing we have a um
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
a braille transcription program that is
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
not uh turned into the robust program i
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
had hoped it had be
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be in some other programs but we
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the depth of what i would
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
call as a as a woman the sort of
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
non-traditional jobs um that should be
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
traditional jobs that are offered to
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
women because of the wages associated
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
with them upon release to help help that
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
reintegration process and this seemed
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
like a a good investment to try to move
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
those initiatives forward
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
one question on
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
any of your
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
projects that
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
you had listed as not as proposed but
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
not included including the government
 
04:19:58.399 --> 04:20:00.229 align:start position:0%
not included including the government
who

04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
did the estimating crime
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
on those uh like that built into this
 
04:20:05.680 --> 04:20:07.830 align:start position:0%
on those uh like that built into this
discussion

04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:20:09.990 --> 04:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
i can answer that so um
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
we start out with our own internal
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
estimate within the department of
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
corrections and then public works loans
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
us project managers and we review them
 
04:20:18.080 --> 04:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
us project managers and we review them
together

04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
in some cases uh we're high and they're
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
low and vice verse
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
but uh it is a combined effort between
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
the two agencies
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay even for the ones that
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
that like what we're discussing right
 
04:20:31.279 --> 04:20:33.830 align:start position:0%
that like what we're discussing right
now

04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
yes we we actually did estimating some
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
with a finer pencil than others but on
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
18 projects
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%

what
is

04:21:24.389 --> 04:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:21:24.399 --> 04:21:25.750 align:start position:0%
is
um

04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
again some good news maybe bad news
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.110 --> 04:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
the demolition of the wilkins building
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
at uh sununu center
 
04:22:07.520 --> 04:22:09.189 align:start position:0%
at uh sununu center
um

04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
when i finish talking if you can just
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
give us
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
another brief description of what that
 
04:22:16.149 --> 04:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
is why it
 
04:22:19.269 --> 04:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be demolished and also we're
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
a boiler at the barn at the community
 
04:22:25.600 --> 04:22:27.189 align:start position:0%
a boiler at the barn at the community
center

04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
center
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
but then it's all wrapped into
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.239 --> 04:22:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:35.110 --> 04:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's all one question correct
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
it's all one question
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
i i will do my best i believe i have so
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
i have mr clap on the line as well who
 
04:22:44.479 --> 04:22:48.630 align:start position:0%
i have mr clap on the line as well who
uh

04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
dave klapp could speak to the specifics
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the buildings i know that wilkins
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
building has been closed for quite some
 
04:22:54.880 --> 04:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
building has been closed for quite some
time

04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
um it was vandalized i believe there was
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
also a fire there so i believe that the
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
building is compromised itself and we
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
have safety fence around it
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
but it still is a huge liability for
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
that campus for anyone trespassing on
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
that campus
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
so we i think this is not the first
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
capital request that we've had uh for to
 
04:23:20.710 --> 04:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
demo that building
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
dave is did i miss anything on the
 
04:23:22.399 --> 04:23:23.670 align:start position:0%
dave is did i miss anything on the
wilkins

04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
wilkins
 
04:23:26.710 --> 04:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
no you are correct it was um
 
04:23:26.720 --> 04:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
no you are correct it was um
when

04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
heaven found out exactly how the fire
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
started it was believed that it was a
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
homeless person in there and started the
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
fire and it did severely damage it was
 
04:23:40.229 --> 04:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed by historical resources
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
and they have agreed so long as we
 
04:23:42.560 --> 04:23:43.750 align:start position:0%
and they have agreed so long as we
retain

04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
retain
 
04:23:46.389 --> 04:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
some pieces of the building
 
04:23:46.399 --> 04:23:48.870 align:start position:0%
some pieces of the building
to

04:23:48.870 --> 04:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes um the
 
04:24:10.560 --> 04:24:12.790 align:start position:0%
yes um the
barn

04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
barn
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
boiler has failed uh we've done a
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
temporary work around right at this
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
point but it does need to be replaced
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
the bond is used for storage of
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
groundskeeping equipment some vehicles
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
that are in use at sununu and
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
um some other items uh
 
04:24:32.479 --> 04:24:33.429 align:start position:0%
um some other items uh
pro

04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
pro
 
04:24:48.149 --> 04:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
so um just a couple questions mr
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
so you're saying i unfortunately i can't
 
04:24:58.229 --> 04:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
find the uh dhhs proposal right now but
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
my recollection of the boiler was that
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was to support heat not just
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
for a barn but for some other
 
04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:08.389 align:start position:0%
for a barn but for some other
external

04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
external
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
buildings external to the center i just
 
04:25:13.110 --> 04:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to put a boiler in a building
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
that's already collapsed you know you
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
know what i'm saying
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes i do know what you're saying i've
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
been told that it does support uh two
 
04:25:24.550 --> 04:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
other buildings that are on this on the
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
campus right now
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
besides itself
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get a hold of the
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
maintenance person down there to verify
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
which buildings they are because they
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
had a feeling you would be asking that
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
and do you think that the hundred
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
thousand is a solid number or do you
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
still have to work with public works on
 
04:25:41.920 --> 04:25:43.269 align:start position:0%
still have to work with public works on
that

04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have to work with public works on
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
it but i think it's a pretty good number
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
for what we need
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay and then i had one more follow-up
 
04:25:50.720 --> 04:25:51.510 align:start position:0%
okay and then i had one more follow-up
um

04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know we were up at glencliff and we
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
saw a lot of things that needed
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
assistance but one of your requests had
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
to do with the septic system up there
 
04:26:01.520 --> 04:26:02.389 align:start position:0%
to do with the septic system up there
and

04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
one question i had
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
had to do with
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of engineering for it even if
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
we can't finance the entire thing if we
 
04:26:14.830 --> 04:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
were able to put together some money for
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
engineering a would that be helpful and
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
b do you have a rough idea of what that
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the estimate that we put together
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
was also tied into
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
the addition
 
04:26:30.070 --> 04:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
that was slated for up there so we have
 
04:26:32.790 --> 04:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
a pretty good number on uh idea on the
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
number to do the repairs
 
04:26:37.750 --> 04:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh we could do some engineering up front
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
that would be quite helpful i don't have
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
the full number on that i'd have to work
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
with public works to try to get a hard
 
04:26:47.349 --> 04:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
represent thompson
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner or mr clap whoever wants
 
04:26:54.070 --> 04:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
to take the question
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
on the wilkins building
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
has there been an environmental
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
assessment done on that as far as
 
04:26:59.199 --> 04:27:02.309 align:start position:0%
assessment done on that as far as
asbestos

04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:02.319 --> 04:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
if not is that if so
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
is that included in the 750
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
04:27:10.319 --> 04:27:12.950 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
estimate

04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
that is included in the 750 000
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
estimate to do the full demolition we do
 
04:27:22.229 --> 04:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
know that there is lead paint and
 
04:27:25.110 --> 04:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
there i believe there was an assessment
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
done on the building before and i
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
from hhs
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
now the the big question because we're
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
talking about the barn and the wilkens
 
04:27:44.399 --> 04:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
talking about the barn and the wilkens
and

04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
other things
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
what is
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
how does the department view the
 
04:27:52.950 --> 04:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
long-term future
 
04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the communities that it may not be
 
04:27:58.389 --> 04:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
for you that's your class but
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
our commissioner but it would be helpful
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
if you can get it
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
are we raising money putting any money
 
04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
into any of these buildings if we're
 
04:28:09.110 --> 04:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question i mean i
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
think it's a reasonable question to ask
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
are you going to be investing in a
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
property that we're no longer going to
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
be using and i can tell you this that
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
there will
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's the question that seems to
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
be on every committee of what is the
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
future of the suny news center but when
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
it relates to the the campus and the
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
needs there we currently have kids there
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to have kids there
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
for the foreseeable future we are in the
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
process of building up a system of care
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
which we're about a year and a half into
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
that we're about to launch some new
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
programming which that is going to have
 
04:28:44.710 --> 04:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
an impact on the numbers for sunday new
 
04:28:46.790 --> 04:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to cause the sununu
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
center to not have a need unfortunately
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
we we have a population that commits
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
violent crimes that that that that
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
require that level
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
of care so at this time they're in the
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future we're going to still
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
be on that campus now when the system of
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
care gets set up that's going to inform
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
us well what kind of facility do we need
 
04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of size do we need a facility
 
04:29:10.469 --> 04:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
that big i can't answer that i can't
 
04:29:12.149 --> 04:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
predict the future but i can tell you
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
that based on some of the designs that
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
there will still be a need for this
 
04:29:18.710 --> 04:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
level of service but how that all plays
 
04:29:20.790 --> 04:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
out is is sort of
 
04:29:22.790 --> 04:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
going to come together in
 
04:29:22.800 --> 04:29:26.790 align:start position:0%
going to come together in
time

04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if i could return
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
to the conversation
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
on glencliff commissioner with the other
 
04:29:35.590 --> 04:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
gentleman there
 
04:29:35.600 --> 04:29:36.469 align:start position:0%
gentleman there
the

04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative had asked a question
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
about the uh engineering for
 
04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh what we thought was just a septic
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
system but it seems like you're saying
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
that that project also involves a
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
building i guess my question is
 
04:29:51.600 --> 04:29:52.550 align:start position:0%
building i guess my question is
is

04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
is this more than just a septic field is
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
this a is this a waste processing and
 
04:29:57.920 --> 04:29:58.710 align:start position:0%
this a is this a waste processing and
that

04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
that building that you're talking about
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh no the
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
what i was
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
stating is we were looking at an
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
addition it was a project that was
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
submitted and not considered
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
and but as part of that we had built in
 
04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
upgrade for the septic system so the
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
the design
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
it has already been looked at we don't
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:30:33.910 --> 04:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
dollar value on the design work
 
04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
but we do know that the
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
the value of the septic system
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
is that 1.2 million i believe it is
 
04:30:43.359 --> 04:30:44.550 align:start position:0%
is that 1.2 million i believe it is
um

04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the the system and it is only for
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
the system it's not for the building
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
04:30:55.110 --> 04:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
yes at this um
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
04:30:59.279 --> 04:31:00.309 align:start position:0%
representative abel
um

04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
well i guess i would ask the i.t
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
question again there's um i mean i think
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
we have a sense that we're not gonna
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
do too much with the hhsit request
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
because so much of it is federally
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
funded but
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
again um just you know a hundred
 
04:31:19.830 --> 04:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars can buy a boiler versus
 
04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 million so
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if there was any
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
comment anybody could make on
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
scalability for any of the programs or
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
how they would be affected
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question i
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if dennis is still on the
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
line however i think i think
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet summed it up pretty
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
well in terms of that there was a dry
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
spell for hhs for quite some time and
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
we're behind and as you know a lot of
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
compliance and facing fines
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know that said i mean is there room
 
04:31:53.269 --> 04:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
to look at something to see where we can
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
do that i think the complexity for a lot
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
of our projects is once you tap into
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
that you have to tap in to get enough of
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
a general fund return given the high
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of the 90
 
04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
federal match
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
so if that was a request that's
 
04:32:09.510 --> 04:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
something that we could look into but i
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
i think when dennis looks and talks
 
04:32:12.319 --> 04:32:13.189 align:start position:0%
i think when dennis looks and talks
about

04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh the the impact of it in terms of the
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
serving the citizens and he had two
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
metrics that he used those are things
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we await with him in terms of
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
making these projects a priority and of
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
course the capital budget is very
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
challenging because everybody's project
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
is a priority right and your committee's
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
job is very
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
next to impossible to do i completely
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
understand that but if we if he wanted
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
us to ask us to do that we could i just
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what the outcome would be if
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
we would actually be able to do that i
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
don't have dave leaders on the phone um
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
to answer that but
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
see you none commissioner thank you very
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
much for taking the time to be with us
 
04:33:00.880 --> 04:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
much for taking the time to be with us
this

04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:09.680 --> 04:33:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:26.400 --> 04:33:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
we've gone through everything
 
04:33:33.600 --> 04:33:34.869 align:start position:0%
we've gone through everything
um

04:33:34.869 --> 04:33:34.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
before we go back through a couple of
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
the things
 
04:33:42.150 --> 04:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
there are two things that we need to
 
04:33:42.160 --> 04:33:44.470 align:start position:0%
there are two things that we need to
address

04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:33:44.480 --> 04:33:46.789 align:start position:0%
address
and

04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
we retained two separate house bills
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
in order to see
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
if the monies could be incorporated into
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
 
04:33:58.920 --> 04:34:00.629 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
595

04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
595
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh for the digitization
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
of the supreme court records
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
there is a capital appropriation that
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
would be associated with it i would
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
remind everybody
 
04:34:27.039 --> 04:34:27.830 align:start position:0%
remind everybody
that

04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
neither the judicial branch nor das who
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
were involved in this
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
um wanted to take on the project as
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
as shepherding the project
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
in my contact with the archive the state
 
04:34:43.279 --> 04:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
in my contact with the archive the state
archives

04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
archives
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted a lot more information and
 
04:34:46.480 --> 04:34:48.551 align:start position:0%
they wanted a lot more information and
data

04:34:48.551 --> 04:34:48.561 align:start position:0%
data
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
before they would agree to take it on as
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
well and they're not sure about the cost
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.561 --> 04:34:59.429 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
we did retain it to say that we would
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
look at it in conjunction with the
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do anything
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation to the house
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
but from
 
04:35:19.269 --> 04:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
past experience
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
if we don't include into the capital
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
budget most
 
04:35:24.869 --> 04:35:24.879 align:start position:0%
members of the committee don't want to
 
04:35:27.510 --> 04:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
entertain capital projects outside the
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
capital budget except for very rare
 
04:35:30.320 --> 04:35:33.029 align:start position:0%
capital budget except for very rare
instances

04:35:33.029 --> 04:35:33.039 align:start position:0%
instances
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
so when is the pleasure of the committee
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.840 --> 04:35:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:35:40.639 --> 04:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
this
representative

04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
i believe i made the
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
original motion to retain it for this
 
04:35:46.400 --> 04:35:47.429 align:start position:0%
original motion to retain it for this
purpose

04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
and as such and having worked through
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
this capital budget and seeing how tight
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
our pennies are
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh at this point in time i would be
 
04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
willing to just let it stay retained and
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
we can look at it
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
next time
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
next year and
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
there's always the same side there's
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
still the center side so i i would just
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
say at this point in time we don't look
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
to put any money towards it
 
04:36:12.400 --> 04:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
to put any money towards it
other

04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have the bill in front of me how
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
much money are you talking about
 
04:36:19.840 --> 04:36:21.269 align:start position:0%
much money are you talking about
um

04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
it was nine years
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
um i've got it here
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh fy 22 250 000 fy23
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
500 so 750 for this biennium and then
 
04:36:35.349 --> 04:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
one point
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
two plus
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
so it's a multivitamin it's a
 
04:36:42.959 --> 04:36:44.551 align:start position:0%
so it's a multivitamin it's a
multi-biennium

04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
multi-biennium
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
and 750 up front
 
04:36:47.199 --> 04:36:48.150 align:start position:0%
and 750 up front
okay

04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah i i i don't know i
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
tend to think it maybe just to keep it
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
retained for now unless the senate puts
 
04:36:58.830 --> 04:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
it in there version i
 
04:36:58.840 --> 04:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
it in there version i
suppose

04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will go to the communities
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
of conference this year
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
um when we get to those things but our
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
goal right now is to come up with a hb
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
25 that we can get passed to the second
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
the second bill
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
we retained
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
um i was prime sponsor
 
04:37:35.920 --> 04:37:36.709 align:start position:0%
um i was prime sponsor
um

04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
that does not make it right um it is an
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
act making
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
the federal stafford county straight
 
04:37:43.359 --> 04:37:44.789 align:start position:0%
the federal stafford county straight
rail

04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
rail
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
improvements project and making an
 
04:37:49.590 --> 04:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the crews county
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
freight rail improvement project
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
rail lines that the
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
original bill requested 2 million
 
04:37:59.359 --> 04:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
original bill requested 2 million
each

04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
each
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be matched
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
by an equal amount from those two
 
04:38:04.561 --> 04:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
by an equal amount from those two
railroads

04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
railroads
 
04:38:09.429 --> 04:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
we retained it to see if there could be
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
any monies
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
appropriated for
 
04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
a match to those railroads
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
speaking as the prime sponsor and not as
 
04:38:22.000 --> 04:38:23.429 align:start position:0%
speaking as the prime sponsor and not as
chair

04:38:23.429 --> 04:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
the past we have provided some funds
 
04:38:28.949 --> 04:38:28.959 align:start position:0%
never what they asked for
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
and they have made their
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
matches on time
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
and they have reported to the capitol
 
04:38:37.269 --> 04:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
budget overview committee when they were
 
04:38:37.279 --> 04:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
budget overview committee when they were
supposed

04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
supposed
 
04:38:38.400 --> 04:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
supposed
however

04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:38:43.269 --> 04:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
as we've been talking all day
 
04:38:45.189 --> 04:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
this is a tight budget
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
04:38:48.959 --> 04:38:50.869 align:start position:0%
what is the
committee's

04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
04:38:50.879 --> 04:38:54.869 align:start position:0%
committee's
desire

04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i i agree with what the chairman had
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
just spoken about that we have provided
 
04:39:14.789 --> 04:39:14.799 align:start position:0%
some funding for both of these railroads
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
over the past and they've been very
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
upfront with the money spent and they've
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
done their projects so i know these
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
numbers are nowhere near what we're
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
asked for originally
 
04:39:25.439 --> 04:39:27.029 align:start position:0%
asked for originally
and

04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:27.039 --> 04:39:27.830 align:start position:0%
and
i

04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
still haven't narrowed down which of the
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
two railroads it is but i believe in
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:38.070 --> 04:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay which was the
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
250 000 proposal
 
04:39:43.990 --> 04:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh so uh the project the chairman had
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
just mentioned
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh i would look to add 250 000
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
to the capital budget
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the second would be the
 
04:39:55.600 --> 04:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
and the second would be the
cost

04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
the coast county
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
increased by 500 000. it's not a lot of
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
money but i
 
04:40:07.110 --> 04:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think it stands
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh with what this uh committee has done
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
in the past and shows a willingness to
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
keep our rail projects especially
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
freight moving forward i will second
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
that motion
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
consecutive that
 
04:40:20.320 --> 04:40:23.110 align:start position:0%
consecutive that
um

04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
that will incorporate some
 
04:40:25.280 --> 04:40:26.390 align:start position:0%
that will incorporate some
of

04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:28.670 --> 04:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
the language from house
 
04:40:31.030 --> 04:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
120 122
 
04:40:31.040 --> 04:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
120 122
um

04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:32.000 --> 04:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
um
for

04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
line in the south and
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
to the coast county freight lines for a
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
total of
 
04:40:50.230 --> 04:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
750 000 between the two of them there
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
which responds generally with the caveat
 
04:40:53.200 --> 04:40:54.070 align:start position:0%
which responds generally with the caveat
that

04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
ah thank you i have located where this
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
is in the 2019
 
04:41:11.190 --> 04:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
hospital 25 they are blind items
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
in department of transportation general
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
which is roman 16 xbi
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
so there are two letters one item for
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
koss and elena for strafford and carol
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh they have a footnote
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
that says that the sums appropriated
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
shall be a match to private funds and
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
that they have to report the capital
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
budget overview so
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
i would guess the motion should be that
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
appropriations or funding and move
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
forward it is not
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
um i know the one that goes
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
they got the full two million dollars
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
they could complete the project
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
but to come up with another 1.5
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget is
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
near impossible
 
04:42:12.160 --> 04:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
near impossible
um

04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
as we look at all of
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
the things that state owns that need to
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
continue forward
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
but as i said when i introduced these
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
bills both of these railroads keep
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of large
 
04:42:31.350 --> 04:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
trucks off of our work
 
04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
year round so that's
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
it is a wonderful goal representative
 
04:42:36.480 --> 04:42:37.990 align:start position:0%
it is a wonderful goal representative
evil

04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
evil
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
04:42:40.320 --> 04:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i just wanted to
clarify

04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
this amount that you're proposing now
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
is the amount that we
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
did a straw poll on from your sheet
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
earlier today it's the same amount
 
04:42:52.798 --> 04:42:55.750 align:start position:0%
earlier today it's the same amount
um

04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay but it's it's what's on here all
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
right we stopped for lunch at that point
 
04:43:03.280 --> 04:43:06.310 align:start position:0%
right we stopped for lunch at that point
oh

04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
i ate too much tuna
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to reiterate for this
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
brother you were members of the
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
committee and you just you just said it
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh part of the reason that we do this in
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
this committee is because these trains
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
do help keep all that truck traffic off
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
the road and we're having you know we
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
have enough time truck tough time with
 
04:43:26.160 --> 04:43:26.868 align:start position:0%
have enough time truck tough time with
our

04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
pavement resurfacing yes it is anyway so
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
this has always been money well spent
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
inspect here
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments about
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
i gotta say i kind of fundamentally
 
04:43:53.430 --> 04:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
disagree with this
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
idea of subsidizing a private company
 
04:43:56.480 --> 04:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
idea of subsidizing a private company
and

04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
two things when
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
with this testimony i remember asking uh
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
about how they verified the match on
 
04:44:05.920 --> 04:44:06.788 align:start position:0%
about how they verified the match on
that

04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the fellow said that they pay for
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
this all up front and they get then get
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
the money from the state
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
which makes you wonder
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
why do they need our money you know they
 
04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
have enough to pay for that
 
04:44:19.830 --> 04:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the other thing
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
i'm involved with trucking and when you
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
say 37 or it was said 37 000 trucks uh
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
trips per year with trucks
 
04:44:34.230 --> 04:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
well if you went down to the hampton
 
04:44:34.240 --> 04:44:35.270 align:start position:0%
well if you went down to the hampton
tolls

04:44:35.270 --> 04:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
and sat down here
 
04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
i bet that's about maybe a day's worth
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
of trucks if that there so it sounds
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
like a very large number but i think i
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's as impressive as i
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
would think but at any rate i'm a new
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
guy here
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's just my impression and um i will
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i just
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
with all due respect i think this is an
 
04:45:05.280 --> 04:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
with all due respect i think this is an
issue

04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:45:08.310 --> 04:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
not so much in this budget but constant
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
complaints about heavy trucks damaging
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
our roads like whatever we could do
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
within reasons as long as the companies
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to match or exceed it to get put
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
more of the freight in rail which is a
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
lot better way to
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
do it this is a public what we call a
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
public private partnership we do these
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not in paper
 
04:45:34.240 --> 04:45:35.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not in paper
um

04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i the reason i'm not and i don't
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
know how many of you have read it but
 
04:45:40.948 --> 04:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
the last
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
i think in 2010
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time it indicated
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
that less than one percent of the
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
freight carried through
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
and into the state of new hampshire
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
um goes by rail
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
and when that report was written they
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
were basing that on
 
04:46:03.360 --> 04:46:04.470 align:start position:0%
were basing that on
a

04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
large quantity of that uh traffic came
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
from the paper mills in the berlin area
 
04:46:13.350 --> 04:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
which no longer exists maryland groved
 
04:46:13.360 --> 04:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
which no longer exists maryland groved
um

04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:17.430 --> 04:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
and 70 of the rail traffic in and out of
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
the state is the 100 train
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
coal cars that go to the vol power plant
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
on a weekly basis
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
that amounts to 70
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the 1 handled by ram
 
04:46:30.240 --> 04:46:31.510 align:start position:0%
of the 1 handled by ram
so

04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're subsidizing a private company
 
04:46:40.080 --> 04:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
we're subsidizing a private company
and

04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
my experience in the north country and i
 
04:46:45.670 --> 04:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
don't know about the rest of the state
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
but in the north country the saint
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
lawrence railway
 
04:46:52.550 --> 04:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
takes railcars through there about twice
 
04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
a week
 
04:46:56.070 --> 04:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
and they come from maine
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
they go to vermont and into canada
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
and they never drop any freight in the
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire or to the best of
 
04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
my knowledge pick any trade up in the
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire it's a
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
pass-through rail system
 
04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting against it as well
 
04:47:11.600 --> 04:47:13.830 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting against it as well
okay

04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just one final one uh
 
04:47:22.948 --> 04:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
because both the gentlemen are nuanced
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
to me it's been a number of years since
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
this actually came up uh this has come
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
up before and in the past we've had the
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
and we don't have the luxury of having
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
them with us today we did not anticipate
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
this question would come up but these
 
04:47:41.110 --> 04:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
two rail lines the money that we put
 
04:47:42.830 --> 04:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
towards them are
 
04:47:46.150 --> 04:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
specifically geared to transportation
 
04:47:47.830 --> 04:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire this isn't passed
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
through this one one was a route
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually up into
 
04:47:52.000 --> 04:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
actually up into
uh

04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkie's area i think
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
it was hauling gravel or something up
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
there so
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
this this money has always been for
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
interest interstate not interested
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%

04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay sorry i couldn't unmute it but i
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%

this morning

having heard

and the reason i'm doing this
is

04:50:22.550 --> 04:50:22.560 align:start position:0%

and
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
a meeting like this makes it a little
 
04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
more difficult to get with the lba and
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
the rest
 
04:50:39.200 --> 04:50:40.470 align:start position:0%

go ahead and add it
 
04:51:40.470 --> 04:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
as we go forward at least on this

04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
any comments on that
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
um mr shea
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't have a comment to that
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
specifically represent graham but i was
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
wondering if as you go through
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
if you added a project
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
in house bill 25 but also added a piece
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
of it into the
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh repurposing amount if you could just
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
i can go over i can send you a complete
 
04:52:28.080 --> 04:52:28.948 align:start position:0%
i can go over i can send you a complete
list

04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
then that's fine that way chris
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
and trying to do it here let that in
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
front of me and representative mills but
 
04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
well if you can send me something after
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
today that that would or after the
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
meeting that would be great and i can
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
um representative jack thank you i'd
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
love to uh if we need a motion i'd like
 
04:53:00.550 --> 04:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
to empower the chairman and mr shay
 
04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
to go back over the decisions we made
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
about where the last money is going
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
so that they can do it the simplest way
 
04:53:10.550 --> 04:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
rather than do it the way we voted on
 
04:53:10.560 --> 04:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
rather than do it the way we voted on
them

04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:20.550 --> 04:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna happen anyway
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll take that and mr
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
shea and i will work on it and provide
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
it to the committee on where the money
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
is coming from
 
04:53:36.070 --> 04:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
i don't want to try to do this in a
 
04:53:37.750 --> 04:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
vacuum even though it seems like i've
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
been loving this railroad all day
 
04:53:40.080 --> 04:53:43.510 align:start position:0%
been loving this railroad all day
um

04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.230 --> 04:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
from zambibo
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're back on the des uh budget
 
04:53:49.920 --> 04:53:52.070 align:start position:0%
um so we're back on the des uh budget
um

04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:54.788 --> 04:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
so i i looked this up when to in order
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
to get the 350 000 for the coastal
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
flooding we need 188 i'm sorry if i had
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
the number wrong before
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
there's two ways i guess that we could
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
do that i mean this is something that i
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss with the committee
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's two ways we could do it one is
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
to simply reduce the one one-stop i.t
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
budget by 108 and put it toward
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
the coastal the other option is that in
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
the past we've given committees some i
 
04:54:26.718 --> 04:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
the past we've given committees some i
mean

04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
department some latitude to move money
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
back and forth and so one other thing we
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
could do without hitting the bottom line
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
is just to give des the option
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
to use some of the i.t money for the
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
coastal flooding if that was something
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
that they
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
felt that they
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
could do and
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
again this wouldn't hit our bottom line
 
04:54:53.670 --> 04:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
it would accomplish uh things that or
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
help to accomplish some of the things
 
04:54:56.390 --> 04:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
that our
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
coastal folks uh are interested in doing
 
04:55:02.550 --> 04:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
that clearly is another economic engine
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
04:55:06.550 --> 04:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the state and i also took what
 
04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative thompson had said to hart
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
about all the work that's been done down
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
there so
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the committee's
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
pleasure is but um i would propose doing
 
04:55:21.910 --> 04:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and if i could
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
address representative eagle
 
04:55:27.120 --> 04:55:27.990 align:start position:0%
address representative eagle
um

04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:29.590 --> 04:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
but my first question is for you mr
 
04:55:32.150 --> 04:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
chairman had hadn't we penciled in this
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
morning a number of somewhere around 160
 
04:55:34.958 --> 04:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
morning a number of somewhere around 160
2016

04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
2016
 
04:55:37.680 --> 04:55:38.708 align:start position:0%
2016
yes

04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:55:38.718 --> 04:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
yes
it's

04:55:47.700 --> 04:55:47.710 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.710 --> 04:55:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:55:53.190 --> 04:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
i if i could mr chairman continue
 
04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
i i'm in i am um having not spoken much
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of this i'm more than willing
 
04:56:04.110 --> 04:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
to go forward with the
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
164 thousand dollar figure
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
um what wherever that number was we
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
penciled in this morning
 
04:56:14.868 --> 04:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner talked about
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
that they'll spend what they can and
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
that is so close to that number
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
um my second my second is on the uh
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
the five million dollars for the one
 
04:56:25.840 --> 04:56:27.110 align:start position:0%
the five million dollars for the one
stop

04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
stop
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
i've had time to reflect on that
 
04:56:33.430 --> 04:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not so much in taking away the money
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
from that because i believe it's a
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
needed program
 
04:56:39.670 --> 04:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
what i ask the chairman to do
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
is i'm wondering if we could footnote
 
04:56:42.798 --> 04:56:43.750 align:start position:0%
is i'm wondering if we could footnote
that

04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
or make that appropriation a lot of
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
times they have to spend a lot of that
 
04:56:50.550 --> 04:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
money up front is my understanding i'm
 
04:56:52.230 --> 04:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
not as well versed as representative
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
jack about that but i would like to see
 
04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
them report to a
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview when they hit
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
the three million dollar figure
 
04:57:05.190 --> 04:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
on progress made with that and the
 
04:57:05.200 --> 04:57:06.470 align:start position:0%
on progress made with that and the
modules

04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
modules
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:57:10.070 --> 04:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
that they will report to us going
 
04:57:10.080 --> 04:57:11.110 align:start position:0%
that they will report to us going
forward

04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
every time they spend a million dollars
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that we're going to be
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
in their way but i think when we're
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
spending five million dollars i think
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
the proper vehicle is oversight with
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview so i would be in
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
favor of keeping that that appropriation
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i would uh
 
04:57:32.788 --> 04:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
and i would uh
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
not be in favor of going from the 160
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
something to 180
 
04:57:43.110 --> 04:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
my feeling is uh
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
in and i use the one step system on a
 
04:57:52.948 --> 04:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:52.958 --> 04:57:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
as far as subsurface goes i think it's
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
working well now
 
04:58:01.110 --> 04:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
better than it ever has um
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
promises have been made over the years
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
as installers and designers that
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
there were going to be functions that
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.840 --> 04:58:14.868 align:start position:0%
 
system

04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:58:16.948 --> 04:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's never repaired
 
04:58:16.958 --> 04:58:18.310 align:start position:0%
that's never repaired
um

04:58:18.310 --> 04:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:18.320 --> 04:58:20.230 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:58:20.230 --> 04:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think five million dollars is a lot of
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
money to give them
 
04:58:24.000 --> 04:58:26.830 align:start position:0%
money to give them
to

04:58:26.830 --> 04:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh without some specific goals in mind
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i didn't hear
 
04:58:34.550 --> 04:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
any specifics from the commissioner
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
again i didn't ask him for any
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
but uh i didn't hear any specifics on
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
how exactly this is going to approve the
 
04:58:43.830 --> 04:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
overall so
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
that seems like a lot of money to commit
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
to something i would
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
support uh representative mcconkie's
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
idea of having some oversight is this
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
money spent
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
04:58:58.400 --> 04:58:59.430 align:start position:0%
and i think that
and

04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
in all honesty
 
04:59:04.550 --> 04:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
um having said on this committee and on
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
capitol hill
 
04:59:08.788 --> 04:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
i think we need probably to
 
04:59:11.030 --> 04:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
strengthen the language for all of the
 
04:59:13.590 --> 04:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
agencies to come back in and tell us how
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
they're spending
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
the millions particularly
 
04:59:19.590 --> 04:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
giving to them
 
04:59:22.230 --> 04:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
um not a periodic
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
someone that should be quarterly and
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
some of it should be semi-annually
 
04:59:26.320 --> 04:59:27.190 align:start position:0%
some of it should be semi-annually
um

04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
but at least get
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
a report of where the money is so that
 
04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you don't have five
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars being lapsed at the next
 
04:59:36.000 --> 04:59:36.868 align:start position:0%
billion dollars being lapsed at the next
fight

04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
fight
 
04:59:36.878 --> 04:59:48.310 align:start position:0%
fight
by

04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
evil suggested of raising
 
04:59:54.788 --> 04:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
dollar amount for
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.040 --> 05:00:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
encountered by representative conkey are
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
there any other comments
 
05:00:08.390 --> 05:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i know where representative edgar is
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thanks john um
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
05:00:19.830 --> 05:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm in favor of any emotions
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
to uh to increase the uh coastal
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
flooding monitoring
 
05:00:24.320 --> 05:00:26.310 align:start position:0%
flooding monitoring
um

05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
issue right here and uh
 
05:00:30.550 --> 05:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
believe me i'm i'm i'm really glad that
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh is a minimum i hope when we get done
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we can get in that range the
 
05:00:37.270 --> 05:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
hundred and you know sixty one eighty
 
05:00:39.510 --> 05:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
eight ninety um
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an awful lot of
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
support for this uh uh on the seacoast
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
and and up the pasquatica
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if we can take it out you know
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
whack a little bit off of one stop that
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be good or if there's some other
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
way of doing it
 
05:00:59.670 --> 05:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate any consideration on it
 
05:00:59.680 --> 05:01:00.868 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate any consideration on it
um

05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
but you know i realize that this you
 
05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
know this really is a tight budget right
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
now but i i hope we could find that much
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:01:14.470 --> 05:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
comments on this
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
can i just ask sure are we are we trying
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
to add another 889 to this 161. yes
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes that's the suggestion 340
 
05:01:25.920 --> 05:01:30.230 align:start position:0%
yes that's the suggestion 340
yeah

05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:30.240 --> 05:01:32.948 align:start position:0%
 
110.

05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
110.
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's not the word precise right no
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
well we've got 161 90 in there from the
 
05:01:42.070 --> 05:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
last line so that's the exact figure
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
i have some idea of how this process
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
works out
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that with 161
 
05:01:49.750 --> 05:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they're not going to be
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
what they need to accomplish
 
05:01:56.310 --> 05:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see it fully funded at their
 
05:01:56.320 --> 05:01:58.948 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see it fully funded at their
request

05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
but we have a motion on the floor i'd
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
like to you know i don't know represent
 
05:02:03.120 --> 05:02:04.628 align:start position:0%
like to you know i don't know represent
evil

05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
evil
 
05:02:06.550 --> 05:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
she did not make a motion she just kind
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
of threw the idea out there okay
 
05:02:08.958 --> 05:02:10.230 align:start position:0%
of threw the idea out there okay
um

05:02:10.230 --> 05:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:12.470 --> 05:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
i mean so we put allocated this is from
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
last money this morning 100 about 161
 
05:02:16.080 --> 05:02:17.510 align:start position:0%
last money this morning 100 about 161
890

05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
890
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
correct and i believe as i understood
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil she wanted to add to
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
the same program of coastal flooding
 
05:02:25.470 --> 05:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
another 180
 
05:02:25.480 --> 05:02:27.110 align:start position:0%
another 180
188

05:02:27.110 --> 05:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
188
 
05:02:27.120 --> 05:02:28.708 align:start position:0%
188
110

05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
110
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
to be taken if i understood her
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
correctly directly to be taken from the
 
05:02:33.920 --> 05:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
correctly directly to be taken from the
des

05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
des
 
05:02:36.550 --> 05:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
one stop
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
if i could uh that that was an option
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
that i put out there um i i mean we
 
05:02:56.550 --> 05:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
could try a motion i'd make that um the
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
other alternative i had mentioned is
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
simply writing into the
 
05:03:02.550 --> 05:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill that we give
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
des the ability to switch money from
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
between i i.t and the coastal flooding
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
for that 188
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to
 
05:03:12.718 --> 05:03:13.750 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to
but

05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:03:13.760 --> 05:03:14.708 align:start position:0%
but
if

05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:03:16.708 --> 05:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to make a motion if the
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
chair thinks that
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is the time
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's the time the center
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:03:25.280 --> 05:03:26.070 align:start position:0%
okay um
i

05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
move that
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
i may not have all the details here i
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
move that the uh des one stop
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
it budget
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
sorry if somebody can help me here i'm
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find the amount is it five
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand five hundred dollars
 
05:03:53.110 --> 05:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
we're getting reduced
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
by 1088
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 188
 
05:03:58.798 --> 05:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 188
110

05:04:00.550 --> 05:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
110
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
for that money to be
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
allocated to the
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
what are we putting in
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
the postal flooding program
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much mr clerk for
 
05:04:14.788 --> 05:04:14.798 align:start position:0%
helping me that is that's my motion
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
basically that the one-stop budget item
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
be reduced by 188
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
whatever mr mills said thousand um to be
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
used for the coastal flooding program
 
05:04:28.400 --> 05:04:29.350 align:start position:0%
used for the coastal flooding program
but

05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that to reduce that
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
one stop fractionally
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
by approximately 188 000
 
05:04:44.638 --> 05:04:45.510 align:start position:0%
by approximately 188 000
and

05:04:45.510 --> 05:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:45.520 --> 05:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
and
uh

05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:04:47.360 --> 05:04:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh
to

05:04:48.070 --> 05:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
be used for
 
05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%

two days next week
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
with a zoom license
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
one is start with the work session make
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
sure we're all in agreement
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:12:00.550 --> 05:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
have an executive session on an
 
05:12:01.990 --> 05:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment which
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration everything that
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
discussed and changed and changed at the
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
next work session if we change anything
 
05:12:12.948 --> 05:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
i would like to come out of this with a
 
05:12:12.958 --> 05:12:14.390 align:start position:0%
i would like to come out of this with a
consensus

05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the bottom line when we finish we may
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
not all agree on any given project
 
05:12:20.480 --> 05:12:22.070 align:start position:0%
not all agree on any given project
but

05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:12:23.830 --> 05:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
we are trying to do the best for the
 
05:12:23.840 --> 05:12:25.270 align:start position:0%
we are trying to do the best for the
state

05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
i will try also to get some more
 
05:12:27.520 --> 05:12:28.948 align:start position:0%
i will try also to get some more
definitions

05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
05:12:32.070 --> 05:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
before our next session
 
05:12:32.080 --> 05:12:33.270 align:start position:0%
before our next session
on

05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:12:36.390 --> 05:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
what strings or how
 
05:12:38.948 --> 05:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
the money that is coming
 
05:12:38.958 --> 05:12:42.070 align:start position:0%
the money that is coming
under

05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to be handled
 
05:12:45.670 --> 05:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think that that is
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
an important thing to know
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
there's going to be one or two large
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
fighters a whole bunch of small it's all
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
those things that are unknown at this
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
point so i think that we need as a
 
05:12:58.080 --> 05:12:59.190 align:start position:0%
point so i think that we need as a
committee

05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
and as a general court need to weigh in
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
on what is going on
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
do i have anything else from anybody
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
who's here representative jack i thank
 
05:13:09.680 --> 05:13:10.948 align:start position:0%
who's here representative jack i thank
you

05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have a section on it's
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
defense of the committee that we see the
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
federal funds on
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to consider adding the
 
05:13:21.510 --> 05:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
women's prison trades building as one of
 
05:13:24.868 --> 05:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:24.878 --> 05:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
i would certainly support that
 
05:13:33.270 --> 05:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
now why don't we do it this way because
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have another work session
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
before the finalization of remember
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
everybody spend the next few days
 
05:13:46.708 --> 05:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
going back through
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
the agency presentations
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
um and what we've heard what we know
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
and say if federal money becomes
 
05:13:57.120 --> 05:13:58.550 align:start position:0%
and say if federal money becomes
available

05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:14:00.868 --> 05:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
this is the project i would like to see
 
05:14:00.878 --> 05:14:03.430 align:start position:0%
this is the project i would like to see
done

05:14:03.430 --> 05:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:05.350 --> 05:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
and don't
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know because i i look at things like
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:14:11.190 --> 05:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
the leaky roof at the berlin men's
 
05:14:11.200 --> 05:14:12.230 align:start position:0%
the leaky roof at the berlin men's
prison

05:14:12.230 --> 05:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
prison
 
05:14:14.230 --> 05:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh that would probably be a nice thing
 
05:14:15.990 --> 05:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
to fix since
 
05:14:16.000 --> 05:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
to fix since
plus

05:14:17.430 --> 05:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
plus
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
little things like that
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
i am sure that several people will
 
05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
talk about more money for
 
05:14:24.560 --> 05:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
talk about more money for
the

05:14:26.550 --> 05:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
community college system or other
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
or other agencies
 
05:14:30.718 --> 05:14:32.628 align:start position:0%
or other agencies
and

05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:34.470 --> 05:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
we shall see but
 
05:14:36.868 --> 05:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
look through their presentations
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
look through
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
this book
 
05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:40.948 align:start position:0%
this book
um

05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
because there's lots of
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
unfunded things that were priorities for
 
05:14:46.718 --> 05:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
unfunded things that were priorities for
that

05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
and if nothing else we can at least make
 
05:14:52.230 --> 05:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
our desires known to the senate
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
and to
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
the governor whoever will
 
05:14:59.350 --> 05:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
be receiving this money
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
um so if you could do that i think that
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
trying to do it right now is going it's
 
05:15:06.868 --> 05:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
quarter or three in the afternoon
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
we've been here since 9 15 9 30.
 
05:15:10.160 --> 05:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
we've been here since 9 15 9 30.
um

05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're just not
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not as quite as i was
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
10 years ago but
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
you saved but definitely not 10 hours
 
05:15:20.080 --> 05:15:22.390 align:start position:0%
you saved but definitely not 10 hours
ago

05:15:22.390 --> 05:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:22.400 --> 05:15:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to come in tuesday for a
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
work session you could come in probably
 
05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
thursday right yeah if i can work that
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
and if i if we can get the work session
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
done early enough on tuesday
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
so they can start working on
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment some of the amendments
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
that they may be able to start with
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
um you know which lapses are being
 
05:15:51.910 --> 05:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
dropped in those kinds of things
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
but uh it's going to depend on
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
on us working
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
tuesday morning get it done
 
05:15:59.200 --> 05:16:00.708 align:start position:0%
tuesday morning get it done
um

05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:03.270 --> 05:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then let the amendments get drafted
 
05:16:06.550 --> 05:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
because that is what we actually do
 
05:16:08.550 --> 05:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
is everybody right
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
it's like any other bill it's up or down
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee and goes to the floor
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay and we're starting at 9 30 on soon
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's like on tuesday
 
05:16:22.390 --> 05:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully i don't have to get it
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
scheduled with this week's calendar so
 
05:16:31.030 --> 05:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.040 --> 05:16:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
licenses

05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
when the calendar had to go to bed
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
so i will be working on that
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.708 --> 05:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
and it is your intent i mean hopefully
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
we can do it tuesday tuesday thursday
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
and not have to come back unless you
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
said something if necessary the
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
following monday yeah
 
05:16:54.948 --> 05:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
okay and that puts it really tight
 
05:16:57.670 --> 05:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
because that is the deadline week and
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
400 some odd bills
 
05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
that still have to
 
05:17:05.590 --> 05:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
make it through
 
05:17:07.350 --> 05:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
committees and
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
either be retained or go on to the
 
05:17:09.360 --> 05:17:10.230 align:start position:0%
either be retained or go on to the
calendar

05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
so your intent is trying to wrap things
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
up by thursday yeah my intent is next
 
05:17:16.948 --> 05:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
week okay yeah all right just so
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
it is a little harder with with
 
05:17:24.868 --> 05:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
05:17:26.948 --> 05:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
members of the lba not being in the
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
building not being in the room with us
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
they are doing a phenomenal job
 
05:17:33.750 --> 05:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm doing it this way
 
05:17:38.550 --> 05:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
it is helpful and and
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
but that's why i'd like to get it done
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
as early tuesday as possible we give him
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
as much time
 
05:17:49.350 --> 05:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
and he and i will be in contact over the
 
05:17:51.510 --> 05:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
next couple of days
 
05:17:53.110 --> 05:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
trying to iron out everything that we
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
decided so it makes sense to him and the
 
05:17:56.240 --> 05:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
decided so it makes sense to him and the
drafters

05:17:57.990 --> 05:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
drafters
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's very important that the drafters
 
05:18:01.510 --> 05:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing
 
05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay and one other thing for the sake of
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
because hopefully we get a draft
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
amendment done by late tuesday so that
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
we can look it over
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
um because i think you know from the
 
05:18:13.270 --> 05:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
past you and i have sometimes we've had
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
some mistakes that we've had to come in
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
for a special meeting just to
 
05:18:18.868 --> 05:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
correct and that's why i said it's
 
05:18:21.750 --> 05:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
required for the following monday okay
 
05:18:24.550 --> 05:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
but if we meet tuesday
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
um agree on everything i don't think
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
that they'll have uh
 
05:18:38.310 --> 05:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.320 --> 05:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.590 --> 05:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
unless i get told otherwise
 
05:18:50.160 --> 05:18:51.510 align:start position:0%
unless i get told otherwise
um

05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
now let me tell you what the speaker
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
said to the chairs and vice chairs
 
05:18:57.990 --> 05:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
on monday morning
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the
 
05:19:01.110 --> 05:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
um calendar
 
05:19:03.910 --> 05:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
we will be meeting the 7th 8th and 9th
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
of april at the bedford sports complex

his intention is to start at 9 00 each
 
05:19:11.920 --> 05:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
his intention is to start at 9 00 each
morning

05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
and we go till six or seven in the
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh as i said we've got hundreds of bills
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we've got to get through
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
so if you have any friends who want to
 
05:19:23.520 --> 05:19:24.470 align:start position:0%
so if you have any friends who want to
debate

05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
debate
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
us bill 25
 
05:19:28.788 --> 05:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
please ask them not to
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
or make it one-on-one be against
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
somebody um
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
well it's it's just with 400 yeah even
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
if you only take three minutes each uh
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
each side and start running into time
 
05:19:43.350 --> 05:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
05:19:43.360 --> 05:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
and there are
um

05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
obviously some issues that are more
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
passionate than the capital budget that
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
people wanted to talk about
 
05:19:51.200 --> 05:19:51.990 align:start position:0%
people wanted to talk about
um

05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:52.000 --> 05:19:52.708 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:19:52.708 --> 05:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
we have to get our work done those three
 
05:19:54.958 --> 05:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
we have to get our work done those three
days

05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:19:59.430 --> 05:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i know that the majority of minority
 
05:20:02.550 --> 05:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
leaders agreed to suspend uh
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
changing the the deadlines and changing
 
05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
crossover date
 
05:20:08.788 --> 05:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
but that's about as far as we can go
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
because the senate still has to get the
 
05:20:10.560 --> 05:20:12.070 align:start position:0%
because the senate still has to get the
bills

05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'll schedule those at some point
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
probably after the night i mean
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh for new members
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
i'm appalled that we haven't had the
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
time to spend each other to look each
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
other in the eye but the the history of
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
this committee has been if we're going
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
to thrash this out i think we're very
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
close to being done so i don't mean
 
05:20:45.270 --> 05:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
thrash was way off base we need we need
 
05:20:45.280 --> 05:20:46.230 align:start position:0%
thrash was way off base we need we need
to

05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
come together on tuesday figure this out
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
and as the chairman alluded we'll come
 
05:20:54.550 --> 05:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
out with a opinion
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
we never
 
05:20:58.628 --> 05:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
we it's you can do it but we we would
 
05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
prefer not
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
again with the history of our committee
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
not to have a member speak against
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
another member of this committee on the
 
05:21:06.638 --> 05:21:07.590 align:start position:0%
another member of this committee on the
floor

05:21:07.590 --> 05:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
floor
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're one of the few committees that is
 
05:21:09.360 --> 05:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
we're one of the few committees that is
united

05:21:10.550 --> 05:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
united
 
05:21:10.560 --> 05:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
united
and

05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
and we will come together on tuesday and
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we can take care of it then
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and finally i heard mr chairman that
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the speaker is to
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
take up the the budget bills which i
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
assume would be house built on the first
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
day we meet them wednesday
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
because i think it's wednesday thursday
 
05:21:32.470 --> 05:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
and friday
 
05:21:34.470 --> 05:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's what i
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
thursday friday what he told the chairs
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
on monday morning was there will
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
probably be three parts of the calendar
 
05:21:45.190 --> 05:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the must-pass bills on
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh wednesday
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i i make the assumption that that's
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
one two and 25 because they're money
 
05:21:51.360 --> 05:21:52.230 align:start position:0%
one two and 25 because they're money
bills

05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
bills
 
05:21:54.310 --> 05:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
and there's probably a couple others in
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
other committees that people think of
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
are are critical
 
05:22:01.430 --> 05:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
but i would not be surprised if we
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
weren't the third or fourth motion i i
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
think we should be first frankly i would
 
05:22:07.750 --> 05:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that's what i did when i was i
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
asked her to go first because of the
 
05:22:11.190 --> 05:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
option he did it
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
if i get away with it if you get it up
 
05:22:13.600 --> 05:22:24.390 align:start position:0%
if i get away with it if you get it up
uh

05:22:24.390 --> 05:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
of representative jack on the capital
 
05:22:31.990 --> 05:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
142 and 143.
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
i don't claim to understand
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
this or the wording of it i wondered if
 
05:22:43.270 --> 05:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh two items on the river turning
 
05:22:43.280 --> 05:22:44.788 align:start position:0%
it's uh two items on the river turning
basin

05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
basin
 
05:22:49.030 --> 05:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:49.040 --> 05:22:50.868 align:start position:0%
 
continued

05:22:50.868 --> 05:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
continued
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's not there's money in those
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
but what this does is it was brought our
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
proof in fire by instance
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
when the
 
05:23:01.520 --> 05:23:02.628 align:start position:0%
when the
the

05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
congressional delegation finally got um
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
the court of engineers off the dime
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
the costume is higher and that's why uh
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
miss marconi had to come in for an
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
additional 1.7 so they're
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
52 left was given before okay i didn't
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
get that from the conversation well
 
05:23:26.230 --> 05:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh mr cody
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
gets excited
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions before i
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
