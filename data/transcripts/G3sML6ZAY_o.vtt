Rochester Ward 6 uh I come before you
 
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.949 align:start position:0%
Rochester Ward 6 uh I come before you
for

00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
1582 um which just to allow the
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
consumption of alcohol and artist
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
performance areas um so back in 2017 I
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
came before this committee um to change
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
the statute and the labor statutes um
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know trying to to classify
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
entertainers in New Hampshire um where
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
previously they've been known as
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
employees of the venues that they' be
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
performing at which in reality they're
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
actually uh private contractors that
 
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
bill has been signed into law so the
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
issue now the reason for this bill today
 
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
um is because certain rules are still
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
being enforced and I wanted to codify in
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
the statute um to basically allow the
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
venues to come up with their own rules
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
as far as where alcohol is permitted to
 
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.230 align:start position:0%
as far as where alcohol is permitted to
be

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
consumed um and I I have talked to to
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
other venue owners um who have said that
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission coming in and you
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
know threatening with fines and and you
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
know the revocation of Licensing um I
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
think is a little um excessive for what
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're actually you know uh uh
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
talking about with uh this issue so I'm
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
essentially I'm just changing the
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
definition of what an approved area is
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
by saying that stage um or other
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
performance areas is a permitted area of
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
a building for alcohol consumption um I
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually have another venue owner here
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
who's going to come up to um um and
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
speak to you as well about this issue
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
but um I can't think of a single
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
incident since I've been playing the
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
music scene since I was 16 years old um
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
up until now
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
um you know currently where there's ever
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
been a problem with having a drink on
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
stage we are you know um to my knowledge
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
the only state in the country that
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually enforces this and u l
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
commission uh does not have the manpower
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
to to Really enforce such an erroneous
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
rule not really codified in the statute
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason for this bill
 
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.629 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason for this bill
today

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
um uh you know it's not really that in
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
depth it's just really um you know you
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
know um just um improving you know the
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
definition of of what an actual approved
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
area for alcohol consumption is um I
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
just found it you know pretty arbitrary
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
to say that it's okay for one area of
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
the of the you know you know of um the
 
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
venue to say it's okay to buy alcohol
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
here but then you move to this area and
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
if you're performing at the venue that
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be allowed to have that
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
drink I I've I've never run into an
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
issue where an artist is is you know too
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
intoxicated to perform or there's ever
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
been any any you know serious issue that
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
would need you know the the police to
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
come enforce this either so U I'm just
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can you know finally
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
squash this for you know once and for
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
all and and actually um you know allow
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
the music scene in New Hampshire to to
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
questions um I guess I'm I I remember
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
we've had this bill before so I'm TR to
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
remember what we did now how about the
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
Green Room can they drink in the in the
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
back room where they're waiting I would
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
assume so yes
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
yep what what is this statute what does
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
the current law say now that they can or
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
can't do well that's the thing it's it's
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
not actually in the statute it's a
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission rule so what I'm doing
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
here is actually codifying in the
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
statute that it would be a legal thing
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
to have a drink on stage right it's not
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually in the statute so this must
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
been one of my great ideas to have the
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
department make a rule okay no you're
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
shaking your head okay okay all right
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay if I'm wrong I'm we'll we'll
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
just take it for for what it's worth
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay so all right any other
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee m MERS yes
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
representative bil just interested in in
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh knowing um where you perform some of
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
the you know me venues in in in the
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
state or that you've you know recognized
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
in the state there's been an issue yeah
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
my band has played in Manchester a
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
couple times uh we've never had a
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
problem with this we've never you know I
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm well actually I'll I'll clarify that
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
someone from from the venue did try to
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
tell me that it was not allowed but I
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
tried to explain to him that I have this
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
law changed and so there has been some
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
confusion still with with who is aware
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
of these rules and laws actually you
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
know changing to allow things or not you
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
know things are still being enforced
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
when they shouldn't be so this is more
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
or less just a cleanup Bill to to to
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually say here's where the line is
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
you know essentially what I'd like to
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
see happen is the state kind of get out
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the way and you know and and allow
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
the owners to make up their own rules if
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
they want to enforce that that is their
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
prerogative It's just not you know not
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
allowing the state to come in and say
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
well we're going to find you th000 or
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
take your license away you know say you
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
know so that's what we're trying to
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
avoid well you say you want the owners
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
to make up their own rules that's a
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
problem too we you got to have you got
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
to have guard
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
rails okay so um the end of the day the
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
first issue was are the employees in in
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
saying that because we we do say that no
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
employee is allowed to drink right on
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
duty so that was the first kind of
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
hurdle to get through the second is that
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
as our our issue of always um underage
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
drinking correct so that in terms of
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
where whoever's you know in just because
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
you're in the band doesn't mean you
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
automatically get to drink no and those
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
rules are still enforced okay and so so
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
the the guard we do need to have guard
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
rails I agree that's all I'm saying yep
 
00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:22.519 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you you

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
and not opposed to it um but Danielle
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
will go over that and and thank you for
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this up and there we'll clean
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
up how this where this sits and and how
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
it can actually be enfor but we haven't
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
enforce this probably in 2 three years
 
00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839 align:start position:0%
um it's one of those rules that or laws
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
it is a law um that needs to be cleaned
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
up uh and at that at that juncture um or
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
at this juncture it's probably a good
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
time to do it so um uh Danielle's been
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
working on it so I'll leave it up to her
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
to to testify to the rest of
 
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
it good
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
morning um so the bill as proposed
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually authorize uh the
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
consumption on the stage or in the back
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
areas it would be suited better in
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
17927 which talks about the approved
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
areas of service um so that's one of the
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
technical issues with the bill as
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
proposes this actually just talks about
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
the definition doesn't actually give the
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
authorization to consume on the stage or
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
in the back are we don't and we don't
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
like law in definitions I agree
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
y but other than that if um there's so
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
so humor me so when we pass this other
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
issue before did you guys generate rules
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
based upon that passage of that
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
legislation there's two parts of this
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill you have the entertainers consuming
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
and then you have the approved areas of
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
service they're two separate things okay
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
so in the past when it was approved the
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
entertainers couldn't consume the entire
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
time that they were employed by the
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
venue when the def when we they changed
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
it the consumption was allowed when they
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
weren't performing so when they weren't
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
on stage because the stage was an
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
unapproved area at the time so they
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
could come off the stage during breaks
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
or before or after their performance and
 
00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:58.990 align:start position:0%
or before or after their performance and
consume

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
consume
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
they couldn't bring the drinks on the
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
stage the stage was an unapproved area
 
00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:04.789 align:start position:0%
stage the stage was an unapproved area
under

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
17927 which says um no beverages or
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
liquor shall be served or consume in
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
foyers hallways kitchens restrooms or
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
other areas not approved for service by
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
the commission the stage used to be an
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
unapproved area it is no longer an
 
00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
unapproved area it is no longer an
unapproved

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
unapproved
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
area okay so you did that by rule that
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
the stage is approved we never it's not
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
in the statute you did that it used to
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
be rule it's no there is no stage in
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
rule so there was no law there is no
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh right so so that's what it's not
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
enforced now because the stage right but
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
you but the way the statute reads right
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
now says not approved for service by the
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
commission but if you never actually
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
said that that one way or the other
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
whether the stage was approved then this
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
is why some owners might correct this is
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
part of our
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
continuing rule reite that we're doing
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to fix this right yeah okay
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
okay but it has not been enforced like
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
the chief said in about two or three
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
years so right now we do have
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
entertainers consuming on stage but we
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
have you know we have so many law
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
binding liquor licenses out there they
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
they want to make sure that they don't
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
are non-compliant so the way they read
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
it they're a little concerned because
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
they so an easy solution to this is to
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
just add the stage to um as an under
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
17927 if we want to make it crystal
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
clear you can just identify the stage as
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
an approved area cuz this right just add
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
the sentence onto the end saying y the
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
stage area yeah and and ENT the the
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
cleanup in 2017 already authorizes the
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
entertainers to consume while they're
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
performing right and you also areas
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
designated for entertainers you know I.E
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
The Green Room we can add that sure okay
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll just take this sentence here
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
and lift it and put it into
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
17927 as
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
a new
 
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
sentence okay all right thank you very
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
much okay question oh I'm sorry I just
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
had a quick can you please repeat the
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
procedure so do we need this bill
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
amended or is the rule going to be
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
amended we are going to amend the
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
statute yes we will take this this
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
language and and instead when you'll
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
when you'll see when you when we have
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's a committee so there
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
will be take up it'll say um it will say
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
replace all because we're changing the
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
RSA okay is there also a rule change or
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
rule there is no rule change needed so
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
just the amendment okay thank you hard
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
gentlemen um good morning my name is
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
John from uh Jewel music venue in
 
00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.630 align:start position:0%
John from uh Jewel music venue in
Manchester

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
um uh it's kind of sounds like everybody
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
wants the same thing here so that's
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
great news um I just add a couple of
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
points uh that I had mentioned um couple
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
of things that um about about the what
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
is or isn't the current situation ation
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
now it seems there some confusion um the
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
first thing it does is it kind of the
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
way I believe it to currently be not
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
allowing alcohol on stage kind of takes
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
away from uh our staff
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
resources uh it keeps uh takes their
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
focus away from other more important
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
things like one thing you mentioned
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
earlier was underage drinking uh also
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes you you may find people uh
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
sneaking alcohol in which is prohibited
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
so I'd rather focus our energy on those
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
more important things um and and leave
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
it up to the artists to choose whether
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
they want a drink on stage or not some
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
artists um like I am right now a little
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
anxious and nervous about you know
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
speaking public sometimes they might
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
need a drink to calm them down and uh
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
and when we get uh performers in
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're you know we're paying
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
them a lot of money $4,000 or more and
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
if a guy wants to go up on stage and
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're saying no you can't do that they
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
they don't understand it's a New
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law they think it's our policy
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
or that that we're targeting them
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
specifically so it kind of builds a
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
contentious Report with them it's like
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
no you can't do and what are we supposed
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
to do ultimately like arm wrestle them
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
bite them throw them out you know
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
so if if if this law continues to stay
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
the way it if it is still the way it is
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
um and we're threatened with a fine for
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
you know letting someone have a drink or
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
or not being able to argue with them
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
about having a drink you you understand
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so and then and then the other thing
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
I think probably the most important
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
thing is the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
the El commission actually uh you know
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
licenses us and trusts us to serve
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of people daily
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
nightly thousands of people over the
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
course of a year um but they're kind of
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
saying but not those guys up on stage
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean so I feel like if
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
we can be trusted to serve all those
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
other people and and do it by the law we
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
should be able to you know manage that
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
as well so I think I think that's kind
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
of all I really had to say there um
 
00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.630 align:start position:0%
of all I really had to say there um
thank

00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%

good morning and welcome to Commerce
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
committee I come before you to present
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
HB 1151 this is an enabling bill that I
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
submitted after discussion with uh
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement after I took one of
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
my many trips up to our offices for my
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
corporate uh life up in Quebec City uh
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it was a surprise to me after a long
 
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
day of work when I got back to the hotel
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
and I was eating dinner at the bar and
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
wrapped things up that the bartender
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
said to me would you like me to mix one
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
up for you to take to your room I said
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
wait you can do that here when I came
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire I called The
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and I asked him can we
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
do that here and they transferred me
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
over to liquor enforcement and I was
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
told no no you can't do that here so
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is an enabling bill it does
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
not require any hotel to do this uh I've
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
actually had discuss discussions with a
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
Matthew Culver and Aiden Moore at liquor
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement to try to make sure the
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
language was uh okay with them I also
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
talked with some people at the uh that
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
Lobby for the hotel industry and they
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
were okay with it because we're not
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
forcing them to do anything the language
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill says that uh hotels may
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
allow guests to carry a drink back from
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
the bar to the hotel room but it also uh
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit them from designated
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
in certain parts of the hotel is no
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
alcohol allowed and it prohibits a guest
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
from taking that drink outside to the
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle to drive to a different portion
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
of the hotel or or in any way do that um
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
so I hope that uh that you'll support me
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
with this and uh allow our guests to do
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
what I did which was form a bond with
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
their bartender over dinner and then
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
like to make sure that if I'm getting
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
another drink to go back to my room that
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
he gets the tip or she and it it's not
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
me going to my room deciding I want to
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
order a drink to come up to the room
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
paying extra for that and not knowing
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
who gets my
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
questions U thank you um appreciate you
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question this seems to be a
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
little bit contradictory to another bill
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
and that other bill is for example let's
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
say I go to a restaurant with my wife
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
and we we ordered a bottle of wine and
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't finished the bottle of wine
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
which is unusual by the way but I I can
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
I can get that resealed and take the
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
entire contents of that bottle which
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
presumably would be more than one drink
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
so I always think that the same rule
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
should apply to the hotel that if I'm
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
having dinner there and I ordered a
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine I didn't finish it there
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
may be more than a single glass there um
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
but uh shouldn't I be able to take that
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
to my room so first of all let me say
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
that the difference there is that in the
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
hotel you are actually a resident of
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
those premises while you're a registered
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
guest there and this only applies to
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
registered guests you can't walk into
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
the hotel bar order a drink to go and
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
walk out with it um so that would apply
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
but if this passes and you are at the
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
hotel bar and you order a bottle of wine
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
you certainly should be able to
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
according to this take that bottle back
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
unsealed because you can take an open
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
bottle of beer a mixed drink a glass of
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
wine if this passes you'll be able to
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
take it from the bar to your room and
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
another thing I'll point out is I
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
limited the bill specifically to allow
 
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
one guest to bring one drink back to
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
their room so that you can't have a a
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
guest bringing a tray full of drinks
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
back to the room to supposedly give to
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
their other roommates but um you know
 
00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
this this limits one drink one person
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
one room um and it's within the premises
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
they don't leave the
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
premises but would you believe the
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is both can have
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
happen so theoretically if someone was
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
sitting at the bar and or excuse me at
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
the restaurant table and only finished
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
half their wine and they want to take
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
that half bottle wine up to their room
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
or home the home is clear home is clear
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we allow you to do that but it's
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
got to be stapled it's got to have the
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
invoice on top of it and you got to put
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
it in the back of your car okay not
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
withstanding all those requirements that
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
if if you're in the restaurant and you
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
want to take it up to your
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
room your bill says one drink but in
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
your the with the reference to law
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about we don't have any
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
requirements about where that bottle is
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
being taken right terms of going home so
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
you absolutely could then take that
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
bottle up to your
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
room but yes it would be in a in in a
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
plastic bag that sealed bag with the
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
invoice stable to it because there's
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
more than one drink in the bottle thank
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
you there more than one drink I would I
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
would believe that just a quick followup
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
what if the bottle was unopened then it
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a problem or or still that
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
the law the law actually requires that
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
the bottle had to been consumed there
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
had have been some consumption okay now
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
could you go into a restaurant and buy a
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine and walk out with
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
it depends on the restaurant right if
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
they want to absolutely yeah you can
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
kind of overpriced don't you think y but
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't but if you couldn't
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
hit the liquor stores closed that might
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
be and you didn't want to drive down to
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
the convenience store because they
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that nice tasty wine that
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
that restaurant has then as long as
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're willing to pay that premium price
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
then you're set to take it out as it as
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
a take out like because it's
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
sealed because it's sealed okay
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
represent me give qu question for the
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
chair then on that on that topic um I I
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
know in Pittsburgh you can go into the
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
bar and buy a sixpack Pennsylvania is a
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
whole different world can we can we do
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
that here I've never tried it here can
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
you if the if the liquor store is closed
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
and you want a sixpack of beer for your
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
Sunday foot what he's referring to in
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania is a controled state uh
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
similar to us um was that uh
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania didn't have uh and they've
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
now since changed the law but they did
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
not allow convenience stores to sell
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
beer so if you wanted to buy a beer or a
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine you uh well it beer was
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
my favorite story my beer is you would
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
go to the local
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
distributor and the distributor would
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
still be open and he would sell you the
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
sixpack K it was always great because it
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
was a garage door and it' be one square
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
of a garage door and they' have the one
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
of those rollers and then you go and buy
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
the case of beer your case of beer would
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
roll out at nine o'clock at night you
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
could be buying a case of beer however
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania did allow you to buy a
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
sixpack buy beer in the the bar at the
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
bar carry it out and and then carry it
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
out that was the only way I could find
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah there is there is a limit to well I
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
don't even know if the limited statutory
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
but I think they're closed it was the
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
only way I could find a sixpack of Iron
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
City to watch the sealers on a on a
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
football game because on a in town city
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
is no longer it's I see light any so my
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
my actual question is represent play
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing this up it's a
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
common sense bill on line seven could we
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
make it carry one drink per registered
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
guest in that guest's room I know you
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
said about not carrying a a rack of
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
drinks but what if your your other half
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
is upstairs I would I would say that's
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
you're bring dinner and drink that's a
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
fine amendment to me and if you were
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to do that I would say per
 
00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
registered guest over
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
21 there you go all right very good
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
thanks because you don't want them
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
bringing back four because there's also
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
two kids in the
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
room but there
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it gets into the debate of
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
registered guests because usually
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's only one guest name even though
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
there could be multiple people I didn't
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
want to go there that's why I just made
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
it one person and I said if the wife
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
wants one she has to walk down and ask
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
herself we'll have that discussion in
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
the in this
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thanks for taking my
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
question just a quick question cuz I
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
don't know this can you legally bring in
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
an unopened bottle of wine to a hotel
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely you can bring anything to
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
your room you want to so that makes no
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
sense not to do this this is basically
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
saying that the bar is allowed to let
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
you leave the bar area with a drink
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
because right now you can't do that yeah
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
so that's to so essentially this is an
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
enabling Bill allowing the hotel to say
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
you may leave the bar premises if you're
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
on your way to your room with the drink
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
that you got at our bar great thank you
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so and I and I'll um just for
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
discussion purpose so everybody knows we
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually had legislation uh I think it
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
was last year the before where we
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
broaden the circle from if you were
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
doing a wine tasting at a wine event
 
00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:57.079 align:start position:0%
that you could walk out into The
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
Vineyards with that drink and we allow
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
the kind of the perimeters um in the old
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
days uh the original statute was that
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
you could not leave the bar area you
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
could not leave that physical space and
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
carry your drink anywhere um we got a
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
little looser with that when outdoor
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that now it wasn't it used to
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
be fenced in areas now it's uh we just
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
have strategic plants to Define that
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
area they not supposed to walk out so
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
over the years we're kind kind of
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
loosening up and trying to relax it but
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's supposed to
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
be the responsibility of the leny to be
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
responsible of where that liquor is and
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
who has it and and making sure they're
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
not a over consuming and B they're over
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
21 thank you very much thank you all
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
right who should we have first M you
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
commission good morning Mr chairman uh
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers president CEO New Hampshire
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
lodging and Restaurant Association here
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill obviously this uh
 
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
does sound like a pretty Common Sense
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
solution um historically part of the
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
reason why you couldn't take your drink
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
out of the hotel restaurant and carry it
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
to your room is because it's about
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
approved areas right so the restaurant
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
is an approved area the hall the
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
elevator Etc are not normally approved
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
areas so um in talking to members of the
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
B of the industry um folks would love
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
this then they don't have to police it
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
um you know if they wanted to take a
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
drink to their room Etc um I thought it
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
was interesting your discussion about uh
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
to go if you recall during the pandemic
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
we the industry was empowered to uh do
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
some Togo we can still do that with an
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
additional license so your restaurant
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
license you would then get an additional
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
license for takeout or to go and so you
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
could then purchase six packs of beer
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
there are limits on what you can f buy
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
for Baron wine I think it's two bottles
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
of wine and uh yeah but the key element
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
not that I would interrupt you but the
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
key element was it had to be a contained
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
sealed bottle correct so it couldn't be
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
a pre-made gin and tonic for you correct
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
it has to be original manufactured
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
unless you had cutw G gen tonic that's
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
in a can rtds right um so so the what
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
this the flexibility in this bill it
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
allows for mixed drinks could then leave
 
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
the restaurant and provided they stayed
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
on the premises of the hotel so
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
obviously the industry think that thinks
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea um I will suggest
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
that uh if you love this idea you know
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
next year maybe we can take a look at
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
allowing mixed drinks to go
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
um with some sort of a ceiling
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
Arrangement but we'll save that for next
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
year over the commission's dead body
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
they won't allow that as you know that
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
they're not too crazy about that
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
suggestion so the question I would have
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
just and this is kind of posing for
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
everybody to think about um if someone
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
says okay I'm going to be taking it up
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
to my room and then gets uh on their way
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
up they stop by see an old friend in the
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
lobby the statue we're about to we're
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
working on is is that you were taking it
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
to your room would you be allowed to
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
consume it on your way uh what happens
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
if you stayed in that Lobby too long
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
what happens that or we can then clude
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
clude the lobby or the Halls being part
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
of the hotel
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
facility I don't want to answer for
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the experts in the room but my
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
sense of it would be that if you allow
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
this you've essentially allowed that the
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
entire footprint of the hotel is an now
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
approved area so I think that's the only
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
way the licensing structure works and so
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
I think at that point it would
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
essentially be okay so we need to be
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
care how we phrase that in terms of
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
taking it to the room we say is that
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's permitted now on the inside the
 
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.230 align:start position:0%
it's permitted now on the inside the
hotel

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yes and I but I think it is
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
probably okay to leave in the room as
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
the destination because I think if it's
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh just going into the hotel and
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
grabbing drinks and then bringing them
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
out to common area a hallway or wherever
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
it might the pool area for example I
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't know that hotels necessarily want
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
to be encouraging that per se but
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
certainly can appreciate that if a guest
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
has had a nice meal and has a couple of
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
glasses of wine left over on St makes
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
perfect sense yeah I'm just thinking out
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
loud because um I I can think of maybe
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh a reception where people where you
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
did choose to pull out a movable bar and
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
put it in the lobby and and therefore uh
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden that has now become
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
a serving facility and in those cases I
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
would assume that they had already
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
gotten that as an approved extension of
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
their service area because it's still
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know delineated by a certain space I
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
think where it gets a bit weird and
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
sketchy is you know they're grabbing
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
drinks and they're going to the workout
 
00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:41.079 align:start position:0%
room or to the business center or to you
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
know the pool area or something like
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
that I don't think the hotel is going to
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
I think that would that's a good
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion we want to make sure in the
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
amendment says improved service area add
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
that phrase y okay great any other
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a question about your
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
members is there a a a location or a
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
website um which indicates who the
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
members of the association are do you
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
have a list yes I think so um I know we
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
have it on our website I just don't
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
can't remember if it's behind a member
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
portal or not I don't recall but I think
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes I think it's on our website so that
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
okay so that can be obtained yes okay
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
thanks okay any other questions to the
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee members any none thank you
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
up good morning again committee members
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Mark armaganian chief of
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing for the Liquor
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
Commission division enforcement
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
licensing of course uh with me today is
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
uh deputy chief Danielle Elston valid
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
points that are being made through
 
00:49:58.829 --> 00:49:58.839 align:start position:0%
through all of testimony um Danielle
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
again on this one has been working
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
specifically uh on that so she can
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
actually get into the Weeds on it uh but
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
at the same time no pun intended that's
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
right um but uh but yes um again this is
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
one of those things that has been
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
to clean up things and we talk about
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
cleanups quite often in the last six
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
years that we've been together as a
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
group um with this Administration this
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be one of them also so I'll
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
leave it up to Danielle to testify to
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of it good morning um again the
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
location of the proposed language I
 
00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
don't think is the appropriate location
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
this is another one that the language
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
would be better suited under
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
179 um 27 which talks about the approved
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
areas of service so just strictly moving
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
um the proposed language and whatever
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
amended language is agreed upon to um
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
17927 it would be better suited there
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
statute great thank
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
you oh
 
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
we represent pus thank you Mr chair um I
 
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.109 align:start position:0%
we represent pus thank you Mr chair um I
have

00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
a question SLS
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
situation where I buy a bottle of wine
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
to take up to my room and uh can I take
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
it up to my room
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
sealed yes okay the second question is
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
if I have a little a glass of wine out
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
of it now can I still take it up to my
 
00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.670 align:start position:0%
of it now can I still take it up to my
room

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
opened we well we just discussed
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
theoretically under current law right
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
now they would have to put it in a
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
plastic bag and so i' have to go all
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
through that rigma roll just to take the
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine off to my this could
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
clear it up if we were if you were to
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
limit not limit the one drink or the
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
registered guest then this would allow
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
you to do that so this would clean that
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
up well because the way it's written
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
right now it says one glass it could so
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
we could say one glass or a bottle or
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine and we do have several
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
hotels that actually also have
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
combination licenses which allow you to
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
buy the bottles or the sixpacks in the
 
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480 align:start position:0%
lobby and bring those to your room thank
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
you so they have both an on premise and
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
an off- premise license
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that makes sense yeah we
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
have several how much is that it's part
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the combination conditional
 
00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
license so so it's no discount you're
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
just buying the two license cor they
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
just they're allowed to coexist you're
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
just buying two okay no no deal okay R
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you um just to be sure I
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
understood correctly uh so in in order
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
to um allow guests to bring uh a half
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine say which would be more
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
than one drink uh it would have to say
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh the revision to the statute would
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
have to say one drink or one open bottle
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
something like that correct thank
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
you yeah the the enforcement of bringing
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol into the hotel okay we do have a
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
statue to that says if you wanted to
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
bring wine to a restaurant a ly then you
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
um are supposed to require to bring it
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
like an hour before it has to be ahead
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the meal time but we do have an old
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
statue I assume that's still on the
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
books that do we take that off the books
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
that bring yeah okay so that one's gone
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the BYOB the boob
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
well no BYOB if the facility did not
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
have a liquor license where this issue
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
was if you had a liquor license
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
but somebody had this very special
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine and they wanted to use it
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant then um we used to have a
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
statue that you had to bring in ahead of
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
time but you're saying that that's gone
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time anybody could
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
bring a wine I didn't think you could at
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
all I can't believe we repealed that you
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
can't bring outside alcohol into the
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
establishment you can't bring outside
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
but when we talk about a hotel room it's
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
really up to the hotel who will decide
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
whether they'll allow you to bring
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
alcohol and I've known I have some
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
hotels say may go way over the top to
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
make sure you know no you know no no
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
don't bring anything any booze to your
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
to the room because obviously they've
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
had problems in the
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
past thank you chairman that that's
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
basically called a corking Bill and a
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
lot of states have right it was we have
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
that well then I thought you just said
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't have it we have the corking
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
bill which is what you described from
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning which is to put it in a
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
plastic bag L that's corking okay the
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
question you're asking is do if someone
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring the wine into the
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant okay if it's a wine that they
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
did not buy at that restaurant to bring
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
it in I'm telling you there used to be
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
an old law and I'm now hearing that
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line it got
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
repealed well I'm just saying there that
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
is a law in many states that you can
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
bring your own wine in and you just pay
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
a corking fee right we were one of the
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
first states to pass that role that was
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
that was Steve Avery St get back no we
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
have it it's just not called the corking
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
law We call we don't have a law that
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
allows you to bring your wine in we have
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
a law that allows you to buy the bring
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
wine in buy the bottle from the
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant the restaurant can cork it
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
and send you home so could you do me a
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
favor because I'm pretty sure we had
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
this statute on the books can you do a
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
little homework and
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
see why it got removed if it did get
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
removed removed at least find the
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
language and maybe we can put it back
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
in but it in my memory it it wasn't open
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
it was you would bring you're bringing
 
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know that you're bringing that
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
special wine that that you had and
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
you're bring it in because because the
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant didn't have it do you
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:22.549 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
I thought there was an hour I thought
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm I'm not crazy then so but
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
she do so am I uh I would say that when
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
it comes to uh liquor and fireworks
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
people make up their own laws he said oh
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a law against that there
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
really wasn't okay yeah the B BYOB is is
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
are restaurants that do not serve uh
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
liquor able to um ad that you can bring
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
in your own champagne like let's say for
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
Valentine's dinner that's fine y if they
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
don't have a liquor license they can do
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
a b do they need a license for that no
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
no oh jeez no no that's wide open vob is
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
wide open yes represent
 
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.470 align:start position:0%
wide open yes represent
spear

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
spear
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
spear what did I say Gibbs Gib oh
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm shorter I'm the shorter
 
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
one seems to be a requirement in this
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
Democrats I'm I'm a little confused on
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
the uh and this is probably for my own
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
information I was in a restaurant this
 
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
information I was in a restaurant this
past

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
summer and some friends of mine bought
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
in a bottle handed it to the head waiter
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
and said later on at dinner I would like
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
this bottle of wine and apparently they
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
had been doing
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:55.390 align:start position:0%
had been doing
that

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
so that's not
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
allowed not currently no were they a li
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
or were they are they a licensed
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
establishment do they have a liquor
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
license oh yeah yeah okay so they bought
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
it from them or they bought it they
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
bought it from home and had been
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
bringing it in I think they thought that
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
they could because the establishment
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
said yeah okay and then we'll serve it
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
later and so I thought that was
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly okay no I will tell them Tech
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
Tech no but that's what we're we it used
 
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:28.829 align:start position:0%
Tech no but that's what we're we it used
to

00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
be somehow somehow it disappeared
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere but we'll we'll find that baby
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
and get it so I would say that all of
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
this since it's all going to be in 179
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%

bill

well the conceptual Amendment yeah this
 
01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
well the conceptual Amendment yeah this

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
up I probably could have taken the

here today is Danielle Elman deputy
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
chief um Danielle has been working
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
working diligently on this along with
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
the other previous two bills so I'll
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
leave it up to her to testify to fair
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
enough good morning I guess maybe I need
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
you to fill out the three cards for
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
these two Bill these three bills sure
 
01:06:08.279 --> 01:06:09.390 align:start position:0%
these two Bill these three bills sure
thank

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
you um so the the main purpose of this
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill is um there's a new product in the
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
market that is an alternative um it's a
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
synthetic nicotine so it's not a tobacco
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
product um it's just simply a synthetic
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
version of nicotine it's sold in a pouch
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
or um in a
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
e-liquid and the um both the licensing
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
statues and the youth access statues
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't account for this product to be a
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
regulated product so the intent of this
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
bill which you'll see with the
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
definitions of the alternative nicotine
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
product both put it putting them under
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
the license and in 126k allows it to be
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
a regulated product you have to have a
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
license to sell it and you have to be 21
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
to to possess it P or purchase it um
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
right now it falls in a loophole where
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really meet any of those
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
definitions so it it becomes an
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
unregulated product so that's the main
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
purpose of of um what you're going to
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
see another section of this bill that
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
you will see um is this is another bill
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
I testified to a bill last week where
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
the fines are in
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
statute um fines and
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
penalties um the I'm sorry the fines for
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
the licy are in statute so we are trying
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
to move the fines and penalties out of
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
Statute into rule so that when we
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
rewrite the rules we can rewrite the
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
fines and penalties altogether rather
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
than having to manipulate each statute
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
to account account for those so the
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
fines and P fines for the license
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
establishments and the penalties are not
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
changing we're just moving them out of
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
Statute putting them in the 600 rules
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
the 600 rules are being written right
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
now um they're in the first processes of
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
the jail car review so they are in there
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
as you see them in the statute we are
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
just moving them from statute to
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
rule and then um I know chairman hun you
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
want to about the amendment for the last
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs why don't you
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
explain um so the last two paragraphs um
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
this was initially put in to allow for
 
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
regulated Vape products to be sold in
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the state um there was some unintended
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
consequences to the language as written
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I believe there is going to be a
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment submitted to this to um
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
further discuss the regulation of vape
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
and approved Vape products in the state
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
um that is you'll see the last um page
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
five uh paragraph six and then um
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph s you'll see um we do
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
encounter counterfeit and vape in the
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
State uh quite a bit so um this just
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
clarifies and gives us the authority to
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
deal with the counterfeit Vape as we
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
encounter it in the in the stores
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question about the
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
ingredients of this artificial tobacco
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
is there um does it need to be labeled
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
what's in it
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
or um I don't believe it's a all the
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
packages that we're seeing right now are
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
they are packaged products it looks very
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
similar to a chewing tobacco it's sold
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
in a in a tin or or in a a vape
 
01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
in a in a tin or or in a a vape
cartridge

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
cartridge
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
but again it's a synthetic nicotine so
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a a a real nicotine it's a it's
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
a it's just a nicotine product so it's
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
not tobacco there's no it's not created
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
from that it's just a synthetic nicotine
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
that you suck
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
on so the what are the
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
ingredients is it listed on the
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
container yeah yeah you're saying
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
synthetic but what does that mean yeah
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a it well some of it is
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
um we have whether natural or synthetic
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
so there's synthetic nicotine products
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
it's nicotine that's I guess handmade
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
manmade man-made nicotine and then
 
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
there's natural nicotine but they're
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
they're taking the tobacco part out of
 
01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
it and just selling it as the nicotine
 
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.390 align:start position:0%
it and just selling it as the nicotine
is

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
nicotine it's funny because I I read an
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
article about and they had a picture of
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
it they look like K Cups when in the Box
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
in the little shelves that Y and it's
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be extremely addicting
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
because it's it's pure nicotine they've
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
been popular in um overseas for a while
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
and they they've made its way over here
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear you may have
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
answered it uh so this synthetic
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
nicotine is very addictive yes oh yeah
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is very addicting stuff
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay which uh then brings up the other
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
question we've been enforcing Delta 8
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 right right
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
now yes and how's that going um okay
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're um we're
 
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
they're um we're
encountering

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
encountering
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
um when we last year when we regulated
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 Delta 9 it was anything um
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
nothing over I believe it's 03 .3% right
 
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
nothing over I believe it's 03 .3% right
um

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
we but there is not a lot of regulation
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
on the labeling and the the requirements
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the labeling also Banning the3 we are
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
finding Delta 8 and Delta 9 that's under
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
03 but it's not an age restricted
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
product so we are still having kids
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing Delta 8 Delta 9 um so that is
 
01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
something that is a loophole in the law
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
right now so when we work up this
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
amendment I I'm a little concerned
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
because I know we did Sunset it and I'm
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
a little concerned whether we're going
 
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
to meet that sunset uh and regulate it
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I would like to see an
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that will continue it and make
 
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
sure that again we're treating all these
 
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
products equally and that only only
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
licensed tobacco vaping uh facilities
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
could be selling that product okay and
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
and and as an age restricted product
 
01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.430 align:start position:0%
and and as an age restricted product
yeah

01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I I mean the the intent of
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%

Cannabis issue but that might not work
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
out so well this year so at this at
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
least that's that's legal let's Rel
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
Legalize It And but again allow only
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
those facilities to be able to sell it
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else have any other
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%

president of smoker Haven and uh we
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%

all of you uh for those changes so
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's all and how do you feel about
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
selling Delta 8 and Delta 9 I think it's
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable to have the age
 
01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
limits um on the product and uh it
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
surprises me to hear that there are some
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
stores that are willing to sell it to
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
anyone that's under that age um as our
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
internal policies is to sell it only to
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
people 21 plus
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%

director for the American Heart
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
Association um I have been wrestling
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
with this bill in the language in it um
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
I there's kind of conflicting thoughts
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether um this uh some of the
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
language in it is a good thing or not a
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
good thing so I'm coming to you opposed
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
only so that we can get on the record
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
that there are concerns and I would
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
really love to be um part of um any
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
process work sessions you know working
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill um the American Heart
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
Association strongly supports tobacco
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
retail licensure and um the uh my
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
initial concerns which I I think have
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
been allayed is to strike the fines out
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
of law before we see what's going to go
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
into administrative rules um but it
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
seems like it is the same uh structure
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to go into those admin ad
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
ministrative rules but concerns on that
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
um the other point which is not included
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill when you take out the fees
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
for the penalties for retailers but yet
 
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill um in statute I should say
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
um in 126k there is a provision for
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
penalizing the young people who are
 
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
accessing able to access these products
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
the whole point of tobacco retail
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
licensing is to put the onus on the
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
retailers to check for
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
um uh the age of of these purchasers um
 
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
we do not believe that we should put a
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
financial penalty on young people who
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
are being sold these products or getting
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
them even through other ways um that um
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
that really should be something that we
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
are are doing more of a an education
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
process or some other kind of um that's
 
01:15:50.189 --> 01:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
not in place yet but it's the financial
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
penalties is not is not great in the
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill though there's actually another
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
line within that section of 126k to make
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
this a misdemeanor um so it's a
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
violation it's a misdemeanor for kids
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
who are caught with these products so
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
that's you know a big sticking point for
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
us in this um and we would like to see
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
some some work done on that section if
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
this this bill moves forward we would
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
love to see the penalty completely
 
01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
stricken from statute and not put into
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that young people
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
are charged of financial um penalty for
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
for these products um and I just wanted
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
to make a point about the synthetic
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
nicotine so these it's not nicotine
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
derived from tobacco leaves it's created
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
in a lab but according the Food and Drug
 
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
Administration a couple of years ago put
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
synthetic nicotine underneath the ospice
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
of tobacco products so to say they're
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
not tobacco they're not derived from
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco but they are still considered a
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco product if they have synthetic
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
nicotine in them
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
um so this is an area where we do not
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
see um something happen in state law
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
while the Food and Drug Administration
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
are working through the process of
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
deciding which products will they will
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
authorize to be marketed and sold um
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of work to be done
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
on that at that that level um and the
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
state really doesn't have a lot of input
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
at this point on the Food and Drug
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
Administration process other than
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
regulating these products which I know
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission um tobacco
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement division is is working on so
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
I do have I'm a little confused you do
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
like that portion of the bill that we
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
are regulating those that nicotine that
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
fake or not nicotine product are you you
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
are happy we definitely want to see um
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco products whether they have real
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
um from tobacco or synthetic um the
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
other thing is the um the terminology of
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
alternative to um nicotine product is
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
again not actually a product
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
a name that is used by the Food and Drug
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
Administration so I'd hate to see it be
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
used as a car out or an exemption again
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know everything about this um
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know terminology and what its impact
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
would be it could be a good thing um but
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
I just want us to you know approach it
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
um in in conversation before just
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
passing the bill along well we don't do
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
that in Commerce we go to sub no no I
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
really enjoy the processes that um
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt that you you do in your
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee so very well thought out okay
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you but I I will again you know so
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
our support or opposition might change
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
as we move along with this bill but I
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
will turn we'll leave it as there's some
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
parts you like and some parts some parts
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
I don't so General will just have to go
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
with the post for and thank you very
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
much any questions you do have a
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
question if you want to take a question
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
can yeah can you just clarify your
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
thinking on what your opposition is to
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
like they being a monetary fine or
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
penalty to somebody under 18 is it just
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of they're under 18 they
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be fined or it seems like that
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
might be a way to discourage use it it
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
there are some people who do believe it
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
is something that will discourage use
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
but actually there isn't an evidence
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
that really bears that out um but what
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
we have seen not in New Hampshire
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily I don't really think that
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission has has instituted
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
that policy but if this is being um
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
regulated by someone other than the the
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement so local law
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement um school districts are
 
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
actually sending kids to court um being
 
01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
that are caught with this and it's
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
usually the kids that really can't
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
afford um to have their their lives have
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of a a record on it's it
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a criminal um consideration
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
for um to be caught with these products
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
the the industry does Market these
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
products to kids you know about the
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
flavors and and all of that that um so
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of marketing social media
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
pushing these products with young people
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and it is a a Gateway for getting a
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
whole new generation addicted to
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
nicotine and for the American Heart
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
Association nicotine is something that
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
that really can can cause um heart
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
disease or exacerbate um a a cardiac
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
condition that people have um so it
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
really does know what we have seen in
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
other places is that it is um sometimes
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
minorities um kids from lower income
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
families that are the ones most targeted
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
by these um penalties on
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
youth further question may inquire all
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
right that makes sense so when you say
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
and and just forgive me because I
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
literally am ignorant on this topic so
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
when it I definitely have the perception
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
that uh these vape pens are I guess more
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
ideal if someone's going to be smoking
 
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
something than smoking say a cigarette
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
itself is is there any truth to that or
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
is that just sort of uh what's is that
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
just the propaganda I'm hearing
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
so there still needs to be a lot of
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
study on these products as to what other
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
kind of constituents are inside the
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
product um so when you refer not you
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
when when it is referred to as an
 
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
alternative tobacco product the idea is
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's you know getting people you don't
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
don't smoke use these products instead
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's more of a marketing um but they
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
are not cessation tools it's not
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
something that will get people off of
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco and that's really what our uh my
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
organization's endgame goal is is to get
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
people off tobacco in
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
general thank you representative spear

you very much Kate fry from new
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
hello I'm sorry I'm late and I got my um
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
note card but I couldn't find you um my
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
name is Kate fry I'm the vice president
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
of advocacy at new futures um I actually
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
am here in support of the bill it did
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
take me a little while to understand
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
what the bill did I do thank um The
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission for pointing out um
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
some issues uh with that I had trouble
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
understanding and making some sense of
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
them uh first of all regarding the fines
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I do not have an issue of them being
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
removed from statute and put into
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
administrative role having worked in the
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
that typically is where the fines live
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
it's just easier to manage to update so
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
I think as long as the promulgation of
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
the rules uh are parallel with the
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
statute and there's no um uh period of
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
not having anything then we should be
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
fine I did not understand what
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
alternative nicotine product was now I
 
01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
do now understand that definition
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
nicotine is addictive we need to um make
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
sure these products are regulated um we
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
hear often that something like vaping or
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe this type of product is safer CU
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
it's not tobacco but nicotine is equally
 
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.310 align:start position:0%
it's not tobacco but nicotine is equally
as

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
addictive I think of myself as well
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
educated in public health and I had two
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
College age daughters both addicted to
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
nicotine through vaping so it's
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
something we really have to be uh
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
serious about and make sure that we are
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
regulating um the last item um I
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
understand it may be moved to a
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
different bill but I do think it's
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
important to have a better understanding
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
of uh this in section 4 uh regarding the
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
pre-market tobacco product application
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
process um again I would just like to
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand it better if it is a tool to
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that products are safer out
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
there we have to we should look into
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
that um you've heard me testify on hemp
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
related uh Delta 9 Delta 8 products um
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
there are some serious products out
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
there that are not regulated and are
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
very dangerous so whatever we can do to
 
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
get close to safer products I'm
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
interested in watching the sub
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
commmittee work study committee's work
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
so I realized you were a little late but
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
I did suggest that we will put Delta 8
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
and Delta 9 in this bill and add it to
 
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
the regulation that was my understanding
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that makes sense yeah thank
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
much anybody else would like to testify
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1591 oh we got one more we
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
up really are we going to really charge
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
miners for misdemeanor no okay because I
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
remember there was some that's where
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's where exactly that was a Chin's
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
problem no just to clarify there's three
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
penalties in 126k right
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
now what's being moved out of Statute
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
into administrative rule is the
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
penalties against the licensed
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
establishment which is where all of our
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
administrative penalties live then
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's a penalty against the minor
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
which is a violation for each offense a
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
$100 fine and 20 hours of or 20 hours of
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
community service right or and or um an
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
education program then there is the
 
01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
penalties for or the clerk who sells to
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
the minor which is a violation for a
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
first offense and a misdemeanor for a
 
01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.550 align:start position:0%
first offense and a misdemeanor for a
second

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
offense so those are the three different
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
penalties in there so a minor cannot be
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
charged with a misdemeanor for
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
possession of Vape or tobacco products
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
oh right because because it was a Chin's
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
problem before about the memer so and I
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
remember it was skateboarding it was
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
something were that that so the word
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor will be removed it's just
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
simply a fine it's it's not in there at
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
all it's not in there it's only in there
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
pointing at the clerk or the owner of
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
the The Establishment not at at the
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
Juvenile the
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
juvenile what it's a violation $100 it's
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
a viol right it's not a misdemeanor it's
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
a violation and and you're hitting
 
01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
exactly where I wanted to go with this
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman is the monetary fine
 
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be in there as a deterrent but
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
when you put Andor into it years ago
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
that gave us the latitude to deal with
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
this in an education point of view which
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's the platform for this
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
this Administration is to teach the
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
right way uh for compliance so we we
 
01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
look at this as twofold there needs to
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
be a monetary deterrent but at the same
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
time the latitude to do exactly what was
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
test commity service absolutely okay
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
community comme members
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
represent it's uh once again about the
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
synthetic uh tobacco um
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
we were just reading how it is very
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
addictive as addictive as heroin so if
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
someone um dies you know smoking too
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
much of this I mean what what happens
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
you drink it we eat it oh you eat it you
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
eat it yeah but if you
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
overdose it doesn't seem like it should
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
be even allowed to be sold but H who
 
01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.189 align:start position:0%
be even allowed to be sold but H who
determines

01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
that regulated by the FDA so this point
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah this point it's on the market so
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
now you jump into the argument of
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not nicotine needs to be
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
legal or not legal so it's it's one
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
level away from where we are today yeah
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
and that's are you as a legislative body
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to ban nicotine or are we just
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to age regulate it and that's
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
where we are today is the age regulator
 
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
you actually a good question let's go
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
get okay every everybody all set thank
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
you very much having no more cards
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
nobody raising their hands and saying
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
they want to talk we will close the
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.040 --> 02:00:48.109 align:start position:0%
 
1591

02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:06:17.589 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.599 --> 03:26:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:50.309 --> 03:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about my
 
03:26:53.670 --> 03:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
delay uh and uh yes anyone can feel free
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
to stand so that means all the gentlemen
 
03:26:56.990 --> 03:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure the ladies have a
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:10.189 --> 03:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all you young youngsters make
 
03:27:14.670 --> 03:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
seat okay um so uh where we left off is
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh we asked represent Leon to uh work up
 
03:27:27.550 --> 03:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
a new Amendment so I'll ask
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Leon wherever she
 
03:27:32.429 --> 03:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
is we have to
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
oh are on you need some time that would
 
03:27:43.510 --> 03:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
work well okay all
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
right okay uh so is representative tur
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
do you you want to make a pitch for one
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
more time
 
03:27:55.110 --> 03:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
for this is not a hearing you want to
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
just talk we talk about actually we
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
don't pitch I don't want to have too
 
03:28:01.269 --> 03:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
much we I'll just engage you in the
 
03:28:04.750 --> 03:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
conversation okay so where I'm I'm at
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill is that way I proceeded
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
it the idea that the Liquor Commission
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
was going to put pieces of paper in
 
03:28:16.269 --> 03:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
everybody's bag was it was a
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
nonstarter and but at the end of the day
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
so we were trying to narrow it down I
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
mean new Futures posters in the stores
 
03:28:26.309 --> 03:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
is really should be a no-brainer and I
 
03:28:28.469 --> 03:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
don't I'm surprised we don't have them
 
03:28:30.429 --> 03:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
already the commission would never have
 
03:28:33.030 --> 03:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
a problem I'm sure taking those posters
 
03:28:36.429 --> 03:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
so really the the where we're down to
 
03:28:39.150 --> 03:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
now is
 
03:28:42.670 --> 03:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
um the S slips right are we down to the
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
sales slips and that what we want to we
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
want to say something on the sales
 
03:28:51.910 --> 03:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
slips okay um and I know that you
 
03:28:55.189 --> 03:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably sent me the the the four
 
03:28:57.790 --> 03:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
questions or something in terms of that
 
03:29:01.710 --> 03:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
space um what I uh
 
03:29:05.950 --> 03:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
my to be frank we had a bill in this
 
03:29:07.750 --> 03:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee where we learned more than we
 
03:29:10.349 --> 03:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
ever really wanted to know about the l
 
03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
commission's o obligations to
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
fund drug prevention alcohol
 
03:29:19.309 --> 03:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
prevention and and how we had a room
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
full of people tell us to not touch that
 
03:29:24.510 --> 03:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
sacret and so where I'm inclined to do
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
is try to get the Liquor Commission do
 
03:29:34.269 --> 03:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
what you would want them to do in terms
 
03:29:38.349 --> 03:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
of having some space on the
 
03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
slip to say what what um that I think
 
03:29:45.189 --> 03:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
you had what four
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
questions yeah th those were examples uh
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
um uh Aiden Moore had asked me to sort
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
of just do a very quick mockup of what
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
it might look like I am not a graphic
 
03:29:59.070 --> 03:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
designer so I very briefly took a a a
 
03:30:00.990 --> 03:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
sales receipt picture from the internet
 
03:30:04.189 --> 03:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
and pasted a very crude thing on it so
 
03:30:06.269 --> 03:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
it was not meant to be a a product in
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
any way just a a an example yeah but an
 
03:30:13.469 --> 03:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
example but it's uh but again in my mind
 
03:30:16.349 --> 03:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
um anything we can do to educate people
 
03:30:16.359 --> 03:30:17.269 align:start position:0%
um anything we can do to educate people
about

03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:30:20.030 --> 03:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
988 is a big thing but you're saying
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
you're trying to be head of the curve of
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
988 98 is sort of like a last
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
resort well 988 is the referral resource
 
03:30:31.349 --> 03:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
for uh people with uh alcohol use
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
disorder and many other substance uh use
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
issues so the 988 campaign and the
 
03:30:40.870 --> 03:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
resource is much more broadly focused
 
03:30:43.229 --> 03:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
the the the the production of those
 
03:30:45.389 --> 03:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
posters are targeted at the general
 
03:30:49.150 --> 03:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
public um as opposed to what this bill
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
was intended to do which was sort of
 
03:30:53.950 --> 03:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
place this in the hands of the people
 
03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
who are are coming in on everyone but on
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
a those particularly coming in on a
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
frequent basis to our Liquor Stores um
 
03:31:05.469 --> 03:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
to both present a series of you know
 
03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
scientifically developed questions that
 
03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
are used to screen for alcohol use
 
03:31:11.790 --> 03:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
disorder and I paired those down to um a
 
03:31:13.830 --> 03:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
common set which is the four question
 
03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
set there's others um and pair that with
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you answered yes to this call this
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
number and that's the idea behind um
 
03:31:25.229 --> 03:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
behind pairing the questions with the
 
03:31:27.630 --> 03:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
988 resource and and again I think
 
03:31:29.950 --> 03:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
ideally both on the on the poster but
 
03:31:32.189 --> 03:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
but mostly on the receipts I would say
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
is my is my main goal with that and I I
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
did speak to Jenny O Higgins at the
 
03:31:39.550 --> 03:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services and she said
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
she developed those the content for
 
03:31:44.910 --> 03:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
those posters um uh and I think new
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
Futures has produced them but um you
 
03:31:50.110 --> 03:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
know she she greed and I think she may
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
have sent something saying that you know
 
03:31:55.309 --> 03:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
that those are not exactly sort of the
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
right instrument in the long run but
 
03:31:59.189 --> 03:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
she'd be more than happy to provide them
 
03:32:02.110 --> 03:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
in in the short term good perfect so uh
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
in my mind we um this is reason we're
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
doing this is because this is an early
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill which means you would go to finance
 
03:32:11.950 --> 03:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
and and then they're GNA have to come up
 
03:32:13.710 --> 03:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
with some dollar amount or what this is
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to cost and I I I I to me that
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
that looks like an opportunity for the
 
03:32:21.550 --> 03:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee to kill this bill and
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
and and lose this opportunity so my take
 
03:32:28.189 --> 03:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
on this bill is to work with the
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
commission and get them to do
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
something okay and so therefore I my
 
03:32:36.189 --> 03:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
take will be interim study but but be
 
03:32:38.429 --> 03:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
before they get there I want to have the
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
commission to uh tell us how what
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
they're where they are and how we could
 
03:32:47.189 --> 03:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
do something so that we don't have to
 
03:32:50.189 --> 03:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
have legislation that would die that we
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
would get this to make it happen and we
 
03:32:55.229 --> 03:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
would certainly have this bill uh we
 
03:32:57.309 --> 03:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
inter room study we would have this bill
 
03:32:59.110 --> 03:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
come next September we can see what they
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
did and see whether we accomplish our
 
03:33:04.830 --> 03:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
goal or whether you know legislation
 
03:33:07.870 --> 03:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
really has to has to happen so thank you
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
very much is there any other questions
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
that anybody would like to ask Kim
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
or B I think we're doing good all right
 
03:33:16.910 --> 03:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much stay right here
 
03:33:20.349 --> 03:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
so you can just you don't go far but
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
let's have the commission Chief are you
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:34.030 --> 03:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
over good
 
03:33:37.469 --> 03:33:37.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman committee members
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh I just got done mark armaganian from
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission division of
 
03:33:44.510 --> 03:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing I just got done
 
03:33:46.750 --> 03:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
talking to the uh chairman of the Liquor
 
03:33:50.590 --> 03:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
Commission Joe Malika um we're gonna
 
03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a left-hand turn on
 
03:33:54.229 --> 03:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
this and and the way we're going to do
 
03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
it is the chairman is actually proposing
 
03:33:59.070 --> 03:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
to do a commercial that actually plays
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
on a f minute Loop in our
 
03:34:06.510 --> 03:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
Stores um with partnering up with um
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
suppliers and Brokers so that the
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
message is continually only playing in
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
between the commercials that are
 
03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
actually playing on product in the
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
stores um this is something that is
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
brand new in in the making right now but
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
he is figuring somewhere between 90 days
 
03:34:30.630 --> 03:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
to 120 days to actually pull this off so
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
he's we're really excited about it it
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't something that we had been
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with in the last session but we
 
03:34:40.110 --> 03:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
feel that this is the best way to get
 
03:34:42.429 --> 03:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
out to all all the consumers and and the
 
03:34:46.110 --> 03:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
public that visit our Stores um and and
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
to push the message forward that the
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative is looking to push
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
forward and and we agree um we think
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's a really good way to do it and and
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
I compliment the the chairman on uh
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
pulling on his uh network of of Brokers
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
and and suppliers to to actually pull
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
off this
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
endeavor so you're not crazy about
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
putting it on the on the invoices so we
 
03:35:16.630 --> 03:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
spoke about that and and where that that
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
seems to be a very good idea and a cheap
 
03:35:23.150 --> 03:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
um response to this at the end of the
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
day we see that people that take the
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
receipts after a transaction will nine
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
out of 10 times maybe less than that
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
crumple them up stick them in their
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
pockets or they will not take one at all
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
and and and being fiscally responsible
 
03:35:44.590 --> 03:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
at at the lowest level at our consumer
 
03:35:46.670 --> 03:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
level they're sitting there saying don't
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
waste the paper and and we appreciate
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
that in state business of course but at
 
03:35:55.389 --> 03:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um knowing what we
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
know of our stores and the setup I'm
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
sorry that I have my back to you um
 
03:36:02.830 --> 03:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
knowing the setup of the stores and the
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money that has been spent on
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
AV Equipment in the stores we believe
 
03:36:09.670 --> 03:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
that this is a perfect way to push out
 
03:36:12.990 --> 03:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
the message with professional uh with a
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
professional um uh entity that will make
 
03:36:19.150 --> 03:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
this commercial at the same time using
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
professional actors um so that it's a
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
product that is indicative of the
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
product that the Liquor Commission puts
 
03:36:28.469 --> 03:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
out every day of the
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
week okay representative
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
s so what if any cost would it be to
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
actually put I understand most people
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
maybe don't take the receipts but if
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it on receipt what
 
03:36:39.990 --> 03:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
would that cost would it actually cost
 
03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
anything or is it like does it really
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
matter I'm going to defer to Aiden
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
receipts good day my name is Zaden Moore
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
I'm a legal coordinator for the Liquor
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
Commission thank you for your question
 
03:36:59.030 --> 03:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative I think what we found is
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
that um speaking to Mr Jim Richards who
 
03:37:04.510 --> 03:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
directs the store operations that the
 
03:37:07.229 --> 03:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
commission uses approximately a thousand
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
cases of receipt paper per year
 
03:37:11.479 --> 03:37:12.630 align:start position:0%
cases of receipt paper per year
and

03:37:12.630 --> 03:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:15.229 --> 03:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
to there is not enough room on the front
 
03:37:18.910 --> 03:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
of a receipt to have a message print we
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
we can print one line that's what's
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
available on the front of a receipt if
 
03:37:26.950 --> 03:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
we were to say utilize the back side of
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
the receipt for this
 
03:37:31.590 --> 03:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
messaging um we would need to go out and
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
get an RFP go out to bid on it uh but we
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
estimate that it would be anywhere in
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
the vicinity of maybe 30 to $40,000 to
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
produce a receipt that has the
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
pre-printed message on the back that
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
would then run through the
 
03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:48.750 align:start position:0%
would then run through the
registers

03:37:48.750 --> 03:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
registers
 
03:37:50.790 --> 03:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
so are you saying you wouldn't be able
 
03:37:52.189 --> 03:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
to change I don't know if this would
 
03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
even be a cheaper option but are you
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
saying you wouldn't be able to change
 
03:37:58.269 --> 03:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
the program to say all all the things
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
that I bought show up and then at the
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
end you know maybe there's an extra inch
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
or half an inch of space where it's like
 
03:38:06.550 --> 03:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
you if you think you have do you show
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
these symptoms do you are you concerned
 
03:38:10.110 --> 03:38:10.120 align:start position:0%
call this number whatever the message
 
03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
might be are you saying that wouldn't be
 
03:38:15.070 --> 03:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
something you could program in yes
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's correct on the front side so you
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to program that in we
 
03:38:19.710 --> 03:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
could not we've we've talked to the IT
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
people the commission is in the process
 
03:38:24.110 --> 03:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
of rolling out uh a new comprehensive
 
03:38:27.469 --> 03:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
software package called NextGen MH uh in
 
03:38:29.389 --> 03:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
checking with the the programmers and
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
the people who work on that project uh
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
we were told that we have room for a
 
03:38:36.910 --> 03:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
single line on the bottom of a receipt
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be on the front now the
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
printers aren't capable of printing on
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
the back we just don't have that in the
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
software nor do we have the printers
 
03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
that are capable of that so we would
 
03:38:49.950 --> 03:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
have to go out and get paper pre-printed
 
03:38:52.110 --> 03:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
to deliver the message on the back on
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
the back so you're saying that you
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to for the
 
03:39:00.429 --> 03:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
questions this you can have a long young
 
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that like you you
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do a I don't know it
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
seems to I don't know the it of it but
 
03:39:08.910 --> 03:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like it would be possible
 
03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
to like
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
have like a barcode you scan that has a
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
message and it's almost like you bought
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
another item and that's that's like a
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
default of everyone so if I have 20
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
items that I buy you now have 21 items
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
that are included in there and that 21
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
item is a little message that that the
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative would like to see on a
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
receipt well I think when the
 
03:39:31.630 --> 03:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
representative and I have been talking
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the for a while on this I think the
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
idea is that his desire and I think you
 
03:39:41.309 --> 03:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
heard him in his testimony indicat that
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
the message is a more comprehensive
 
03:39:45.309 --> 03:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
message than what could be delivered in
 
03:39:48.790 --> 03:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
a single line and and
 
03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:50.469 align:start position:0%
a single line and and
therefore

03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
03:39:53.349 --> 03:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
um it couldn't be boiled down and
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
condensed in a way that would get the
 
03:39:58.750 --> 03:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
consumer the information they're looking
 
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
for so he that's why when I asked him
 
03:40:04.590 --> 03:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
when we spoke about what would you like
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
it to look like what what kind of
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
information do you want to see on it he
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
gave us an idea of what is that he
 
03:40:12.750 --> 03:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
wanted including I think he mentioned
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
the four areas that uh person would uh
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
ask self analys you produ uh conduct a
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
self analysis to see whether or not they
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
have enough symptoms that they have
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
maybe possibly an alcohol use disorder
 
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
so therefore um we came up with an idea
 
03:40:31.750 --> 03:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
well what would it cost to put it on the
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
back if we can't get you a comprehensive
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
message on the front what would we do to
 
03:40:38.670 --> 03:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
get it on the back and that's where we
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
found out we use approximately a th000
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
cases a year and the cost to uh to
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
produce it would be up up in the range
 
03:40:46.920 --> 03:40:47.790 align:start position:0%
produce it would be up up in the range
of

03:40:47.790 --> 03:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
$440,000 okay thank you thank you uh
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs is next thank you
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
um about a week ago I bought one bottle
 
03:40:59.389 --> 03:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
of wine in the state liquor store and I
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
took the receipt and when I got home I
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
looked at it and it was about that long
 
03:41:07.710 --> 03:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
for one bottle of wine now I will be
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
honest with you that I did not read
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
everything that was on it but there was
 
03:41:15.389 --> 03:41:15.399 align:start position:0%
an awful lot on it it was that long
 
03:41:18.469 --> 03:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
isn't there anything on there that could
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
be taken out to make room for this
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
message to be printed automatically on
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
the front the way apparently an awful
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff is being printed
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
automatically on the front
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
now uh thank you representative I've
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
been told that no it could not be that
 
03:41:35.790 --> 03:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
the messaging that's on the front is is
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
in fact what the
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
commission um utilizes to to summarize
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
the sale to give them additional
 
03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
information about maybe programs that
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
are going on opportunities for different
 
03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
sales things of that nature and that the
 
03:41:54.030 --> 03:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
space available on the front with the
 
03:41:55.630 --> 03:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
existing information that the commission
 
03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
wants to put on to the receipt would be
 
03:42:00.429 --> 03:42:00.439 align:start position:0%
just a small print small area on the
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
front or we have completely blank areas
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
on the back and we would have to tell us
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
specifically why what's on the front now
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that could I mean you
 
03:42:12.120 --> 03:42:13.189 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that could I mean you
haven't

03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
specified of what's on the front and why
 
03:42:18.990 --> 03:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's all so essential why isn't there
 
03:42:21.229 --> 03:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
anything that you could take
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
out well representative I I I I do not
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question I I am
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
I ask the people who are
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
responsible uh for producing that and
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
they've indicated that the availability
 
03:42:36.990 --> 03:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
on the front is one line does any my
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that perhaps anybody have
 
03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
a receipt I mean I I usually have one
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't does anybody have have a
 
03:42:45.550 --> 03:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
receipt in their pocket but my
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion is nobody in the room my
 
03:42:50.670 --> 03:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that should be considered
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
um because what's what's on the receipt
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
is what the Liquor Commission decided
 
03:42:56.950 --> 03:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
they want but they don't necess I mean
 
03:42:59.389 --> 03:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
it's not the word from Mount Si it's
 
03:43:02.429 --> 03:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's not all absolutely essential I
 
03:43:04.510 --> 03:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
would say take a look at it and think
 
03:43:04.520 --> 03:43:05.469 align:start position:0%
would say take a look at it and think
about

03:43:05.469 --> 03:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
it I'll make sure that get communicated
 
03:43:11.309 --> 03:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you sen
 
03:43:13.630 --> 03:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
Bros thank you for taking my question I
 
03:43:15.030 --> 03:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
just want to understand the video
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
because I think you said it' be
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and then the message so is
 
03:43:20.590 --> 03:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
it going to be drink our bottle at
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
tequila and then go to rehab well I I
 
03:43:26.469 --> 03:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
think you when you look first of all
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative um I think when we we
 
03:43:33.189 --> 03:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
look at our signage it's a message board
 
03:43:35.790 --> 03:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
right only it's a virtual message board
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
and with that virtual uh message board
 
03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is a lot ofu stuff that might be
 
03:43:44.189 --> 03:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
on it there might be a bottle um or two
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
that are actually being advertised on
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
that message board as that goes and and
 
03:43:53.229 --> 03:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh to actually think about this in in
 
03:43:55.830 --> 03:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
its purest sense as those bottles are
 
03:43:57.950 --> 03:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
going through to have a message or a
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
commercial in the middle of that saying
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
if you if you have circum or you have
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
tripped um because we know good people
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
have tripped along the way we we deal
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
with that all the time um but but at the
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's probably a very
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
viable place for that message to be it'd
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
probably be a uh I don't know this is SE
 
03:44:26.189 --> 03:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
in its infant stages right now I say a
 
03:44:29.149 --> 03:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
minute or two message with professional
 
03:44:32.349 --> 03:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
actors um with professional thought put
 
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
into it not us in winging it um
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
indicative of the brand um at the end of
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
the day there's a lot of time that has
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
been put into this brand from this
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee alone not only the employees
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor Commission and and the
 
03:44:50.670 --> 03:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and Deputy Commissioner so uh
 
03:44:53.149 --> 03:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
as we as we move forward if this is the
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
Endeavor that is is a viable Endeavor
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
that this committee would like us to go
 
03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
forward with and this is something that
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
could replace I I really I know how I am
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
on on re I think the receipt idea is a
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
good idea I totally didn't think that
 
03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
this was a viable solution last week
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
when we were here um in my my
 
03:45:18.750 --> 03:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with the the chairman on
 
03:45:22.149 --> 03:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
the way out the door he he threw that at
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
me to tell this committee that's what he
 
03:45:27.990 --> 03:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
has proposed and that's what he wants to
 
03:45:32.830 --> 03:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
do um I literally was uh my mouth my jaw
 
03:45:35.110 --> 03:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
dropped I think that's very
 
03:45:37.870 --> 03:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
benevolent um at the end of the day that
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
to know that our partners uh in the
 
03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
industry are willing to walk with us
 
03:45:44.590 --> 03:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
hand inand to pull something like this
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
off is is probably one of the the most
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
complimentary things that you could have
 
03:45:52.149 --> 03:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
in this business that you know they they
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're acknowledging that something
 
03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be done in this world to
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
message that out so um I know that was
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
the long way around to the answer to
 
03:46:04.990 --> 03:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
your question but um I I think it is
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate where where it would be or
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
where his mindset is could it change
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
we just talked about this in the amount
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
of time that it took me to drive from
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
store Street to this building so uh
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of forethought
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
put into this and there's going to be a
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
lot of uh um thought put into how this
 
03:46:30.189 --> 03:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
concept could be um could be built um
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
with with the commission's input and IND
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
industry's input and let's not forget
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
the people that make the commercials
 
03:46:38.790 --> 03:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
themselves they they're going to have
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
input so um it's it was exciting for me
 
03:46:46.030 --> 03:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest about it uh when I
 
03:46:48.790 --> 03:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
was told and and I I was actually
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
looking forward to pushing this message
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
to all of you um it doesn't happen often
 
03:46:56.189 --> 03:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
so just quick followup okay follow up I
 
03:46:58.030 --> 03:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
just want I I assume it would be a good
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
idea to have a phone number or something
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
where people could call absolutely well
 
03:47:04.830 --> 03:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
the the 988 number would be at the end
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the day we want to be teaching 988
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
that's the it will incorporate all the
 
03:47:11.309 --> 03:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
represent all the material that the
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative pushed forward that
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
should be on whatever it was a flyer a
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
receipt whatever it was this in that
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
information would be pushed to this
 
03:47:23.790 --> 03:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
commercial okay representative spear has
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
another qu what yeah
 
03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I I kind of think the
 
03:47:31.830 --> 03:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
video is a good idea because it catches
 
03:47:33.309 --> 03:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
people's eyes a lot more than what's
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
written on a receipt which we tend to
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
throw away so I think that part is good
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
and the payment for this the money that
 
03:47:41.590 --> 03:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to take to invest in this is
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
going to be considerably more than
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
$440,000 so that's all going to be
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
covered by The Producers a NAA Grant so
 
03:47:51.149 --> 03:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
through our uh National entity that
 
03:47:54.030 --> 03:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
we're part of uh that we Grant get grant
 
03:47:56.429 --> 03:47:56.439 align:start position:0%
funding with quite often on on
 
03:47:58.149 --> 03:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we do whether it's
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement or the commission as a whole
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
um uh they are the basis for our
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
education platform um our driving
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
simulators all come from from
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
Napa okay so representative post did you
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
have your hand
 
03:48:18.750 --> 03:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
up thank you very much um thank you for
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
being here today um with the virtual
 
03:48:24.990 --> 03:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
boards are they in every liquor store
 
03:48:29.070 --> 03:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
already and it can be used for this
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
commercial there's actually thank you
 
03:48:32.429 --> 03:48:32.439 align:start position:0%
for your question representative there's
 
03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
actually multiple uh let's call them
 
03:48:35.159 --> 03:48:36.229 align:start position:0%
actually multiple uh let's call them
telit

03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
telit
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
monitors um I don't know the exact size
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
of them I think their 50 plus inch that
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
hang from the ceilings I know most of
 
03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
the stores if not all of them that have
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
been updated to the
 
03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
outlet uh model um have them in the Far
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
Corners and in the front of the
 
03:48:58.110 --> 03:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
stores um they're hard to miss on the
 
03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
second other side of it they get in the
 
03:49:03.550 --> 03:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
way of my cameras also every once in a
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
while uh uh when we're looking at loss
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
prevention uh but it's placement that
 
03:49:11.469 --> 03:49:11.479 align:start position:0%
they're they're there and they're very
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the in the
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
stores thank you
 
03:49:19.309 --> 03:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
represent thank you just a question on
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
um the frequency of the video playing is
 
03:49:24.070 --> 03:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
it a continuous loop or is it it's a
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
loop yes good question same is the same
 
03:49:27.990 --> 03:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
video playing over and over again or
 
03:49:30.670 --> 03:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
multiple yes so that would just jump
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
into the loop um the loop I think if the
 
03:49:35.950 --> 03:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
if I remember what the chairman told me
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
5 to 10 minute Loop uh but it could have
 
03:49:41.070 --> 03:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
happen as you know virtual it could
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
happen more often or less
 
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
frequently representative
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh what happens if you
 
03:49:53.030 --> 03:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
apply for that nap to Grant but you
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't get the
 
03:49:58.349 --> 03:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
grant uh we have our Napa Grant through
 
03:50:00.149 --> 03:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
education is
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
yearly um we we put in for it we get it
 
03:50:07.189 --> 03:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
so I don't great question representative
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't foresee that
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
occurring navka is a entity that like us
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
wants to get the message out there
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
especially in the world of education so
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
we look at this as an educational
 
03:50:25.110 --> 03:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
Endeavor um and pushing it out is is not
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
problem great thank you thank
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
you uh so representative tur I'll let
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.239 --> 03:50:50.469 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
so that that was a left turn for sure um
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
in in my uh in my formulation of this
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
while I was trying to minimize things
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of a professionally shot video
 
03:51:04.469 --> 03:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
never crossed my mind so um certainly
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
that sounds like it has great great
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
promise and I'm really excited to hear
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the chair
 
03:51:12.269 --> 03:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
um chairman Malik um and the Liquor
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
Commission is is committed to to to the
 
03:51:19.189 --> 03:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
concept um I two thoughts one is I I
 
03:51:20.910 --> 03:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
would really hope in the mix of who's
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to produce that video that
 
03:51:26.910 --> 03:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS um and the the the people at the
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau of drug and alcohol services are
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
integrally involved because they they
 
03:51:33.309 --> 03:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
know the science of social messaging
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
that needs to be built in into that that
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
video so that was one thought um and uh
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I ju Just just my one last
 
03:51:44.590 --> 03:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
pitch for you know both rather than
 
03:51:47.389 --> 03:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
either um you know the the value of the
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
receipts I agree most of them will be
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
thrown away um the thing about receipts
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
is they go home with a lot of people
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
even if they go home in in you know the
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
bottom of a bag or or crumpled up
 
03:52:00.189 --> 03:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
foreman and it's not just the consumer
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to reach it's their
 
03:52:03.469 --> 03:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
family it's their friends it's somebody
 
03:52:05.229 --> 03:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
that would see those questions and say
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
hey these sound like you maybe you
 
03:52:10.269 --> 03:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
should think about this um so that that
 
03:52:12.389 --> 03:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
was it and I'll just I'll just say again
 
03:52:14.309 --> 03:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
whether this goes forward in a in a
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislative way or not a legislative way
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm in happy to hear it it it's
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
going to go forward um I I will just
 
03:52:25.429 --> 03:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
point out the last the last line of the
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
amendment which which was originally um
 
03:52:30.910 --> 03:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um it says the content
 
03:52:32.910 --> 03:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
developed under this paragraph may also
 
03:52:35.510 --> 03:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
be reformatted and distributed by The
 
03:52:37.710 --> 03:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission via any other print
 
03:52:40.750 --> 03:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
signage and or El ronic means and to any
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
other group of recipients that the
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
commission may deem appropriate and that
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
was something that actually came out of
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
a a discussion with Aiden Moore and I
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
while we were um considering this as an
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
LSR that that if the content were
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
developed it would be good to go on a
 
03:52:59.070 --> 03:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
website it would be good to go on a you
 
03:53:02.030 --> 03:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
know uh to other PE other groups that
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
might want it even if if they weren't
 
03:53:05.790 --> 03:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
the liquor commissions and and like I
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
said not not never crossed my mind that
 
03:53:10.229 --> 03:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
one of those elic formats could be a
 
03:53:14.070 --> 03:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
video so um that's that's my okay great
 
03:53:18.229 --> 03:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you all right um any discussion
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%

03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion from the
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
okay I commend The Liquor Commission I'm
 
03:53:54.389 --> 03:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this bill and uh I think
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's the way to go I think you know
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
putting it on the um uh receipt the uh
 
03:54:02.110 --> 03:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
receipt that we get from the cashier I
 
03:54:03.550 --> 03:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be pretty much
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
useless so I think this is huge and uh I
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the uh effort
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
from the commission great all right so
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative bullo second by
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%

03:54:22.429 --> 03:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
study any discussion on the
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
motion seeing none all those in favor
 
03:54:24.960 --> 03:54:26.309 align:start position:0%
motion seeing none all those in favor
say

03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:54:28.389 --> 03:54:28.399 align:start position:0%
I those
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
opposed so moved unanimously here's the
 
03:54:38.910 --> 03:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
list okay uh before I move on since I
 
03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
have a room full of canopis
 
03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
people stay tuned for this one you will
 
03:54:51.790 --> 03:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
someday if they if we end up going
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
Cannabis stores if we end up doing this
 
03:55:01.149 --> 03:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
model we just then we'll end up asking
 
03:55:02.750 --> 03:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
them to
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
ad

03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
She's Too Tall okay I will close that
 
03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we'll now move on to
 
03:55:24.429 --> 03:55:24.439 align:start position:0%
our last
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay so
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
now I think we gave you plenty of time
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
there huh yes you did thank
 
03:55:35.710 --> 03:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
you I would have sent this out earlier
 
03:55:37.710 --> 03:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
however I was just making sure all of
 
03:55:39.110 --> 03:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
the changes that I wanted wanted to make
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
sure we're in this amendment we're in
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
fact there and I needed to look at it so
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
I could tell you which page so you
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
weren't flipping through with me um so
 
03:55:48.670 --> 03:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
last week one of the biggest and sort of
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
biggest most surprising conversations
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
was on the data collection uh because we
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
had some friends from the Department of
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
Safety who found out that they were
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
involved in this process for years and
 
03:55:59.790 --> 03:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
years but had not been made aware
 
03:56:02.349 --> 03:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
because this is a massive Bill the
 
03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:56:06.269 --> 03:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
led by Mike Hol looked at it looked at
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
the possibilities and gave us language
 
03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page 30 so I'll give you
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
a minute to flip
 
03:56:16.110 --> 03:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
there it'll be down towards the bottom
 
03:56:19.149 --> 03:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
lines 27 through
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
36 I'll wait till I don't hear the paper
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
flipping so that I can read along so
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
everybody can
 
03:56:28.510 --> 03:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
hear okay so we see that Department of
 
03:56:30.990 --> 03:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services shall yes so
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
now it's not later than two years after
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this chapter and
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
every two years thereafter the
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
shall wear a appropriate enter into
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
memorandums of understanding with the
 
03:56:43.149 --> 03:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety the Department of
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
Justice the Department of Education the
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
commission and any other agency
 
03:56:48.830 --> 03:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
determined by the Department of Health
 
03:56:50.910 --> 03:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to possess relevant
 
03:56:53.269 --> 03:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
data to collect data and produce and
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
publish a report that includes Baseline
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
data and the most current data regarding
 
03:56:59.229 --> 03:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
the Health and Welfare outcomes before
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
and after cannibis legalization and
 
03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
regulation for adult use all the DAT all
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
data in the report shall be
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
non-identifiable and respectful of
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
personal privacy this report may be
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
combined with the report um that's
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise required for substance use
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and Recovery um
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
that is allocated through one of the
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
funds established in this um it also has
 
03:57:20.910 --> 03:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
some Appropriations and some other
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
language in order to actually enable it
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
so those amendments are in here but I
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't think I need to point you to page
 
03:57:29.389 --> 03:57:29.399 align:start position:0%
37 for that um with that I guess I guess
 
03:57:30.750 --> 03:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
my question would be if you want to wait
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
and see if there's any questions for my
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
cult or if that seems that that would be
 
03:57:35.790 --> 03:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
a good way to move forward on that
 
03:57:38.349 --> 03:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
language sounds good then let's keep on
 
03:57:38.359 --> 03:57:39.469 align:start position:0%
language sounds good then let's keep on
rolling

03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
rolling
 
03:57:41.469 --> 03:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I'm an economist I make
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
bad puns I
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
apologize um so we'll move to public
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
consumption on page
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
seven um there's been a very big push to
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that um at some point there is
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
more than just a violation for public
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
smoking um so the language that has been
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
floated by just about everybody would be
 
03:58:06.790 --> 03:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
that after the third um a third or
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
additional time and having two prior
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
convictions within the 5 years of the
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
third or subsequent offense that it' be
 
03:58:16.030 --> 03:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor um I didn't see
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
that they left out that it should be a
 
03:58:19.790 --> 03:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor because I think it
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
would make sense to not have jail time
 
03:58:23.309 --> 03:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
on it um maybe if you want to add
 
03:58:24.990 --> 03:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
another enhancement but at a certain
 
03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
point at a certain point when we have PR
 
03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
bail and everything else how much do we
 
03:58:30.910 --> 03:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
need to be pushing that we need to make
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
sure we have the sledgehammer but we
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
also need to not build in a huge
 
03:58:36.189 --> 03:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy that's going to be more than
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
we need and that's something that we'll
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
have time to work on if we see that
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are repeat offenders getting
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
multiple Class B misdemeanors that'd be
 
03:58:46.510 --> 03:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
a good reason to have another law to
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
further strengthen it but I think at
 
03:58:50.710 --> 03:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
this point um hopefully that goes far
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
enough for everybody involved for those
 
03:58:54.750 --> 03:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
penalties without going too far for the
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
civil liberties folks and the good news
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
that won't come to this committee
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
correct correct so even a better reason
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
to pass that one off
 
03:59:07.189 --> 03:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
sorry um okay and then now we get to The
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
Possession limits um been the concern
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
raised it's on page 34 so this is around
 
03:59:16.349 --> 03:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
the annulment and um throughout it it
 
03:59:18.670 --> 03:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
had a bunch of language about about
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
annulling based on The Possession limit
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
so adding into the definition of
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
possession limit that it's the current
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
possession limit as defined in the
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
definitions of the bill um I think it's
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
a good way to make sure that it's
 
03:59:32.189 --> 03:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
there's no malicious compliance I don't
 
03:59:34.149 --> 03:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
expect that of anybody today but let's
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
do the belt and suspenders and make sure
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
our language is clear and then um one of
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
the last issues and actually is probably
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
one of the underpinning issues about how
 
03:59:45.830 --> 03:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure this out whether
 
03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
it is these um retail outlets or a
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
franchise model the whole point is to
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the government is not
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing who's going to make
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
a fortune in this that is our biggest
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
concern and that's why some of our
 
04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
friends are coming at this and looking
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
at it as a franchise model in order to
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
limit that opportunity right now I don't
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
think their language sufficent I meets
 
04:00:10.670 --> 04:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
those limits and makes sure that
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
somebody's not going to be able to build
 
04:00:14.110 --> 04:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
a huge fortune and then build a mode
 
04:00:17.870 --> 04:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
around it um and the limit on 15 stores
 
04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
quite frankly creates a lot of that
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
incentive um the question is when would
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
it make sense to increase the number of
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
stores if you turn to page
 
04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
12 that is the section that talks about
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
the number of stores that we would have
 
04:00:35.790 --> 04:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
and um that would add when they
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
determine whether to increase the number
 
04:00:40.269 --> 04:00:40.279 align:start position:0%
of cannabis retail outlets and if so by
 
04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
how many one of the goals would be
 
04:00:44.790 --> 04:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
licensing sufficient cannabis Outlets to
 
04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
avoid a second secondary market for the
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
transfer or sale of cannabis retail
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
outlet licenses one such indicator of a
 
04:00:54.309 --> 04:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
secondary Market would be an increase in
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
the intrinsic market value of a cannabis
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
retail outlet beyond the premium
 
04:01:00.189 --> 04:01:00.199 align:start position:0%
reasonably attributed to eliminating the
 
04:01:01.910 --> 04:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
time and compliance steps required to
 
04:01:01.920 --> 04:01:02.870 align:start position:0%
time and compliance steps required to
obtain

04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
04:01:05.389 --> 04:01:05.399 align:start position:0%
ler fortunately this is a committee I
 
04:01:06.750 --> 04:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
actually can say that in front of
 
04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
because you're Commerce and you deal
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
with economic issues uh the question
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
would be if there's other ways to um to
 
04:01:16.990 --> 04:01:17.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how we're going to make sure
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we're not building an OT around
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
somebody's highly profitable exchange um
 
04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
now that we've gotten closer to the wire
 
04:01:25.710 --> 04:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
I've had some more discussions with
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
people involved in this and there may be
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
a way where we can get we can have more
 
04:01:31.870 --> 04:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
people that aren't walking away sad when
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
we come from our discussion so I'd
 
04:01:35.429 --> 04:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
actually like to be able to have a
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to see if we can
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
get even more people onard board I know
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
that right now this has some pretty
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
broad support but let's see how much
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
broader we can build the support so I
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
think that we might be able to do that
 
04:01:48.389 --> 04:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
and find a way to make sure that we are
 
04:01:50.830 --> 04:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
not handing people a pile of cash with
 
04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
the state stamp on it while also
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
protecting people making sure that the
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate regulation is there this
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill as amended already meets all except
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
one of the governor's requirements and
 
04:02:04.110 --> 04:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
the one it doesn't meet is the
 
04:02:06.910 --> 04:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
restriction on the lobbying and campaign
 
04:02:09.309 --> 04:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
donations a lot of that is around I
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
believe is around the fear that we could
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
be creating a castle full of money with
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
a mode around it and if we're able to
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
figure out how to not do that and to
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
structure this in a way where we're not
 
04:02:23.309 --> 04:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
picking the winners then that becomes
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
less necessary um as I reviewed a draft
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
from some you know people on the other
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
side the other body um they also didn't
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
have that language on the lobbying and
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions when I saw the
 
04:02:37.910 --> 04:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
most recent version so this is an idea
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
where we're all just trying to make sure
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
that that we're not picking winners and
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
losers here um and one of the other
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
things that I would note is that as I
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
was reviewing I've been trying to meet
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
with the governor I've been going by his
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
office every day I want to know where
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
his mind is at on this because you guys
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
have been working on this diligently for
 
04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
years and years and years and I'm
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we can finally get to
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
something that passes and has as few
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
people sad and as many people happy as
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
possible when we finally get there so
 
04:03:10.149 --> 04:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to speak to him but in the
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
absence of that I searched for any of
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
his comments and the only thing I could
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
find on him talking about a franchise
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
model was he said that he'd consider a
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
franchise model but the details matter
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly I agree the details
 
04:03:25.469 --> 04:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
are what matter and um that's why I'm
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
hopeful I can keep working on this if he
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
can give me another week I think we've
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
gone pretty far from where we
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
started okay representative Herbert has
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
a question um wouldn't it be
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
truthful that uh out absent a franchise
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
model which is a private one that uh the
 
04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
issue of uh uh donations and political
 
04:03:54.110 --> 04:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
donations etc etc etc are pretty much uh
 
04:03:56.830 --> 04:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
non non-event because the state is
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
getting the has the stores and uh are is
 
04:04:02.790 --> 04:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
doing the business as as is the case
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
today um quite frankly thank you for the
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
question I actually struggle finding any
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional way to limit that the
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
lobbying and the Contra the campaign
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
contributions um I think it's more just
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
an indication of the symptom um and I
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
figure if we can get to the underly it's
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
more of a symptom if we can get to the
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
underlying disease about picking winners
 
04:04:26.110 --> 04:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
and losers then it becomes a mood issue
 
04:04:28.990 --> 04:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
but I agree um that I agree that moving
 
04:04:31.229 --> 04:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
to private business that that becomes
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
less of an issue as moving to a moving
 
04:04:36.590 --> 04:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
back to a liquor store model would also
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
remove that because state employees and
 
04:04:40.590 --> 04:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
state agencies can testify on on
 
04:04:42.309 --> 04:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
anything it's part of their right of
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
free speech so it gets into that weird
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
gray area with franchises which is yet
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
another one of the reasons why I want to
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
make sure we're in really really
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
cautious if we end up down that path so
 
04:04:53.319 --> 04:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
cautious if we end up down that path so
thank

04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
you yes representative San so see the
 
04:05:02.149 --> 04:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
language here we've talked about this as
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
you know so I'm just curious what made
 
04:05:05.710 --> 04:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
you not want to put in like a firm
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
number that would be approved
 
04:05:08.399 --> 04:05:08.990 align:start position:0%
number that would be approved
I

04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:05:11.950 --> 04:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
mean I don't get it so my concern with
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
having a fir firm number that's the
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
Baseline to be approved is that that
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
also then may be seen as um something
 
04:05:20.349 --> 04:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to go beyond so
 
04:05:22.110 --> 04:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
if you had three more stores every three
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
years but the market actually suggested
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
you should have three every year if you
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
have somebody that as a regulator is
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
trying to be more conservative about how
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's rolled off out or more cautious as
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's rolled out they may take that three
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
instead of three or more to heart so
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's why why I'm concerned about
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
basically you know it's anchoring so if
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
you say that it would be three but let's
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
say our market clearing it would be
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
similar to Lakers stores with 65 to 67
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
stores if there's an anchoring to the
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
idea of only having three every three
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
years or five every year whatever number
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
it is I'm afraid that that'll anchor the
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
decisions as opposed to having a more
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
holistic look at it so what would be the
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
process for for like I know you don't
 
04:06:06.070 --> 04:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
Define it in here but what if you could
 
04:06:07.550 --> 04:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
Define it how would you define what the
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
proc processes to decide what the market
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
looks like so if three is too small it
 
04:06:14.590 --> 04:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
probably is if we're starting with 15 it
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
would take us forever to get to whatever
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
the liquor numbers are probably we need
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
to go beyond that I'm guessing just
 
04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be smaller type
 
04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
stores but what would what would be the
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
process that you would see playing out
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
if you were in charge of Designing it I
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
know you're not I know the build doesn't
 
04:06:30.189 --> 04:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
do that but I just want to hear what
 
04:06:32.110 --> 04:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
you're thinking on it well so when you
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
look at it you're going to look at the
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
model of the retail outlet if the retail
 
04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
outlet were to be more more of you know
 
04:06:41.149 --> 04:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
a Costco where they're Distributing with
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
low margins and keeping overhead low um
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they have a specific process that
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
they're going through they have a
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
certain amount of understood costs and
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and they're they're passing it
 
04:06:54.830 --> 04:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
through at a very low markup then
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's not as much profit in those
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
stores so you're going to get an idea
 
04:07:01.149 --> 04:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
based on sales traffic and the volume
 
04:07:03.389 --> 04:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
looking to see if it see how it's going
 
04:07:05.469 --> 04:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
you'd also look to see if it seems that
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have pulled the New Hampshire Market
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
back into new Hampshire as opposed to
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
having continue people continue to cross
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
the border I mean when you look at the B
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
border towns choosing between a Market
 
04:07:17.110 --> 04:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
Basket in Massachusetts in New Hampshire
 
04:07:19.790 --> 04:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
is less of a big deal um although
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's some of the tax issue but
 
04:07:22.590 --> 04:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes you get a greater selection in
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and it would be higher
 
04:07:26.790 --> 04:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
taxed in other states but I you'd want
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um you're looking at
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
all these aspects if you have one where
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
they where there's U no no nothing to
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
set what they're Char charging nothing
 
04:07:39.389 --> 04:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
to set what's going on in this
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
government created Monopoly if you have
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
no limits on it and they're charging a
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
huge markup because they're the only
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
only store in town then that would be
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
another indicator that we would need to
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
have more stores the other one would be
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
the one that's laid out here saying that
 
04:07:56.750 --> 04:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
um saying that basically if these are
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
going at an extra premium I mean you
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
have taxi medallions in New York City
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
where they're trading at a huge premium
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
and literally you've invested in your
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
retirement because when you're done you
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
sell it to somebody else and now you
 
04:08:09.309 --> 04:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
don't need to make the money because
 
04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
that intrinsic value of The Limited
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
scarce scarce taxi Medallion is your
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
value so we want to make sure we're
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
avoiding it so this language only
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
prevents the taxi Medallion issue and so
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's why digging into the idea of
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure it's attractive
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
enough for people to participate but in
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
a capitated market where there's only 15
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
stores you would need to have more
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
constraints on it so that you're not
 
04:08:32.830 --> 04:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
building up your money castle with your
 
04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
moat and swimming in it like Scrooge
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
McDuck um and I think that that's why I
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
would would like to be able to take a
 
04:08:40.670 --> 04:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
look at it and now that I can better
 
04:08:42.990 --> 04:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
understand some of where the proponents
 
04:08:44.910 --> 04:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the franchise model are coming from
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
and what they think that their model
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
will do not what I see on paper with
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
their model but what they think it'll do
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
we may be able to find some way where
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
where it'll be easier to find a market
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
clearing price but that's a problem with
 
04:09:00.149 --> 04:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
controlling anything that should be free
 
04:09:02.070 --> 04:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
market right none of us know how to
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
determine that but um we can also look
 
04:09:06.109 --> 04:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
at the factors do you
 
04:09:08.670 --> 04:09:08.680 align:start position:0%
think I mean it's hard to do and it
 
04:09:10.750 --> 04:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
could be almost like a shell game but do
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
you think
 
04:09:12.399 --> 04:09:14.670 align:start position:0%
you think
having

04:09:14.670 --> 04:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
non-transferable uh licenses or the
 
04:09:18.510 --> 04:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
we'll just call it medallion for the
 
04:09:21.990 --> 04:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
sake of that so we have Medallion um
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's tied to me if I open up the
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
store and then if I somehow I'm not
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
involved in that business I know there
 
04:09:28.349 --> 04:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
are loopholes there are loopholes what
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is creating loopholes but I'm
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
say do you think that would be in any
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
way effective to to prevent to prevent
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
the rent seeking that's going to come
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
from from medallions The Medallion
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
system that we're essentially creating
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
well I think a lot of it's looking at
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
how different different different uh
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
businesses have done this if you look at
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
Chick-fil-A um you're an operator not a
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
franchisee when you're at Chick-fil-A so
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
you can make you make a certain amount
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
at Chick-fil-A you'll make about
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
$200,000 operating a store but you don't
 
04:10:00.189 --> 04:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
have transfer rights to that so you
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
can't transfer that to anybody else so
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's one of those that's a more
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
accessible franchise because you don't
 
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
really need much money down
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
but you're able to operate it here we
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want the state building out the
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
stores so you need to look at the the
 
04:10:14.910 --> 04:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
whole angle and you need to look at the
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
process but in order to allow for the um
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
Capital needs and Capital Improvements
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
and the operational costs there's going
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
to have to be some balance in it but you
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
also need to make sure that that when
 
04:10:29.109 --> 04:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
you're setting this up you know you're
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
not creating that rent syncing you're
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
not creating these sorry we're getting
 
04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
into econ talk because it's economists
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
talking here but it's it's really
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
crucial to make sure that what we set up
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
you maybe it's a matter of Manufacturers
 
04:10:43.109 --> 04:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
Su suggested the state state markup some
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
way that we can have it so that it
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't get out of hand and that once we
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
know what market clearing is we can pull
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
back those proxies for the free market
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
because if we end up having whatever the
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
right number of stores is then you don't
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
need to have those limits on it and it
 
04:11:01.469 --> 04:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
would be inappropriate to keep a certain
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
markup to be the Costco where you have
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
8% off after costs so how how how would
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
we inval uh if we're going to allow
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
transfer that means so so you're saying
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
right now you are a proponent of
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
transfer of
 
04:11:16.750 --> 04:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
licenses I I'm saying it all depends how
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
the whole cake is baked um it's just
 
04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very complex issue and I
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to lock myself in one way or
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
the other I'll be locked in by next week
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
on what I do but um knowing that there's
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time and I have more
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the understanding of what the
 
04:11:31.630 --> 04:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
proponents of the franchise model are
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve we may be able to
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
reach something that works right and
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
then in terms of like who will be in
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
charge of so you kind of laid out what
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
you would do if you were in charge of
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
this we'll call it a board that reviews
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
every few years whether or not the what
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
the market clearing rate should be
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
um is that just going to be in rule
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
making we're going to decide who's on it
 
04:11:59.550 --> 04:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
is that g to be in rule I mean should
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
should we have some language in that
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
excludes any current
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
operators uh I mean I'm I'm just I don't
 
04:12:06.630 --> 04:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
really know I haven't thought about it
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
until right now but I'm just thinking
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
about uh you know the previous language
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
we had spoke about where it's no less
 
04:12:16.109 --> 04:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
than some number then you know that
 
04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's some guaranteed amount but there
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
was still some sort of board involved
 
04:12:20.670 --> 04:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
but I I never really thought too much
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
about the board because the number was
 
04:12:24.670 --> 04:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
built in which gave me some comfort so
 
04:12:26.349 --> 04:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
what is this process for coming up with
 
04:12:27.550 --> 04:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
the board I mean should that be spelled
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
out here because Ru making feels like
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's a potential opportunity for the
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
industry to capture um with the
 
04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
structure of that um so that actually
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
brings up a really good point because
 
04:12:39.750 --> 04:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
the general cannabis Advisory Board
 
04:12:41.109 --> 04:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
should have those people who are
 
04:12:43.030 --> 04:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
involved in it as well because some of
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
this process you want to make sure that
 
04:12:46.710 --> 04:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
people involved in the industry can help
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
have an but if you had the Cannabis
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
transfer Advisory Board I know the last
 
04:12:55.109 --> 04:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
thing you want is more boards but if you
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
had a group of people who could be the
 
04:12:59.229 --> 04:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
ones that made an assessment um looking
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
at people who were involved in business
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
looking I can talk with you and try and
 
04:13:03.990 --> 04:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
figure out who might be able to get a
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
better look at what would help
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
facilitate Market um but I think the
 
04:13:11.550 --> 04:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
idea of potentially making that separate
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
or a designated subset of the canid VIS
 
04:13:17.070 --> 04:13:17.080 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board um has a lot of Promise
 
04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
because you're right if you're advising
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
on one topic you're not necessarily the
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
right people to advise on the other yeah
 
04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm sympathetic to the anchoring
 
04:13:27.550 --> 04:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
idea and I'm curious to see where this
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
goes and happy to work with you offline
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
but I think this language does
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
not this language doesn't really
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
Safeguard against
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
medallions being created as of right now
 
04:13:42.910 --> 04:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
I I think the language of it is great
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
but like the devil is always in the
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
details and I think the detail that
 
04:13:48.670 --> 04:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be fleshed out is are the
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be owning these
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
licenses going to be involved in the
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
process of deciding whether not they
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
want to approve more competition or not
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
like that's fundamentally what we're
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
talking about here is I own a business
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
are you going to ask me if I want
 
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
competition I'm always going to say no
 
04:14:03.349 --> 04:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
and if they're somehow involved in that
 
04:14:05.429 --> 04:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
process or they're not even at Arms
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
lengths you know like like it
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I get nervous about not
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
having the the number that would anchor
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
which is a very fair concern but um that
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
is I know you understand what I'm saying
 
04:14:17.950 --> 04:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
I I know you know where I'm going with
 
04:14:19.550 --> 04:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
this so well and the other issue with
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
that too is that you're right until
 
04:14:23.309 --> 04:14:23.319 align:start position:0%
there's actually an offer until somebody
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
is offering one of these for sale you
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
can't see if there is a premium because
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
if all 15 um under this model um I think
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have that you can own three I'm not
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
sure there's I some of the details I I
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
my eyes are glazing over between the
 
04:14:40.469 --> 04:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
different models I've I've seen one of
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
the franchise that's limiting to three
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
of the fac of the retail outlets another
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's limiting somebody to five so if
 
04:14:48.630 --> 04:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
you had that and you had three different
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
Market groups that each had five when
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
are they going to put something on the
 
04:14:53.710 --> 04:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
market if they already have a good thing
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
going so you're right you wouldn't have
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
that transparency if there's nothing
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
actually offered for sale so this was an
 
04:15:01.389 --> 04:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
attempt to move towards that that's why
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out and give me another
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
week would be helpful but I love having
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
these um ideas brought out in the open
 
04:15:08.590 --> 04:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
because these are the things that
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
everybody's been grappling with because
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
the state the pure state run model
 
04:15:14.349 --> 04:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
avoids those but then you have the plant
 
04:15:16.590 --> 04:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
touching issue the franchise model
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
depending on how it's set up if you have
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
a heavy enough hand and there's really
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
no profit to be made in the stores then
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's somebody who just wants to operate
 
04:15:27.870 --> 04:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
a store because they just want to run
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
run the local operation but there's not
 
04:15:33.109 --> 04:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
much upside to them then again why would
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
they invest in the store if there's not
 
04:15:36.990 --> 04:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
enough upside to cover that you move to
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
an agency one and then that's why we're
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out about the transfer
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
price and if you had free market we
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be here but that won't
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
get signed into law so all right thanks
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's the hand we're dealt okay so you
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
know who you need to talk to this week
 
04:15:52.109 --> 04:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
to I've talking on that yes we'll
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
continue talking okay representa buo
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I have
 
04:15:58.600 --> 04:15:59.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I have
a

04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
concern with cassino owners owning a
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis outlet and I don't know if
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
there's you know
 
04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
I have many reasons but um it probably
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
can't be included in this bill I don't
 
04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
want to jeopardize this bill but I just
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
want everybody in this room to know that
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
I do not think a casino owner should own
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
a cannabis
 
04:16:27.830 --> 04:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
store thanks no sin
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
spear thank you this is a question gared
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
towards uh you rep represent ative hunt
 
04:16:37.760 --> 04:16:39.750 align:start position:0%

chairman

04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:16:42.750 --> 04:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
hunt last night at some point you sent
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
us out another yet another
 
04:16:49.469 --> 04:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
amendment what was the purpose of
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
that uh and it's one we've seen before
 
04:16:55.950 --> 04:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
hate why did you send it uh because
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
Senator abbis asked me
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
to are we supposed to do anything with
 
04:17:09.870 --> 04:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
it uh it's a purely a discussion point
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
but I would
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
say um you never know what happens on
 
04:17:20.550 --> 04:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
know okay yes
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
W uh there was a a commission a cannabis
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
commission over the summer and I believe
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
you correct do we have a copy of that so
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
that what you got from Senator abbis
 
04:17:39.389 --> 04:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
last night oh okay for all Ted purposes
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
he was the chairman of the commission
 
04:17:44.469 --> 04:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
okay and in that was a question about
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
you the atc's and every everything you
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
ever wanted to know about the commission
 
04:17:53.070 --> 04:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
has been been explained and that would
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
be if if there was a commission report
 
04:17:56.359 --> 04:17:58.149 align:start position:0%
be if if there was a commission report
that's

04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
it so there there was no official
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
commission report that is correct okay
 
04:18:02.560 --> 04:18:04.429 align:start position:0%
commission report that is correct okay
thank

04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Bros he this may be a
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
loaded question but how to put this
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
politically correct way um why does a
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
certain Senator want to blow up what has
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
been worked on by you know infinite
 
04:18:21.950 --> 04:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
number of people and have come to
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
something that seems like it's 99% of
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
what the governor wants why is there a
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
desire to blow this up at this date
 
04:18:29.199 --> 04:18:30.429 align:start position:0%

of advertising and education campaign is

already covered in the educational
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
language in here but I'll take a look at
 
04:19:40.510 --> 04:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
that okay great so in terms of the
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee do you have a preference
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
between Monday and Tuesday morning or
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon um I'm currently open
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
as to that I don't know when my other
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
pending bills are scheduled but I'll
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
you okay okay great thank you and thank
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
you all for coming to visit us uh for
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
the committee um so uh tomorrow tomorrow
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
we have our last three bills for our
 
04:20:09.479 --> 04:20:10.510 align:start position:0%
we have our last three bills for our
public

04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
hearing and I know how much you all love
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process but time to
 
04:20:17.469 --> 04:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
move on to the next
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
stage um so uh terms of next week I will
 
04:20:21.439 --> 04:20:23.309 align:start position:0%
stage um so uh terms of next week I will
schedule

04:20:23.309 --> 04:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
04:20:25.149 --> 04:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittees um and obviously the
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
liquor subcommittee will be meeting so
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
I'll start scheduling some of the other
 
04:20:31.710 --> 04:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
liquor bills um and then we have of
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
course we have the business is got the
 
04:20:37.590 --> 04:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
Lion Share of the bills and and and then
 
04:20:39.990 --> 04:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
insurance does have something we'll be
 
04:20:43.389 --> 04:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
hearing the insurance uh tomorrow and we
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
did hear Insurance already um so but
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows going forward um
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
that keeps us busy for next week and if
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
I look at my calendar properly here um
 
04:21:01.870 --> 04:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
and then the following week will be uh
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
subcomittees and uh right well so next
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to do we have the Tuesday
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
Wednesday will exact um so we'll have
 
04:21:12.670 --> 04:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
I'll try to put in bills for
 
04:21:15.189 --> 04:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
Tuesday that are look like they're easy
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
then we could exec them on the 14th
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
along with this one so it doesn't look
 
04:21:21.229 --> 04:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
like we're only around executing one
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill um session on the 15th the
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
following days the 20th and 21st we'll
 
04:21:30.550 --> 04:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
probably do the same similar situation
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then we have vacation week and yes I
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
will be out of the country so do not
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
think you're going to say say anything
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
to me while I'm away in the Caribbean
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
and um and then uh come back to to
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
March and uh which will then
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
um uh we have according to
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
what according to I yeah there's always
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
a question whether and and it's it's
 
04:21:59.710 --> 04:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunate I can't tell you the answer
 
04:22:02.109 --> 04:22:02.119 align:start position:0%
whether we would get a a second
 
04:22:02.119 --> 04:22:03.510 align:start position:0%
whether we would get a a second
committee

04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
bill um normally historically we never
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
have gotten a second committee Bill
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
until Terry narelli started doing it and
 
04:22:14.910 --> 04:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
Bill oine did so we have had in the past
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
we have had second committees but not
 
04:22:21.429 --> 04:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
withstanding that means um we have all
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
the way to the end of March so we have a
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
whole month to sub and exact everything
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
and then the last day to get everything
 
04:22:33.870 --> 04:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
out uh is March 28th so we're doing good
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
um I might be tempted to I don't know
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
change our schedule and only meet on
 
04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday rather than Tuesday Wednesday in
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the session Thursdays but we'll see
 
04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
how well we we we do um the the the same
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
problem still occurs that on Tuesdays
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're in a committee room we never
 
04:22:55.870 --> 04:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
know but isn't this cozy being in this
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
room here like I just this is just I
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
know 30 some years this is the way
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
commerce was always for
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
me you think it's too close no I'm
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
confused when I leave this room which
 
04:23:11.550 --> 04:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
way to go oh because we're oh right well
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
but imagine you know I want to go see
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
Carrie oh right well it's just I know
 
04:23:21.070 --> 04:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
cross the down the hall but in terms of
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of scheduling it will be
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
determined where how how well we do with
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
the other subcommittees I think most of
 
04:23:30.790 --> 04:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
the bills are pretty straightforward in
 
04:23:33.309 --> 04:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
terms of what we want to do with them
 
04:23:35.229 --> 04:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
but uh a fair amount of them do need
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendments if we're going to going to
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
pass them and uh we'll we'll get through
 
04:23:41.309 --> 04:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
that in the next couple weeks and and we
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to there's no pressure um uh
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
uh because tomorrow we'll have um 10 out
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the 11 bills that we had to get out
 
04:23:50.560 --> 04:23:51.349 align:start position:0%
of the 11 bills that we had to get out
of

04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee any questions from the commity
 
04:23:53.640 --> 04:23:54.670 align:start position:0%
committee any questions from the commity
members

04:23:54.670 --> 04:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
any comments about what days of the week
 
04:23:58.750 --> 04:23:58.760 align:start position:0%

04:24:01.229 --> 04:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
meet yeah I just have a preference
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
because I stay over for me it would be
 
04:24:05.309 --> 04:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
nice to have it Wednesday Thursday
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
