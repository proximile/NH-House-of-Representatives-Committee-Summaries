00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
good to go are you all set ken you're
 
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.830 align:start position:0%
good to go are you all set ken you're
ready

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay well i appreciate the time i think
 
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
what i'll do is um
 
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
i know it's a little awkward uh doing
 
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
things like this you guys are getting a
 
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
lot more used to it than probably even i
 
00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
am um and i don't want to be repetitive
 
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
i i hope everyone had at least had a
 
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
look at the initial budget presentation
 
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we did again
 
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know one of the hard parts about
 
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
doing it virtually is that you know
 
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
there with you know really presenting it
 
00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
on a one-on-one basis with the house but
 
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
what we also try to do is show some
 
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
charts and graphs
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
because it really is uh talking about a
 
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 align:start position:0%
budget without showing any numbers is
 
00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
always a very challenging
 
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
thing so in some ways it created an
 
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to show some of the
 
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
things you want to highlight
 
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
and give a little historical perspective
 
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
on some of these numbers and
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
and some of the dynamics that we're
 
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
talking about so if you'll bear with me
 
00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to go through a few of these
 
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
things and then
 
00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's a few other things that we
 
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
didn't quite get to in the initial
 
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
budget presentation but are
 
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
worthwhile and no and uh worth noting
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
for a variety of different reasons but
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
what we really tried to do in the
 
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
initial presentation was really hit all
 
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
those high points all those things that
 
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the most part i we think can have
 
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
the biggest impact positive impact on
 
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
people's lives where we are
 
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
and the opportunities uh as we move
 
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
forward so
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
um if you'll bear with me um obviously
 
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
let's just start with with where we were
 
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and i don't you don't need the
 
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
governor to explain to you the
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
the really that all the challenges and
 
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
the pitfalls of of the last year
 
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
um they go well beyond just the economic
 
00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
impacts they go
 
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
to our communities and in society
 
00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
without a doubt one of the first things
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
we did you know
 
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
knowing how severe this was going to be
 
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
back in march and april of last year
 
00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
we knew that it was going to have a huge
 
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
economic impact whether it was just for
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
a few weeks a few months or even
 
00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
potentially longer
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
so when the economic impacts of the
 
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
pandem pandemic really undercut what at
 
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
the time was
 
00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh one of the strongest economies in the
 
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
state's history um
 
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 align:start position:0%
we did take very decisive action uh we
 
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
faced a lot of uncertainty and that can
 
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
be very scary
 
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
but it also means you have to step up
 
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
and and make some very tough decisions
 
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
the budget shortfall that we looked at
 
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
was predicted working with department of
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
revenue was
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
predicted anywhere between 350 and 400
 
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
by taking some the actions of both
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
managing expenses
 
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh instilling a hiring freeze um just
 
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
being i think tight on a lot of things
 
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
we even
 
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
pushed out a few of the capital projects
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
not because even if the ones we didn't
 
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
want to push out because there were no
 
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
workers people then you know it was hard
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
to get folks to actually
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
keep committing to those projects
 
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
because it was such an unknown future
 
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
but that also created
 
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to not have to expend
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
that cash until we really got a handle
 
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
on what was going to happen with our
 
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
economy and we were able over time
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
to really reduce that that hole if you
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
will to about a 50 million dollar
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh shortfall not a 350 million dollar
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
shortfall which is obviously a
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
a lot more manageable in a variety of
 
00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
different ways um
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the end education trust fund which again
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
no one has was really sure where that
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
was going to end up
 
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
but now it's projected to end the
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
biennium with a positive balance
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
the long-standing uh highway fund
 
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.589 align:start position:0%
the long-standing uh highway fund
deficit

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
deficit
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
has been substantially reduced and the
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
we saw a lot more people hunting and
 
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
fishing and getting their license and
 
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
recreating they were
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
spending their their uh either their
 
00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 align:start position:0%
what they were bringing home and pay
 
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be outside and be healthy
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of folks were getting
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment checks or whatever it was
 
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
the unemployment stipend
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to spend it in a way
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
that they could spend time with their
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
families outdoors and that has
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
really boosted um the fish and game fund
 
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
to really
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
levels we haven't seen in many many
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
years and all that
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
you know created opportunity for us
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
so putting all that opportunity in terms
 
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
of what we were managing through 2020
 
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.789 align:start position:0%
of what we were managing through 2020
together

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
allowed us to create a balanced budget
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and that's the most important thing is
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
truly balanced within itself we don't
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
use a cent of any sort of speculative
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
federal money not a penny of money that
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
voted on or spent or authorized out of
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
the federal government this budget
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
relies on not a penny of that i know
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about that up
 
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about that up
there

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not even an exaggeration
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
it's 100 percent
 
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
untrue so we really have a budget that
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
lives within its own means
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
it cuts taxes as a lot of folks have
 
00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
heard and no it increases
 
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
the municipal revenue sharing we always
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
talk about the fact that the state
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
cannot control
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
directly property taxes but what we can
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
do is send back cash
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
and send back opportunity that would
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
help offset otherwise
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
local costs and so this budget i think
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's a couple very creative things
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of allowing us to to do more
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
municipal revenue sharing
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
and also help hopefully make and
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
maintain that obligation of more
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
municipal revenue sharing
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
it downshifts nothing it really in terms
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
of burden
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost to those municipalities
 
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
we also include 30 million dollars in
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
one-time aid to schools for
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
capital investments infrastructure
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency projects whatever
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
the schools want we're really building
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
on that school infrastructure fund that
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
we created
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago specifically at the
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
time for safe school infrastructure and
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of money into that
 
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're keeping that same fund we're just
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
broadening the ability of local school
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
districts to use these
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
state matching grants for whatever they
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
they want in terms of capital projects
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
that one-time spending
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
which again really takes the burden off
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
some of the local districts allows
 
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.029 align:start position:0%
some of the local districts allows
districts

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
to do projects that they otherwise
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
weren't able to do in the past
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about the tax relief and
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a big one for me because
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
when i've spent a lot of time with
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
businesses over the past year they all
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
want the opportunity to bring
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
workers back in they all want the
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reinvest in capital
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
reinvest in equipment whatever it might
 
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
reinvest in equipment whatever it might
be

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
and really every dollar helps so what we
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
tried to do is not just create tax
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
relief for businesses but for everyone
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
um and and i really wanted to make sure
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
that we were covering the entire
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
spectrum there
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't create any new taxes
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's another one it's not just that
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
we've cut
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
taxes sometimes you've seen people cut
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
taxes over here but they raise taxes
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
this does none of that no new taxes or
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
fees no increases
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
in taxes or fees um and it doesn't play
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
any sort of political games there's
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
nothing buried in here there's nothing
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
hidden in here
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is write it very
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
simply very upfront um
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
and transparent if anything we've we've
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
tried to be very transparent about
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
everything we do
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
over the last year um so first with the
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax a lot of folks have
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
been talking about this
 
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh my budget reduces the meals and rooms
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
tax from nine percent down to eight and
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
a half percent
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and that just helps folks either take
 
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
um and that just helps folks either take
a

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
people want to go out to get a meal it
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit off that bill it
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of the burden off the
 
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.110 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of the burden off the
business

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
um it allows everybody to to benefit in
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
that and hopefully
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
we can you know continue some of those
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
reductions in in future budgets and
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
future years
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
it obviously helps small businesses by
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
reducing the business enterprise tax
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
from 0.6
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
down to 0.55 percent and then the big
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
one that on the business enterprise tax
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
is really increasing that filing
 
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.790 align:start position:0%
is really increasing that filing
threshold

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
moving the filing threshold up to 250
 
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.550 align:start position:0%
moving the filing threshold up to 250
000

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
will effectively take tens of thousands
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
of businesses maybe even up to 30
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
35 000 businesses won't even have to
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
file that tax anymore
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a savings for the state
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's a savings for that business
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh the net of the net impact of that is
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
a as a few million dollars so we can
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
manage around that
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
but just the ability to take so many of
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
those small businesses entrepreneur
 
00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
those small businesses entrepreneur
businesses

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
that are already laced with too much
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
regulate regulation and paperwork
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
getting them off of that and and really
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do what they should be
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
doing is focusing on their business
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
instead of worrying about paying
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
the state taxes um i think that that's a
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
huge opportunity for small businesses in
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
and then i think the big one is is a tax
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
talked about we've been talking about
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
getting rid of it for literally 50 years
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that's the interest and dividends
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
tax um it we we take it in i think in
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
2023 we go from five down to four
 
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.309 align:start position:0%
2023 we go from five down to four
percent

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then the idea is that we can
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
gradually reduce that phase that to zero
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
and really give seniors retirees they're
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
the ones that just benefit that is just
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
cash in their pockets to reinvest
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
whether it's in their families or their
 
00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:08.469 align:start position:0%
whether it's in their families or their
communities

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
or give them a little more flexibility
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
to stay in this state
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want people to be
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
running down to florida we don't want
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
people to be
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
running down and retiring in other
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
states we want them retiring and
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
creating opportunity here people are
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
living longer they're retiring for a
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
longer amount of time
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
and so the more opportunity we create
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
for those seniors and retirees to keep
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
that money in their pockets
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
we become a magnet not just for small
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
businesses and young families
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
which we're already doing a phenomenal
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
job with but we're also providing that
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity on the other end of the
 
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.029 align:start position:0%
opportunity on the other end of the
spectrum

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
that again those are dollars that are
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to be reinvested right back into
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
our economy
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
education funding always a hot topic you
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
know we're projected to end this
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
biennium with a positive balance
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
of more than 50 million dollars in the
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the strength of that really means
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
that you know if more students were
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
to return back to public schools we know
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
that a lot of students left public
 
00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
that a lot of students left public
schools

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
they took other options as schools were
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
closing or finding their own models
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're assuming a good amount of those
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
students come back but even if more come
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
back into the model
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
we have a cushion there we have
 
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.070 align:start position:0%
we have a cushion there we have
flexibility

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the state can meet its
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
financial obligation
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
for students coming back in
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
it spends more money for students in the
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
biennium than ever
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
before it's a very important one if you
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
look at the dollars we're spending per
 
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.070 align:start position:0%
look at the dollars we're spending per
student

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh we broke the record in the last
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
budget uh that i proposed and we're
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
breaking the record yet again in this
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
budget so more dollars per student
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
than ever before and then for those i
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of municipalities and
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of representatives have
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
probably heard from their their
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
superintendents about this free and
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
issue and and basically we clean that up
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
is what we do
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know because folks didn't have to go
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
through the traditional paperwork and
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
and regulatory barriers to get their
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch we really made it
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
through the federal government we made
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
it very available to everyone that was
 
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
it very available to everyone that was
great

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
um but because of that there's less
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
people actually technically applying for
 
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
people actually technically applying for
free

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch so we know the
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
need is there but it's hard to figure
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
out who's applying and what that does is
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
that really messes with
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
really the the formula that we use to
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
grant adequacy back to cities and towns
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
this budget cleans all that up really we
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
move on to kind of a better system
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that um if that issue were to persist
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
we we don't have
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
a short change we're not shortchanging
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in terms of what we'd
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
be giving them and that's
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
i know that's been a very big issue for
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
manchester and especially a lot of the
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
larger cities that have a lot of
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
students on free and reduced lunch
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the whole point of this budget is we
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
clean that up we fix our formula and we
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
again we're meeting that obligation for
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
our students we're meeting that adequacy
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
as it comes to education funding um
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
so when you add that up or i should say
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
even over and above that we're also
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
allowing for up to 15 million in
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
additional revenue sharing now
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
so we have um through municipalities
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
over the biennium so when you add all
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
the revenue sharing opportunities up
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh it totals as much as 78 million
 
00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh it totals as much as 78 million
dollars

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
by fiscal year 2023 and revenue sharing
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
so it's 78 million
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
back to cities and towns uh over and
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
above the operations of the state which
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
again is is all just about
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh allowing them to uh kind of off
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
off shift a little bit
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
what the locally local property
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would have would have
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
traditionally been paying
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
we can pick up some of that cost um for
 
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
we can pick up some of that cost um for
them

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
you know another thing i didn't get a
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
chance that we didn't we didn't talk
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
about in the presentation that we did
 
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.230 align:start position:0%
about in the presentation that we did
but

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
an important thing that my budget is
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
also looking to do is create some
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
changes with the unemployment trust fund
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
um you know when when we hit 17
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment very very quickly uh the
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal government stepped up and they
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
helped us with a lot of the unemployment
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity but
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
our own fund took its own hit i think
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
most states in the country
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh have are actually in the process of
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
borrowing money from the federal
 
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.350 align:start position:0%
borrowing money from the federal
government

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
just to keep their unemployment trust
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
fund solvent we never had to do that we
 
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
fund solvent we never had to do that we
managed

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
managed
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
very very well and commissioner cabadis
 
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.949 align:start position:0%
very very well and commissioner cabadis
and

00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner laborers deserve a
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
lot of the credit for that they did a
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
with our unemployment trust fund the
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
level of abuse and waste and fraud was
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
really really minimal here it might be
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
even one of the lowest in the country
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're not sure but we think we're the
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
best in the country
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
where other states were literally
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
wasting hundreds of millions of dollars
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
we became very efficient with it now
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
that created
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity of us not having to
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
borrow from the federal government
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
we invested cares act money one of the
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
few states that invested
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of care zach money
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
about 50 million i put in
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
to the unemployment trust fund as well
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
and so what my budget is really
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
proposing to do the changes to the trust
 
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.110 align:start position:0%
proposing to do the changes to the trust
fund

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
is to strategically build the trust
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
during strong economic times
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
to reduce that financial burden on
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
businesses during the downturns
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
so what it what it really does is as our
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
trust fund drops
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
we typically hit businesses with
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
addition an additional tax and
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
and an additional surcharge and what we
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
do is we move those threshold levels and
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
we get rid of the surcharge
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
think about it as the trust fund drops
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's happening in tough economic times
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
and we're actually increasing taxes on
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
businesses while they're struggling the
 
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.790 align:start position:0%
businesses while they're struggling the
most

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really make much sense so
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to really
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
change that model and just by moving
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
some of the thresholds and being able
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
that allows us to remove those
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
surcharges and still maintain
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
a very healthy trust fund and i know uh
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
both matt
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
melo and um and deputy commissioner
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
lavers will talk a lot more about that
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
in detail but it's a real opportunity to
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
kind of modernize
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know this crisis allowed us to
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
really look at our system in depth
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
see how it works in in levels of very
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
high stress
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i think come back with some very
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
proactive ideas uh about just how to
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
make it more viable for the future
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
um strengthening the rainy day fund i i
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
just i'm a huge believer in saving
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
i really am and and you know i don't
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
want to say that we just got lucky we
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
really managed very very well
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of states who just had
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
to drain every bit of their rainy day
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
fund down
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
during this economic crisis luckily we
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
didn't have to do that but we
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
effectively have a cap
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
on our rainy day fund i just
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally disagree with
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
putting a cap on any sort of savings
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
account so this budget also proposes
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
moving that threshold
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
to to hit a 10 percent of the revenue
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
raised over the biennium it effectively
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
doubles the amount we could put in the
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
to ballpark 300 million dollars um when
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
it rains it pours and and again we hope
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
we never have to have another pandemic
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
but without a doubt um you know capping
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
is from a long-term strategy strategic
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
can be a very risky thing and
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
potentially risk higher taxes and
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
increase fees and surcharges and all of
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
this in the future
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
um if we're having to create new taxes
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
just to fill in budgetary holes
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
that could have been done by just uh you
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
know saving a little better
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the short term i talk a lot about
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
student debt assistance
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
um you know when we talk about re you
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
know rebuilding our economy we know
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
businesses they're already coming here
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
which is great
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
they want to expand here but the
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
limitation that businesses have is is
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
twofold number one
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
workforce number two housing and those
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
are very directly connected now i have a
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
a housing bill that i've we put a
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
bipartisan housing bill
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh forward a lot of folks and
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats in the house
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
and the senate
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
are charging forward with that i think
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's a great bill and it really creates
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
incentives not penalties
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
but incentives for local communities to
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
make those investments
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh in in housing uh if you don't have
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
the housing you can't
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
you if the people if the workers that
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
you need for a business to go from a
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
thousand employees to 1300 employees
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
if they literally have no place to live
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
the workers can't come
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
and so if you want to be pro-business if
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
you want to support local businesses
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
big and small you have to find a way to
 
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.430 align:start position:0%
big and small you have to find a way to
create

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
housing in new hampshire and we're not
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
coming in with a a hammer
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
saying you know we're going to take over
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
the housing programming process and all
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
the localities absolutely not local
 
00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.189 align:start position:0%
the localities absolutely not local
control

00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
must be respected it really what
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
separates us but at the same time
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
that does come with the responsibility
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
of moving forward on a local level
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the housing opportunities
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
the other piece there is student debt
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
assistance we know we're one of the
 
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.509 align:start position:0%
assistance we know we're one of the
highest

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
highest
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to states in the country
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
with students with some of the highest
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
debt load
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's right here in new hampshire now we
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
create a lot of economic opportunity
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're one of the wealthiest states in
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
the country we have some of the highest
 
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.670 align:start position:0%
the country we have some of the highest
wages

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
wages
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
but our students still have a lot of
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
debt load so i'm reproposing what i
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
proposed in the last budget which is
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
using the fees that are collected off
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
our 529 plan not taxes but the fees
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
as folks all across the country buy our
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
529 plan
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
um and we have one of the best 529 plans
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh programs in the country which is why
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
why we really collect
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
more fees than we've ever imagined
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
instead of just dumping that into these
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
college endowments that just sit there
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to take those dollars and
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
reinvest them into
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
student debt assistance and if you stay
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
and work
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we'll help pay
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
down your student debt it helps retain
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
workforce it helps lower the student
 
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
workforce it helps lower the student
debt

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
debt
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's not just this free college nonsense
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's being discussed down in
 
00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
that's being discussed down in
washington

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
washington
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
um where again it absolves people of the
 
00:16:58.639 --> 00:16:59.670 align:start position:0%
um where again it absolves people of the
responsibility

00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
where essentially if you think of it
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
buying those workers we're incentivizing
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
those workers
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
to stay and work and hopefully raise
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
their families right here in new
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that encourages more
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
businesses to come
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
they can take advantage of that
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity and help set us apart from
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
everyone else in the northeast so it's
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
those types of things
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
that can set us apart and set us on a
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
very very positive economic path
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of economic growth encouraging
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
businesses to come in and most
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
importantly encouraging that next
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
generation of workforce
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
to live work and play right here in new
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire we talk a lot about paid leave
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
voluntary paid leave it has to happen
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why paid leave should
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
not be happening here in new hampshire
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
and the voluntary plan we put forward is
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's been backed by literally a dozen
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
different businesses uh have looked at
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
this model across the country
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
said they want to be part of it and make
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure that the state doesn't become the
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
as the old plan does it allows real
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
take on the financial risk to be the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
actuarials and simply by
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
providing paid leave for all of the
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
10 000 of them the premiums drop to rock
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
bottom levels
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
and you allow all the other businesses
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
across the state to participate in that
 
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.270 align:start position:0%
across the state to participate in that
program

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
with very low premiums if they choose
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
and employees
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
if they choose it's just up to them by
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
it really is founded in this idea that
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to create
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
very low premiums at the state level by
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
employ by providing the program for all
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
of our state employees
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
and then everybody gets to benefit from
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
that everyone gets to enjoy those low
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
premium benefits
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
on a voluntary basis you don't have to
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
mandate it you don't have to force
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
anybody in
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
it stays economically viable that's been
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
proven and tried and true through all
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
the actuarials
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the real opportunity that i
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us have in when we talk
 
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:41.990 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us have in when we talk
about

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
the gold standard doing paid leave the
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
right way
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement accountability this
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
is another issue that i know a lot of
 
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
is another issue that i know a lot of
you

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
will be taking up um the the leak
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
commission came out with
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh i think 48 different recommendations
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
many of which were able to do through
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
executive order some are
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
passing through and being discussed in
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
in the legislative bodies now
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
um and they all pass unanimously which
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
is tremendous but there are some
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
programs there that also need a little
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
bit of funding whether it's
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know making sure the police
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
standards and training have what they
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
have and i got to tell you i
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
if you have the chance to spend some
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
time with john skipper who is now the
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
new director at police standards and
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
training he's phenomenal
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh he's he's the right thinker the right
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
way the right approach
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
great customer mentality great
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
connection with all local law
 
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.750 align:start position:0%
connection with all local law
enforcement

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
and you know he's really driving the
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
boat on a lot of this and he's just done
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
a phenomenal job
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
so we make sure that we're funding those
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
programs and those opportunities it
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
cameras for our state police it could be
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
the million dollar matching dollars that
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
we've put in
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
for your local governments if your local
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
police want to do cameras or dashboard
 
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:43.990 align:start position:0%
police want to do cameras or dashboard
cams

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
cams
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
we'll help provide matching grants for
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that which i think is a tremendous
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to making sure
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
we're not just saying we're going to be
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
accountable in concord but really making
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
sure this is a community effort
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
up and down new hampshire from from
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
canada to massachusetts from maine to
 
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.470 align:start position:0%
canada to massachusetts from maine to
vermont

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
here in the 603 every community needs to
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
be part of that solution
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we're going to agree on
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
every last detail of course there's a
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
lot of hashing out the legislature is
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to work on
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
but the i think the vast majority of
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
where we know this needs to go we're all
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the same boat on this
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
and providing some of the funds to make
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
that a reality not just talk about it
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
but really make it a reality
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh is really a priority of the
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
administration and is is built into the
 
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
administration and is is built into the
budget

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
in a balanced way um a few more things i
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
know i'm going kind of fast i want to
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
get to questions so
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
just bear with me um the community
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
college and the university system merger
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
everyone's been talking about that a bit
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
um it's i don't want to say it's very
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
simple it's actually very very complex
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
but the process we're going to start is
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
very simple and that's bringing the
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
boards together so bringing a few
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
members of the university board a few
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
members of the community college board
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
and simply saying that if we're going to
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
have everyone just live in their same
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
old silos going about at the same old
 
00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
old silos going about at the same old
way

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get left behind there's
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
that's not a debate that is an absolute
 
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:54.310 align:start position:0%
that's not a debate that is an absolute
fact

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not being left behind ten years
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
from now it's being left behind like two
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
and three years from now
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is a non-partisan bipartisan effort
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no politics involved
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
here which is
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
very good that kind of removes that bad
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
variable from the equation if you will
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
and simply says how do we make it a
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
streamlined process for our students
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
for our faculty how do we challenge
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
ourselves to
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh look at how how do we challenge
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves to look at how
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
we ask students to pay right maybe the
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
different payment plans that we can
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
we can create this different
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities different opportunities
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
for research and development
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
projects for students that otherwise
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
would have never been able to to be
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
exposed to that
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
different opportunities for the
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
four-year college student to actually
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
have more hands-on learning
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
that is provided in the community
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
college which is more necessary than
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
ever now for a viable workforce so
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and really raising up i mean let's
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
face it the community college
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
system is phenomenal in new hampshire it
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
is phenomenal
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
but it's it sometimes is treated as a
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
second tier system
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not those students those
 
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:55.909 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not those students those
faculty

00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
faculty
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
they are just as viable if not more so
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
with some of their skills
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
than a lot of the opportunities we're
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
creating just in the university system
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
and so now bringing everyone together
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
on an even par not one over-the-air
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
other but a true partnership
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
and allowing them to help figure out
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
some of these details i think is the
 
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.230 align:start position:0%
some of these details i think is the
opportunity

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
we just i don't think it's a question we
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
we have to we have to allow that to
 
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.789 align:start position:0%
we have to we have to allow that to
happen

00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
and not it'll save us some money it
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
might cost us a little money in the
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
short term maybe it saves us some money
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the long term
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't just about a budgetary move
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
by any means this is about a modern 21st
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
century education system
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is streamlined that's seamless do
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know our system
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
has hundreds of agreements within it
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
these credits in this class can transfer
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
to these credits with this university
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and these credits in this university
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
transfer to these credits over here
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's literally hundreds of agreements
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
that are floating around there on the
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
back end it's so convoluted
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
why not have a single system a single
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
process make it seamless
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
on the back end seamless on the front
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
end raise everybody
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
to a level where they are picking their
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
path in higher education
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
and we're not just you know trying to
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
cram them into the the old-fashioned
 
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.630 align:start position:0%
cram them into the the old-fashioned
silos

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
silos
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
so a lot of a lot of opportunity there i
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
talked about the department of energy
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to bring that up because i
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
know a lot of folks in the house have
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
been asking about it
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
right now we have our public utility
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
commission there are essentially our
 
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.029 align:start position:0%
commission there are essentially our
judges

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
that will debate and adjudicate on
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
rates and things of that nature but at
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
the same time manage a department
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's also managing policy it's a
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
massive conflict of interest and again
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
no politics involved here folks on both
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle i think are thrilled
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we're finally separating those two
 
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.390 align:start position:0%
that we're finally separating those two
parts

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know they'll be connected
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
administratively but let the judges do
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
the judging
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
and let the department do the
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
departmenting if you will and uh and by
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
separating those two i think you're just
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to create
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunity because
 
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
the conflict of interest start really
 
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
the conflict of interest start really
disappearing

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
disappearing
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so that's really what that's about
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's just taking a a system that has
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
grown big and it's very important system
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
but mixing having judges be managers of
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
a department
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
managing policy that they have to then
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
adjudicate on
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make any sense and and you
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
get a lot of recusals and all this sort
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
of thing so
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's more of a simple simplification
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
of the process and i think it's been
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
received very very well so far
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
um let's talk a little bit about health
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
and human services so
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
a couple things we modernize a lot of
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
the it infrastructure in health and
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
in this budget which i think is is a
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
huge opportunity
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's long-term structural investments
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
there we keep our commitments we
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
increase funding for the dd community
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
we keep our commitments to dcyf that has
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
been doing a phenomenal job i showed on
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
the chart
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh in my brother budget presentation
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
that where
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
the number of cases of cases per worker
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
when i first became governor was 80 90
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
close to 90 per worker and we've gotten
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
that down to about a dozen very
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
manageable level
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
and we still have vacancies which is
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
great so we can still fill those
 
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
great so we can still fill those
vacancies

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
but we create efficiencies within those
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
those systems and just get
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
the product out which is better better
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
services for those kids
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
better attention one-on-one attention
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
for those kids and those families
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's what's going to get better
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
results and whether it's talking about
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
saving money in the long run or just
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
getting these kids on a better path it's
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
all win
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
and so those investments have already
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
started paying off huge dividends
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we talked about the medicaid
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
rate increases a very contentious part
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the last budget
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
we said would raise the rates 3.1
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
percent and then 3.1 percent
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going back on that commitment
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks said we should i won't do
 
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.390 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks said we should i won't do
it

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
i think we have to maintain that
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
commitment i'm a big believer in
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
promises made our promises kept
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and so keeping that 3.1 percent increase
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
for the full biennium
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
and moving forward is very important
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
this budget also does things just uh a
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
couple of last minute things and then
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll be quiet for questions but
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh we kind of modernized the adult
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
parole board uh we've had some issues
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
with the adult parole board in
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
a variety of fashion and so what we do
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
is we kind of just rebuild it
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
re-modernize it
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
reorganize it if you will we digitize
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
the board's day-to-day operations we
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
definitely save a lot of money and
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency in doing that
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
um you know what i'm a big believer also
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
in unifor unifying are dispatching
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
functions so
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know fish and game has a dispatching
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
center over there for a while marine
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
patrol had a dispatching center over
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
there safety had a dispatching center
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
we brought marine patrol in to to safety
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and it's worked very
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
one of the outliers right now is fish
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
and game so we're going to bring them
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
back in
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
as well and make sure it's a unified
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
system because at the end of the day
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to health and safety in
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
this state at least
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's all hands on deck it's not about
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
silos local works very
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
very well with state and federal
 
00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.470 align:start position:0%
very well with state and federal
partners

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
they work from town to town and county
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
to county
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're very we do it really really
 
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.549 align:start position:0%
we're we're very we do it really really
well

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of the seamless communication
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
of safety but we still have this
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
this for whatever reason fish and game
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
was never dispatchers never included i
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
think we just need to
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
include it and now something else you'll
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
see not so much in this budget but we're
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
already moving forward with
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
is called mutual link which links up
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals to our dispatching centers
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
schools to our dish dispatching centers
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
so it really is a seamless communication
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
protocol up and down
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
and again we just want to make sure
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
everybody is part of those opportunities
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
so again you know i'll i'll kind of back
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
up and leave it there
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
you guys know the budget a lot better
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
i i just want to reiterate this budget
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
is balanced within itself i've just
 
00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.430 align:start position:0%
is balanced within itself i've just
heard

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
some of this talk that we are counting
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
on additional federal assistance
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
zero not a penny of additional federal
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
assistance is needed
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
to balance this budget uh that would be
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
a very irresponsible thing to do
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
right we may get other federal
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
assistance and that'll be great and
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with that when it comes it'll
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
likely be one-time money for one-time
 
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
likely be one-time money for one-time
projects

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
you would never want to use that in
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
operational costs anyways and we
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
count on none of that not for our
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
capital budgets uh none of it now if it
 
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:48.789 align:start position:0%
capital budgets uh none of it now if it
comes

00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
comes
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature will have a big hand in
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
terms of how those dollars are spent and
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
making sure that we can spend it very
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
but that has nothing to do with this
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
budget i just want to be very very clear
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and i think whatever whatever changes
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
are made and however the legislature
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
decides to go
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a big believer that the opportunity
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
to spend any of our extra money
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
any of the savings we're able to achieve
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
through this process sending it back to
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
cities and towns off shooting offsetting
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
some of those costs that they bear
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's such an important part of this um
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
increasing that room
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
that you know moving the rooms and meals
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
threshold not just lowering the tax
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
but by moving the threshold and getting
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
closer to the commitment that we made
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns years ago
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
putting another 15 million dollars in
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
that rooms and meals commitment
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
is an absolute huge step um every year
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
we pass a budget that suspends that
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
right we got to move beyond that and so
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
we kind of move that we don't quite get
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
there this year
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
but over time i think we can but we get
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
closer to that and again it's all just
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
cash that goes back to those cities and
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
towns that they've never that they've
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
never been able to have before while at
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
the same time having a room in meals tax
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
cut i mean think about it we're cutting
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
the room and meals tax
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
and sending 15 million more back to
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
cities that's a huge win
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
a huge win and we still have a balanced
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
budget so i think there's a lot of
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity there and i know you know
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
you folks have
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
have dealt with this a lot more than i
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
have you've looked at these numbers in
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
many ways a lot more than i have and
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
because your constituents will be
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
very active i'm sure in pushing
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
different different things but
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
um i just think that there's great
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity here we're in great economic
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
times and and you know as we come out of
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
this much better than we ever thought i
 
00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:20.470 align:start position:0%
this much better than we ever thought i
think

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
that this summer is going to be
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely phenomenal with travel
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
tourism room and meals all of it is
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to really be booming
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so you know we don't want a budget
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
process to hold us up there we want the
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
budget process to create opportunity
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
there so we can maximize it
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of the state and with
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
that i'll uh i'll be quiet and we can
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
take some questions whether lisa and
 
00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:40.070 align:start position:0%
take some questions whether lisa and
matt

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
matt
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
and the whole team are here for you
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
whatever you need and and again please
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
understand we'll answer everything we
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
can here
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
but if there's certain details we can't
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
answer we'll we'll just
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
we'll put a package together with all
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
the questions and be sure to send
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
something uh over to the committee as
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
soon as we can with
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
any of the details that you're looking
 
00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:58.230 align:start position:0%
any of the details that you're looking
for

00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much governor so you want
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
us to hold the
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
questions for matt no
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
all right no i mean that's here i'm matt
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%

i am i'm here mr chairman and happy to
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
all right i see uh questions on the
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
screen from the people
 
00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
at home and i'll start with the
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
representative heath for a question for
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
governor for taking my question
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
my question is relative you know me in
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
education and my love of the university
 
00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
education and my love of the university
system

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
the unique system and and i see that you
 
00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:39.669 align:start position:0%
the unique system and and i see that you
have

00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
taken away the endowment fund portion
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
that goes um to the schools right now
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
this is one of the most difficult times
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
for our colleges and universities do you
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
really think this is a good time to take
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
that away
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh what have they ever used that
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
endowment fund for
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
well right for things like right now um
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
they've they
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're right they have put it aside and
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
and they've saved it
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
for things that they need um but right
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
now is is one of those times i think
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
under extreme duress um and it just
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
they are very concerned about it yeah so
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
the endowment funds are all limited they
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
cannot be used for operational costs
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
they all have those restrictions so
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're providing a lot of capital
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
for example we put two things
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
let's go to the university system in
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
particular they asked for a lot of money
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the state over three bienniums to do
 
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
for the state over three bienniums to do
their

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
bio life sciences building i committed
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
to that i did it we did this portion
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
last year we're doing a portion this
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
year we're not backing out of that
 
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
year we're not backing out of that
commitment

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
i've put money in the last time to
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
double the number of nurses
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
out of unh which i had to fight to get
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
back in i know folks wanted to take that
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
out i fought to get it back in
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
so we're making those capital
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
investments for them
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
the capital in terms of the university
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
system is is fairly healthy right now
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is that we're
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
investing the money into students
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
we need workers students need to be
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
living off that and that
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
that endowment that extra money that
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
goes into the endowment is more than we
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
ever anticipated if we weren't meeting
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
certain commitments with the endowment i
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
get it but this is money over and above
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
what was ever projected to go into the
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
system in the first place and it's
 
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.669 align:start position:0%
system in the first place and it's
tax-free

00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
tax-free
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
so i just think it's an opportunity at
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
some point it's not about the system it
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
has to be about the students and the
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
workforce coming in and so
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i know they're under a lot of
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
pressure to be sure but i think that's
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
one of the opportunities in bringing the
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
two systems together at the same time
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
right allowing the community college and
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
the entire university system
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
create those synergies effectively
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
expanding their
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
their their physical space their
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
all that will come into play in terms of
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
how the you know where the endowment
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
goes but i
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of with you i was always
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
shocked with the restrictions
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
that the endowment is self-imposed upon
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
itself it can't be used
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
for their everyday costs unfortunately
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you governor next question comes
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.630 align:start position:0%
from representative
walner

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you governor and
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
chairman wheeler i i have a couple of
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
the first one is going to be is sort of
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
a maybe a
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
simple question that may be the hardest
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
question to answer and
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is we're still waiting on house
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
bill 2. and i'm wondering
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh when we might see that and
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's very hard for the finance committee
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
to proceed
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
with their work on the budget until we
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
have house bill 2 available so i'm just
 
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:36.789 align:start position:0%
have house bill 2 available so i'm just
wondering

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
what you think that when you think that
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
might be available sure
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
matt do you want to answer that
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely this is matthew melo
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
question uh hb
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
2 was delivered to the lba
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
on the 15th as statutorily required
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh so they are working through the
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
logistics there
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
and it's our expectation that you'll see
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
it relatively soon but at this point
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
it has been delivered
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean i think you understand
 
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:09.430 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean i think you understand
because

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
you've put this together so i think you
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
understand how important hb2
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
is to the work of the house as we
 
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.869 align:start position:0%
is to the work of the house as we
proceed

00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
um so governor i thought it was i think
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
it's interesting when you talk about
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
um the 300 million dollar
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
cap on the rainy day fund
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
and i think everyone would agree that um
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
a goal like that is a is an admirable
 
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.629 align:start position:0%
a goal like that is a is an admirable
goal

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
but then when i look on page nine of the
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
executive budget summary which is
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
basically what i've got to work from
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
um i see by the end of
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
2023 we'll be at about
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
85 million lower than we were
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of 2020 and i wonder what
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of projections you have around the
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and where we're going with it sure
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
um i don't i don't really have any
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
projections beyond this biennium i think
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know conceptually we've we had to
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
dig into it a little to make up that
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
that 50 million dollar hole
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
we balance the budget here um i think
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
what we want to look at
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
is you know how do we grow it in the
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
future and even if it's 10 million here
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
and 20 million there and 30 million
 
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
and 20 million there and 30 million
there

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's just like putting money away for
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
your christmas account or whatever or
 
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.069 align:start position:0%
your christmas account or whatever or
whatever

00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
it might be so again you know we're able
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
to kind of stabilize
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
our losses this i think very well this
 
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
our losses this i think very well this
time

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
but you know where we go with that i
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
think that i'll leave that completely up
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
but you know my first two budgets we
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
always had the discussion if we wanted
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
to increase the rainy day account well
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
we have a limit well we have a limit
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
i just don't think we should have a
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
limit if we have really good economic
 
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
limit if we have really good economic
times

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
let's put it in savings doesn't mean you
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
can spend on infrastructure and capital
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
projects too of course
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
but there should always be the ability
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
to put something in savings without
 
00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
to put something in savings without
saying

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know we have a cap so we don't make
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
any additional projections beyond that i
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't think matt do we i don't think
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
because i don't think it'd be
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate i think we're just trying to
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
get the economy back on track
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know given all the extra money we
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
had in the first two budgets after the
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
first two bienniums that we we went
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
through here
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's an awesome opportunity and it's
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
always great to we've i think been very
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
smart about reinvesting that one-time
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
money into one-time projects
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
but partially because you know there was
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
always a limit on what we could save and
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
i it's just about creating a flexibility
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the legislature i mean if you don't
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
want to do it you don't have to do it
 
00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
want to do it you don't have to do it
but

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
it just gives like the future
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
legislatures a lot more flexibility to
 
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.990 align:start position:0%
legislatures a lot more flexibility to
save

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
save
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you i do have one more if i
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
could if you don't mind i
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
if you've got an extra minute so my last
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
question is i i know you've talked a lot
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
about your um
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
tax reductions and it's a variety of
 
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.430 align:start position:0%
tax reductions and it's a variety of
different

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
different reductions but i wonder if you
 
00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:54.710 align:start position:0%
different reductions but i wonder if you
had

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
a total value of what those
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
are worth in this budget how much
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
total dollars does this represent
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
a great great question i'm going to look
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
to matt a little bit i know we discussed
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
that a couple weeks ago
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely and this will be hashed out
 
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
absolutely and this will be hashed out
more

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
with ways and means tomorrow morning but
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
changes over the biennium amount to
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
between 50 and 55 million dollars
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things in there of
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
course with the various tax proposals
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
that are included in this budget
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
um and we'll be happy to go into detail
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
with the committee tomorrow morning
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
as they put together their revenue
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
estimates based on current law and also
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
um what hb2 effectively uh will put in
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
place if it were to become law
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you governor
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you mary jane
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
oh um thank you uh mr chair and thank
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
you governor for
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
the presentation and taking questions um
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative wallner addressed most
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
of mine but and again
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
without house bill 2 it's kind of hard
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
to wrap
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
my head around what's occurring but i'm
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
just interested in
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the anticipated increase in tax
 
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.190 align:start position:0%
in the anticipated increase in tax
revenues

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
aligned with the deductions in tax
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
revenues and just
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
as an example of course in rooms and
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
meals we're going to see a spike as
 
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
meals we're going to see a spike as
compared

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
compared
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
to last year but going back further than
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
um i really don't see how those two
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
correlate and is there something in the
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 that
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
will help me make sense out of this
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
because um i agree i'm happy to seek tax
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
deductions but
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
um i guess i look at it macro as well as
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
microly and blooms and meals for example
 
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:49.589 align:start position:0%
microly and blooms and meals for example
these

00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
these are comments from local businesses
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
who have a great concern
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
about their property taxes which is a
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
real problem up here
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
for many of us berlin has a highest rate
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
in the state um
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
how can we increase
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
revenue sharing in rooms and meals um
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
with this deduction and individually the
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
comment was simply this
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody buys a breakfast for ten
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
dollars in one of my businesses
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
that gives them a nickel bag that half a
 
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.710 align:start position:0%
that gives them a nickel bag that half a
percent

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
but in reality it has a big impact on
 
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.310 align:start position:0%
but in reality it has a big impact on
what's

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
collected in a hole so how are these
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
going to match up and how's that going
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
to happen i don't know if that's a fair
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
question at this point
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
but i i'm i'm just really having a hard
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
time getting my head around these two
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
um dynamics that are in place sure and
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm happy to address it
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
no look i'm the governor everything's a
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
fair question you give me whatever you
 
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
fair question you give me whatever you
got

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
um so you're absolutely correct the room
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
and meals tax is going to be one of the
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
toughest ones to come back over the long
 
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.430 align:start position:0%
toughest ones to come back over the long
term

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
and we're we're i'm still projecting
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
overall revenue is still going to be
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
lower than we've seen in previous years
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a little while for
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
that to come back i think we have a
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
great summer
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying we're going to
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily be breaking rooms and meals
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
records but where we do
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
make up for a lot of that on the state
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
side is the business profits tax the
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax the
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
lottery liquor all of these
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
programs are doing really i mean
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
record-breaking numbers this year
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so we're not assuming that they're
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
going exponential by any means but even
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
if they just go up a couple
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
percent or so from where we are this
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
year that creates a lot of the
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity that offsets i know a lot of
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
the concerns that folks have
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
specifically around room and meal so
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think what we've tried to do is say
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
look room and meals can affect a lot of
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
local cities and towns in terms of the
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity we give them
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
you're right reducing the tax a half a
 
00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
you're right reducing the tax a half a
percent

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
can be somewhat minimal but i get i'll
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
tell you what it's a heck of a lot
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
better than going a half percent in the
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
other direction and over years we always
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
justified well it's just a quarter
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
percent here and a half a percent there
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
and next thing you know we have one of
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
the highest rooms of meals taxes around
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
and and we need to be competitive with
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
other states consumers do look at this
 
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.270 align:start position:0%
other states consumers do look at this
as

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
someone who used to be in this game of
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
owning restaurants and hotels i can tell
 
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
owning restaurants and hotels i can tell
you

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
people really do look at these these
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities in terms of
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
um it might only be a nickel off of
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
a small bill but when you add hotel
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
rooms and a weekend away and all of that
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff it really does add up and so
 
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
that stuff it really does add up and so
by

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
sending this in the right direction and
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
being able to take advantage of the
 
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.109 align:start position:0%
being able to take advantage of the
strong

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
business profit business enterprise real
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
estate tax all these other taxes that
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
are doing well
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
that can help offset and create the
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the cities and towns
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
remember most of the bet will go into
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
education right and the rest of it most
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
of the bpt goes to kind of the general
 
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.670 align:start position:0%
of the bpt goes to kind of the general
fund

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
but so those funds typically don't go
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
back to cities and towns room and meals
 
00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:46.069 align:start position:0%
back to cities and towns room and meals
does

00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
so let's create the opportunity there
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
and get that you know flexibility back
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
to the cities in town so it's it's an
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
offset you're absolutely right i don't
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
think those numbers are going to keep
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
going up
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to because they're
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
offset by the strength of the other
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you governor representative ober
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
for a question here in the chamber
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
is that okay thank you mr chairman
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
governor thank you for
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
meeting with us and having your staff
 
00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
meeting with us and having your staff
available

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know and i know we dig into this to
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
find detail
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
so really what i want to ask is if i
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
send mr kane
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
several questions and ask him to send
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
them over to your budget director will
 
00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
them over to your budget director will
you

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
have him dig into them for example one
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
of the questions i'm interested in
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
is your new department of energy several
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
years ago i was part of the group that
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
wrote the site evaluation
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
rsa and in hindsight there are these
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
i wish we hadn't done and you've now
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
moved the puc which controls that
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
into a new agency so i'm kind of curious
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
in hp2
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you handle some of those things and
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'll give you one example because you
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
did say
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicative commissioners are moved to
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
an administrative agency
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
we made a mistake and had the site
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
actually do some of the follow-up and
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
it's in the state law unfortunately
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
that probably should have gone to des on
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
the permitting and
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
some of the certifications every now and
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
then we talk about trying to do
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
something well you're doing something
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to work with matt and see if
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
we got rid of some of those niggles and
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
would you mind if we
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
send in some written questions to your
 
00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
send in some written questions to your
staff

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
i would i would love it again look you
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
folks have been on the front lines of
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
this especially you lynn and some others
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
a lot longer than we have and and that's
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
a hugely valuable
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
understanding because you've heard the
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
direct testimony you understand the
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
pushes and pulls and what maybe has been
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
tried and what hasn't so
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
no your questions would be i i'm begging
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
you for the questions because that helps
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
us understand
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know where conceptually maybe we
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
haven't haven't planned it all the way
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
out but there's no doubt that we can
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
make it a better system and so yeah send
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
over whatever you want and we'll we'll
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you that'd be fun
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative lynn
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a question in the chamber
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you uh governor um i
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
i have to say just some follow-up to
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
representative ober's question i i think
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the department of energy makes
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous sense
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
to separate the sort of adjudicatory
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh functions from uh from the management
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
administration of the uh of the
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
department i
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering along the same lines when
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
you talked about the
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
the parole the changes you've proposed
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the parole board
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that and i think
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's i think it
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot of sense i saw that
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
you're proposing to make the chair of
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
the parole board a full-time position
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
which i think
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
makes makes a lot of sense i'm i'm
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
wondering though
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
if my understanding is that the parole
 
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.910 align:start position:0%
if my understanding is that the parole
board

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
right now also has some
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
administrative kind of kinds of
 
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
administrative kind of kinds of
responsibilities

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
um probably probably nowhere near as
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
great as the as the public utilities
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
commission does
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
but still has some and i'm wondering if
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
it would make sense
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
to make a similar kind of change with
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
the parole board that is to let them
 
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
the parole board that is to let them
have

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
let them have their adjudicative
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility as the parole board
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
but perhaps put them you know more fully
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
under the department of corrections
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
administratively or maybe under the
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety but
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
in other words have somebody else do the
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
sort of administrative
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that the parole board
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
does now i think that sounds like a
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
great idea
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think we really thought of
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
it that way but that would make a lot of
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
sense so
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
definitely something we should look into
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
matt what do you think i mean is that
 
00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
matt what do you think i mean is that
possible

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely happy to work with your
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative on what some of those
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
details might look like
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you sounds like that's
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
why we have hp2
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
any other questions i don't see any
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
hands on the screen
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
everybody all set work together on this
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
and i know it'll come out right
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
it always does well thank you guys i
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%

know we've we've the good news is
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
i've actually done this a couple times
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
now i'm getting much better at it
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i really do believe it's one of the
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
best budgets we've ever put forth given
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
tough economic times but huge
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity going forward
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%

and i know whatever whatever turns out
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a great budget in the
 
00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:32.309 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a great budget in the
