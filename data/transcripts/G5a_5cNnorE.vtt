governor sununu
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
on his budget address yesterday
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
and his uh introduction of the idea of
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
creating a department of energy for the
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire back in 2018
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
or 2017 i don't remember exactly
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
which day
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
there was a proposal for a study
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
investigate starting a
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.110 align:start position:0%
department of energy
and

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
i remember saying at the time that
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
that should be the prerogative of the
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
governor just the department of energy
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then in 2019 a study commission was
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
formed to study that issue and
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
it came to no significant conclusions
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
because the rightful place i believe for
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
starting the department of energy is
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
with the executive
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
branch of the government so i
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
congratulate the other governor on his
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
innovative plan to
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
abolish the

department of energy for many years we
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea this state needs
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to consolidate
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%

plans to have an executive session
 
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
plans to have an executive session

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
we are operating opportunistic about
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
executive sessions if we should
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh conclude a public hearing with time
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
left in the hour then we may have one if
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
we did have one we would exec
 
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.670 align:start position:0%

today
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
if we had time
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm not expecting that we will have
 
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
but i'm not expecting that we will have
time

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%

day's activity
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%

bill 172
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
and that is a bill that establishes
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emission reduction goals
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
for the state and establishes a climate
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
action plan its prime sponsor is
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative weston who apparently is
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
not available
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask uh representative
 
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask uh representative
mcgee

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry we're going to ask uh
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
to interest introduce the bill to us
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
now before you start representative
 
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
now before you start representative
oxendine

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
oxendine
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
i have to inform the entire committee
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we have 15 people who've signed up
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill therefore we're
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to strictly limit
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
the time that people are allowed to
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
speak in addition to that we're going to
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
strictly limit the amount of questions
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
that committee members can ask so we're
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
going to have to enforce the rule
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
that if you are a sponsor or a
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on the bill you're not
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask questions
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
so with those ground rules in place we
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
can now ask
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative occident to introduce
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
and don't forget to unmute
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative oxman
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir i have a
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
am now presenting for representative
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
weston who has a five minutes as the
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor then i would have had two
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
minutes as the the next person up could
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
if i combine those and get them into
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
just a little bit over five minutes will
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
that be possible
 
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
that be possible
uh

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
possible but you have to be very careful
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
about making sure you don't exceed
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
your time limit could you give me the
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
30-second warning that you were giving
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh people
 
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.949 align:start position:0%
uh people
recently

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely that that would be very
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
helpful and and i had another another
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
point uh senator sue prentice is
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak to this bill but she's
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
not available between 9 15 and 9 30. so
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
if you could call on her outside of
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
those parameters that would be very
 
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
those parameters that would be very
helpful

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.949 align:start position:0%
helpful
okay

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
let's start the clock
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead hb 172
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
is a bill that calls for planning
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
preparation and protection for this
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire if we turn to
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
the bill itself and look at the findings
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
it lays out the plan very very
 
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
it lays out the plan very very
succinctly

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
succinctly
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence for the warming of
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
the climate system is unequivocal this
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
warming is overwhelmingly attributable
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
to human activity and development
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
particularly the combustion of fossil
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
fuels left unchecked the climate crisis
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
will continue to have real and possibly
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
catastrophic impacts on new hampshire's
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
residents economy and environment
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
it will impinge on the health and safety
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
of all our families
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire will see longer and hotter
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
summers shorter warmer winters more
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
frequent and more extreme precipitation
 
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.190 align:start position:0%
frequent and more extreme precipitation
events

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
events
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
more flooding more drought
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
climate impacts will endanger the health
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire families by
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
facilitating the spread of vector-borne
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
diseases as well as increasing rates of
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
respiratory and cardiovascular disease
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
imposing mortality and morbidity burdens
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
on our citizens
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
increased warming and more extreme and
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
more frequent precipitation events will
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
also negatively impact key sectors of
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's resource-based economy
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
harming agriculture tourism and outdoor
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
recreational activities
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
a warmer and more acidic gulf of maine
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
will see increased coastal flooding

and endanger lives homes and productive
properties

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
taking proactive measures to mitigate
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
the climate crisis also presents
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for new hampshire and with
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
proper planning and possibly a
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy the state should
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
more quickly be able to move to maximize
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
those co-benefits that exist in
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
mitigating the disruption
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
as renewable resources like wind and
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
solar increasingly replace fossil fuels
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing businesses should be po
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
poised to reap the benefits
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
the state should act to ensure new
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
hampshire is well represented in any
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
multi-state efforts to harvest those
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
wind resources in addition to helping
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
our state replacing fossil fuels with
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
zero emission sources of energy will
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
improve the health of our families by
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
reducing pollution that degrades our
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
air quality and also help with our
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
tourism-based economy
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
producing energy from local resources
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
will keep billions of energy dollars in
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
state instead of sending them out of
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
state to fossil fuel producers and
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes out of the country
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
this will create a virtuous in-state
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
development cycle
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
a more renewably based and energy
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient government will save
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money retain more of that
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
money in the state and help grow new
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
it is incumbent upon us to take prompt
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
proactive and continuing action to
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
protect our residents from the
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
anticipated consequences of the climate
 
00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
anticipated consequences of the climate
crisis

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
to mitigate those harms to the extent
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
possible and to safeguard new
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire's resources for generations to
 
00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire's resources for generations to
come

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
in view of the um time constraint i
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
think i will leave my comments there and
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%

hampshire will not be able to be here
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
today so after my questions could we
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%

okay chairman vos members of the
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for letting me come
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
on i'm not sure what the confusion was
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
because i came into the meeting five
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
minutes early but here i am and i want
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to thank representative oxenham for
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
doing a wonderful job
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh of filling in
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
she did mention a lot of the points i
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
was going to make so what i will do
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
is skip to an aspect that i don't think
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
she mentioned and that that is this
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
is not just a climate action plan it's
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
also an economic development plan
 
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
also an economic development plan
um

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
oxenham mentioned a lot of the things
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
about the the dangers of not paying
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
attention to this and the cost of doing
 
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
attention to this and the cost of doing
nothing

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
but i think right now we have to
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that we are in a
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
situation where we have a new
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
administration in washington i read a
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
result of a poll just yesterday that
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
stated climate change is the number two
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
concern of citizens across this country
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and with the change in our leadership we
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
have an administration that's now
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
responding to this concern
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
i predict that there'll be a lot of
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
programs coming out soon from washington
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
that could help us with the transition
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
if but if we don't start this process
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
now we'll not be ready we won't be able
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
to hit the ground running when these
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
these opportunities come through this
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill empowers des to do that so this is
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely the right time to be making
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
this change
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the senate hearing there's a lot of
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about a cost-benefit analysis
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
2009 task force report there was a
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
excellent cost-benefit analysis and
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
these analysis had always are also being
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
done in states around us
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts in vermont
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
and the state of maine has just filed a
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
terrific report that's available online
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
that has a whole chapter about the
 
00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:39.190 align:start position:0%
that has a whole chapter about the
benefits

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
of um of making
 
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.789 align:start position:0%
of um of making
uh

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
of initiating a climate change action
 
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.230 align:start position:0%
of initiating a climate change action
plan

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
as i said i'm a little reflux because of
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
the cha the um mix-up but i do hope that
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
you'll consider that this would be an
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
economic benefit to the state
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
and um i'll be happy to take questions
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:01.669 align:start position:0%
the seacoast
and

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to bring up a couple of
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
points i'm also a practicing physician
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
and i was chair of the ad hoc commission
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
on uh admissions we were known as the
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
emissions commission we met over the six
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
months come and finished our report in
 
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.870 align:start position:0%
months come and finished our report in
december

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
and i bring uh two different slightly
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
different perspectives to this uh
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
discussion the first is
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
as the uh seacoast senator having all
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
the waterfront from newcastle down to
 
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.270 align:start position:0%
the waterfront from newcastle down to
seabrook

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
seabrook
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
as part of my district
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
i would like to underscore the concern
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we have on a regional impact
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
which has to do with sea level rise and
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
storm surges uh these are well
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
documented we just had a meeting last
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
week of
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
actually this week of the hampton beach
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
area commission
 
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
area commission
and

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
that group was talking about how do we
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
respond to sea level rise and as
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
we're aware the sea level rise is a
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
reflection of climate change um and
 
00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
reflection of climate change um and
warming

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
warming
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that's one concern but on a public
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
health standpoint we had a wonderful
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
presentation by dr katie bush from the
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
in our ad hoc commission on the public
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
health component
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
the not only the health side of
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
not only is that critical but the fiscal
 
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.470 align:start position:0%
not only is that critical but the fiscal
side

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
side
uh

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
is also
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
an important consideration here
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
emissions reduction goals
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
have a direct impact on on patient
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
safety and on disease burden for the
 
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.549 align:start position:0%
safety and on disease burden for the
state

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
especially in patients with asthma copd
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
and other pulmonary diseases or lung
 
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
and other pulmonary diseases or lung
diseases

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage you all to think
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
about that as you're crafting
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
your this bill and working on this bill
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
the other is i absolutely applaud the
 
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
the other is i absolutely applaud the
governor's

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
decision to start the department of
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
energy and i would think that there may
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
need to look at the bill and whether
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
there would need to be any amendments
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
that would dovetail this not only with
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
des but also with the department of
 
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
des but also with the department of
energy

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.270 align:start position:0%
energy
and

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
finally i'm offering my full support to
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
work with you all as this comes over to
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we have a
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
coordinated effort to ensure its passage
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
you did it in two minutes and 50 seconds
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
well done sir brevity
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
any questions for senator sherman it
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
looks like representative samsich is
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
um

00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
i wanna could you elaborate a little bit
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
more about the health impacts that that
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
are connected uh as you see to this bill
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
i think we've known for a long time the
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
impact of pollution on health
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
weather but we tend to think of that as
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
something that happens in the cities you
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
know new york boston and other big
 
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
know new york boston and other big
cities

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
cities
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
but in fact in parts of new hampshire
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
particulate pollution is
 
00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
particulate pollution is
critically

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
critically
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
impactful on people's health
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
most of this is on lung disease but we
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
also see it on
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
when you think about how the body works
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you breathe something in
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
that will eventually come back up and
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
well actually i'm a gastroenterologist
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
it will eventually impact your gi tract
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
as those
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
particles are moved through the system
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
so in terms of a cancer impact
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
pollution has impact on lung cancer has
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
all of the elimination
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
roots uh which would include the gi
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
tract and the uh
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
and the kidneys
 
00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:08.149 align:start position:0%
and the kidneys
so

00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
decreasing emissions um
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
would have real-time impact on pediatric
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
diseases like asthma
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
there are studies that have been shown
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
through harvard that actually looked at
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
pregnant women
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
and monitored their air intake by
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
putting basically what's called a nasal
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
cannula by their nose and measuring what
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
they were breathing in also looked at
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
the cord blood
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
to the fetus
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
and those particular matters that
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
pollution was getting not only into the
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
woman's lungs but also passing into the
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
cord blood
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
so we know that these are impacting even
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
fetuses in development
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
reduction of emissions reduction of
 
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.590 align:start position:0%
reduction of emissions reduction of
pollution

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
pollution
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
from public health standpoint is
 
00:25:57.919 --> 00:25:59.430 align:start position:0%
from public health standpoint is
critical

00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to provide the
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
tape of katie bush's uh presentation if
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful for the commission
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for the committee in their
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
deliberations but it was compelling now
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
not just on the public health standpoint
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
but also on the fiscal impact if you
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
think of the burden of
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
lung disease and cancer in the state and
 
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.830 align:start position:0%
lung disease and cancer in the state and
and

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
remind us that we are we have some of
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
the highest rates not only of pediatric
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
cancer in the state i'm sorry in the
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
country new hampshire does but also
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
esophageal cancer breast cancer and
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
other cancers
 
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
other cancers
so

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
we do have a public health
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
imperative uh which and one component of
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
that is air pollution
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh senator sherman follow-up
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions i would uh no other raised
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
hands i would like to
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
call on our next speaker
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative kat mcgee it's all yours
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
for three minutes
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr chair
 
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr chair
um

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
after hearing what's been mentioned
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
today i think i'll just
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
add around what was said i actually was
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
one of two house representatives who sat
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
on the admissions commission with
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
senator sherman senator waters and
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
and in addition to the health effects
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
that were covered in that commission
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
we had a wonderful presentation from
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
chris skoglund over at des
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
and he basically chronicled for us what
 
00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
our plans had been when we had a
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
department of energy and he talked about
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
how that downward trajectory was going
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
to level off if we didn't have
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
additional policies around uh our
 
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.950 align:start position:0%
additional policies around uh our
emissions

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
in 2021 so this would be that year
 
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
and so i signed on to this bill when i
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
saw it i asked to be a co-sponsor
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
because i recognized that there was a a
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
a missing piece in having something to
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
focus on in terms of a plan my
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
background is as a as a project and
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
program manager and so i know that if
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do anything
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh ambitious and you don't have a plan
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
you're you're not going to succeed
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'm also very happy to hear that the
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
governor is planning to put a department
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
of energy back in place
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
but i think we've lost four years and
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
that would be my recommendation for hb
 
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.190 align:start position:0%
that would be my recommendation for hb
172

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
172
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
at least if we have some focus and move
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
forward as a house to say
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we would like to
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
get to work on it rather than have
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
further delays in the setup and the
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
funding et cetera et cetera of having
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
that energy department come into being
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh then i think we would be
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
that much further along
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh the bill asked both parties to come
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
together and acknowledge that the
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
planning is the thing
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
that gets us to the right answers
 
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.909 align:start position:0%
that gets us to the right answers
together

00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
if we continue to ignore the effects to
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
discuss what is possible
 
00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.070 align:start position:0%
discuss what is possible
um

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
and what is realistic short and long
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
term in terms of the trade-offs and the
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
costs then we're really shirking our
 
00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:00.789 align:start position:0%
costs then we're really shirking our
responsibility

00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
um at the expense of those who elected
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
us so it's our responsibility to figure
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
out what makes sense without
 
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
anyone in charge of energy policy so if
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's going to change it's great but i
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what the timing is going to
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
be of all that so i would recommend that
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
in order to help us make better
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
decisions and in order to make sure that
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
the conversation is furthered sooner
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
than later because i do i do feel like
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
we've been delaying a lot of this for a
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
long time without anybody in charge so i
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
was very excited to see uh
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
to see this bill come forward to just
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
say it's it's time for us to put the
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
effort in 30 seconds yup i'm good
 
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
effort in 30 seconds yup i'm good
thanks

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
oh okay well thank you uh take the 30
 
00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
oh okay well thank you uh take the 30
seconds

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
all right well i don't see any questions
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
for representative mcgee
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll move to our next speaker who is
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%

we are leadership uh
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
leadership new hampshire class of 2014
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
best class ever so i i have briefly i
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
actually think that representative mcgee
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
covered really what i wanted to talk
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
about in terms of a plan and not waiting
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just going to add a few extra
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
points to that um and thank you so much
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
that i i introduced this basically the
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
same bill in the senate because i think
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
that this is and that's senate bill 115
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
such an important um pro such an
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
important plan putting greenhouse gas
 
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.110 align:start position:0%
important plan putting greenhouse gas
emissions

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh the goals for them
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
into statute a new
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
climate action plan into statute giving
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
due regard um to the you know the
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
finances the the financial impact as we
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
move this forward
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
not only to local municipalities but to
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
businesses considering that
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know having an annual inventory is a
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
way of being accountable to not just the
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
present but to the future
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
and that this is amongst a number of
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
things it encourages private and public
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
investment opportunities um talks about
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
workforce development which is key um
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
and that is this engages state agencies
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
um in who work in this and with
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions projects in
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
incorporating this and integrating it
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
into all that they do
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
some of those are just the key pieces of
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
why i support having a comprehensive
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
plan putting it in statute and moving
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
forward i too am excited um and
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
impressed with bringing about a
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy but as
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee said
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
you know the time is now we can't wait
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
and i will i will close by saying
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
that there are parallel pandemics
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
happening not just in our in new
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire but in our nation in our world
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
and we in no way am i um lessening the
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
impact of coven 19 and how we face that
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
every day but climate was here before
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
that and our vaccination and our
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
strategy to mitigate
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the impacts of climate on
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
on our on our families and on our future
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
and our businesses is really a
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan integrated into state
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
government i so i applaud the work of
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
the sponsors i'm taking this up in the
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
senate and
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
i look forward to getting this work done
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
this year so thank you very much happy
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator apprentice and i
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
apologize for not recognizing you

senator for taking my call my question
um

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
can you tell us a little bit about how
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
you believe this bill would impact
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
positively your district economically
 
00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
positively your district economically
uh

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.430 align:start position:0%
uh
both

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
from the environmental perspective but
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
also from the job perspective
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i think
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to focus on the job
 
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
i'm going to focus on the job
perspective

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
we have a number of opportunities at
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
here in terms of
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know not just construction but in
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
bringing when we bring about action like
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
this and promoting
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
um the building of solar arrays um
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
actually new construction on homes and
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
on businesses we're bringing about green
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
jobs and it incorporates a workforce
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
development track which in in this
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
district in district five um this has
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
been a conversation that i've had with
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
many who are interested in terms of
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
keeping our
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
our youth
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
developing the trades for our youth and
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
seeing the green side to that um is is
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
an incredible value to us economically
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
so if we can keep the youth here build
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
the green jobs and we'll have a positive
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
impact on this is we're not just
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
building homes but building out other
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know other capacity and solar would
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
be one of those areas where whether it's
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
on a home or we have a project here in
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
this district it's over in on the
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
enfield lebanon line where a
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
solar array has been put in place and it
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
provides power to a mobile home park
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's a third-party not-for-profit
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
project and brought about jobs so
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's how i see it impacting the
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
economy here positively and it's wanted
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you senator seeing no additional
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%

but by way of uh background
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
context um there has there has been
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
similar legislation that was uh
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
presented last year that i believe it
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
died in the
 
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
died in the

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh situation that
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
affected all legislation last year
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.530 align:start position:0%

[Music]

has several activities that are required
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
of us in this legislation and while we
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
certainly recognize the need
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the importance of planning to
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
address climate change
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
here in the state um and our agency was
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
the agency that
 
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
the agency that
uh

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh coordinated and ultimately produced
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
the climate action plan uh of 2009 uh
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
under governor lynch's um executive
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
orders and
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
and uh with the uh 29-member climate
 
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
and uh with the uh 29-member climate
commission

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
um that plan and the plan that's
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
proposed here would require significant
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
effort on our department
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
um i'd just like to state that
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes currently receives no
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
general funds state funding
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
to uh support climate activities all
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
those activities are funded via two
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
mechanisms one is
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds uh epa
 
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:50.790 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.829 align:start position:0%
that uh
[Music]

00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
funds our general air pollution
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
activities and climate activities um
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
that we work in coordination with epa on
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
and another is a large environmental
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
settlement that occurred more than 10
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
and a national environmental settlement
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
polluter

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
polluter
 
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.109 align:start position:0%
polluter
and

00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire benefited from some of
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
those funds and we have applied those to
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
climate planning those funds mister
 
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.510 align:start position:0%
climate planning those funds mister
scotland

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
scotland
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
he's the only employee in the department
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
that has direct
 
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.550 align:start position:0%
that has direct
uh

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
full responsibilities for
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
climate planning activities
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
back in 2009
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
those federal funds funded 20 people
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
today they fund 12 people we've been
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
we've been level funded by the epa for
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years which is actually a
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
cut given that obviously every year
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
there are increases in salaries and
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
benefits and so on
 
00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:48.870 align:start position:0%
benefits and so on
so

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
um that climate plan that we worked on
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
in 2009 we were able to
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
utilize at times more than 10 department
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
staff um
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
that uh not all at the same time and and
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
so on but um certainly the equivalent of
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
two or three full-time staffers uh for a
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time we no longer
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
have those resources and so i think it's
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that again we
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
fully support and understand that this
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh planning is important and needs to
 
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
uh planning is important and needs to
occur

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we do not have the resources
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
necessary to implement this plan
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
um as proposed right now
 
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.829 align:start position:0%
um as proposed right now
and

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:31.839 --> 00:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
we also feel that we would benefit
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation would benefit from
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
funding for a consultant to address
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
economic impacts
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
planning for climate the 2009 climate
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
plan did
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh conclude that there was
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned by representative
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
oxenham in the beginning that there are
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
significant economic benefits that can
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
be realized from
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
from implementing climate planning and
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on renewable energy and other
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
other activities here in the state that
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
that can address climate
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
and um as was mentioned um
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
by representative sherman we do see um
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
in the coming years the state of new
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire is plateauing in terms of our
 
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.109 align:start position:0%
hampshire is plateauing in terms of our
emissions

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:22.710 align:start position:0%
emissions
we

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
we will stay fairly level without new
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
any new additional policies or planning
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
we we we think uh and also i would just
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
quickly address um the issue that was
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
raised with regards to the department of
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
energy and i would suggest suggest that
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
as this legislation goes forward um
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
there being it's an addition online uh
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
page three on line 27 and 28
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
that uh talks about des consulting with
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
other agencies and it repre it mentions
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
puc and osi
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
um you might want to consider adding
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
something to the effect of and other
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
state agencies as appropriate
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
um because there could potentially be a
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh as has been
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned and also probably bea would be
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
um an agency that would be of interest
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
for us to consult with in terms of
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
of uh jobs economic impact and that that
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
sort of activity um so with that uh
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
i will conclude if uh there are
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
questions for d yes either mr skoglund
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
or i would be happy to try to uh
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr fitzgerald the chair
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative knotter for a
 
00:41:37.839 --> 00:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative knotter for a
question

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman good morning
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
that i have i should have asked this
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative dr sherman um he said
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
that we have the
 
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.829 align:start position:0%
that we have the
cancer

00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the country and i'm wondering where i
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
can find the facts to back up that
 
00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.990 align:start position:0%
can find the facts to back up that
statement

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
quite alarming and i want to see the
 
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
quite alarming and i want to see the
proof

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
proof
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry it was somewhat difficult to
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
hear i i
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
i believe you were asking about um
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
increased cancer risk
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
is that the question
 
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.069 align:start position:0%
is that the question
um

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's a little
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
a little difficult but go ahead
 
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
a little difficult but go ahead
okay

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
dr sherman when he testified
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative sherman uh said that new
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire has the highest rates of
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
cancer in the country
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to see
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
look that up for myself i want to see
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
the proof of that statement because
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's very alarming
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i i know you can direct me
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
um we certainly can
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't have information right now but
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh as as uh senator sherman mentioned
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
the emissions commission the ad hoc
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
emissions commission that convened over
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
the summer and the fall
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
did address public health impacts to
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and received information from dr
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
katie bush and other representatives
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
from dhhs um that would be their purview
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
um and but i'd be happy to uh
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
to direct you to
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate source of that
 
00:43:13.119 --> 00:43:14.710 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate source of that
information

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
thomas for a question
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chair thank you mr
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
michelle for taking my question um i'm
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
just curious with century with des how
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
would you currently characterize uh
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's contribution to the us's
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh carbon emissions
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh president in terms of percentages do
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have any fingers on that
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
well generally uh
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
i i would say we can certainly provide
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
you with some information but generally
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions uh climate greenhouse
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
gas emissions are somewhat proportional
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
to population because it's it's uh
 
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:14.790 align:start position:0%
to population because it's it's uh
um

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know an
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh an impact of of human activities and
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
so it's cars it's it's businesses and so
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
on um we may have somewhat higher
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
emissions uh or did have somewhat higher
 
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.589 align:start position:0%
emissions uh or did have somewhat higher
emissions

00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
as a result of uh significant fossil
 
00:44:33.599 --> 00:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
as a result of uh significant fossil
fuel

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
energy production here in new hampshire
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
that was actually exported outside the
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
state for many years
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
that has that has reduced somewhat
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
um but we'd be happy to try to address
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
that and send you some information chris
 
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have any other
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that um
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah having looked at that pretty
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
recently due to senate bill 71
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 115 which both address
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh greenhouse gas emissions the per
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
capita emissions for new hampshire are
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than some states in
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
the u.s because that accounts for
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh the large amount of
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
coal oil and that and yes gas extraction
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's occurring in those states such as
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
wyoming and some of the midwestern
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
states compared to the states in
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
new england
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think we actually are just behind
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
almost all of the other states with the
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
exception of maine
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
but i can pass that along but compared
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the other states on a per
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
capita basis new hampshire
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
is probably in the top third
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
what would be your uh suggestion on how
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
such a climate action plan for new
 
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.790 align:start position:0%
such a climate action plan for new
hampshire

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.589 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
would be effective
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
given information that i'm aware of at
 
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
given information that i'm aware of at
least

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
as of since 2000 since the year 2000 up
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
to 2017
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
it appears that the us
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
as a nation had a 10 reduction in carbon
 
00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
as a nation had a 10 reduction in carbon
emissions

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
europe had mine had a 16 reduction but
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
china had 208 percent increase in carbon
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
emissions and india had 155 increase in
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions so how would you
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
characterize a climate action plan for
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of its effectiveness for
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
reducing carbon emissions given that the
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
u.s has apparently done a fairly decent
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
and certainly um i'm i'm not sure of the
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
source of of the information and and i i
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
won't question it certainly but um
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
i think that uh uh you know one of the
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
things that we look at is regional
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
activity uh and that and national
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
activity and we certainly um
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
believe that uh new hampshire needs to
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
play to play a role in uh the united
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
states continuing reduction of emissions
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the paris agreement
 
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.710 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the paris agreement
that

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
the united states was part of until
 
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.710 align:start position:0%
the united states was part of until
recently

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and most made
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
almost all every major
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh country and developing country in the
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
world as part of
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
does require certain reductions we may
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
have made reductions sooner than
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
than others but um reductions are
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
required uh of of those com countries i
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think it this needs to be looked at as
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
kind of an all hands on deck situation
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
every nation needs to
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
to do their part and we knew the united
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
states has been a major emitter for many
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
many years way beyond our and you know
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
on a per capita basis
 
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.430 align:start position:0%
um and
uh

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that we need to uh uh every
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
state all the new england states do our
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
part the the northeast as a region
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
represents about the 10th largest
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
economy in the world
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe even higher than that so
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
um i think i think it's a situation
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you i just might add that that
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
data came from the global carbon budget
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
again we don't question it i just i'm
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative uh
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you uh
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
mr fitzgerald and mr skoglen uh
 
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.309 align:start position:0%
mr fitzgerald and mr skoglen uh
uh

00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
is is it your estimation uh based on
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
your your knowledge of this topic that
 
00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:45.349 align:start position:0%
your your knowledge of this topic that
um

00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
places like china and india that are now
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
big emitters of greenhouse gases
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
are also among the
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
the forefront now of developing
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
technologies to reduce those things in
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
the way of clean technologies uh is
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that a bill like this
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
would help us focus opportunities
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
business opportunities here in new
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire that we could make use of uh
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
to address these issues
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
well certainly the 2009 climate plan
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
that was developed by a bipartisan
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission of 29 members from around the
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
state with academic
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
leaders and
 
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
leaders and
and

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
legislative and government
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
representatives and environmental
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
representatives it was quite a
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
cross-section and and very well
 
00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:35.990 align:start position:0%
cross-section and and very well
represented

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the uh of the state came to the
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion that um there were
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
significant opportunities in addressing
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
climate change and the policies
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of developing
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
other other types of programs presented
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
significant business opportunities
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i think i i i would agree i'm not an
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
expert and perhaps chris could could
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
address this a little bit more but i do
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
think that countries such as china um
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
are doing significant amounts of work
 
00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.510 align:start position:0%
are doing significant amounts of work
and

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
and working towards
 
00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
and working towards
significant

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
significant
um

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.710 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know plans for significant uh
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh climate emissions reductions
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
we we certainly have led the way at this
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
point in time chris do you have any
 
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
point in time chris do you have any
other

00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
context for this
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and i can do a little bit more uh
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
digging into this but it is my
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
understanding that while china did see
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
considerable growth and overtook the us
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
as the largest
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh gross emitter of greenhouse gas
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
emissions as representative
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
thomas mentioned between 2000 and 2018
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's now currently uh the
 
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.069 align:start position:0%
it's now currently uh the
the

00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
growing and largest market for electric
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
vehicles in in the world in part because
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
of the size of their population but also
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh their significant investment um and
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
innovation occurring there there's also
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
a great deal of solar deployment
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
occurring there as they're ramping up um
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
so they also recognize that there's a
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
public health component there's been
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
reporting on the impacts of
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
the that growth from 2000 to 2018 which
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
was coal based and the impacts that had
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
on air quality public health and they're
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
now moving more towards
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
cleaner cars and cleaner energy
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
generation um and i believe their
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
five-gear plan that they released pretty
 
00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:33.030 align:start position:0%
five-gear plan that they released pretty
recently

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
is focusing on de-carbonization heavily
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
it does take a while to move an economy
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
that size
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
but they're moving towards plateauing
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
all right follow-up
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh can you just confirm to me my
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of especially china that
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
china is currently the number one
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
producer of solar panels the number one
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
producer of electric vehicles and many
 
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.950 align:start position:0%
producer of electric vehicles and many
multi-million

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
multi-million
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
population cities now have electric
 
00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:08.950 align:start position:0%
population cities now have electric
buses

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
so the word confirm makes me a little
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
bit nervous um
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
that sounds consistent with what i have
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
been reading and i can look into that
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
and get back to you
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative mann is recognized
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
don't forget to thank you mr chair i
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
just finally figured that out
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm actually i'm going to make a
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
chris about what his feeling is about
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
this i'm surprised to see the concept of
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
were missing from both the um
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
the aspect of
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
reducing greenhouse gases and also from
 
00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:54.470 align:start position:0%
reducing greenhouse gases and also from
the

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
economic impact of so many jobs that
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
would would entail
 
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.950 align:start position:0%
would would entail
and

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
i had thought hopefully i guess
 
00:53:07.119 --> 00:53:08.630 align:start position:0%
i had thought hopefully i guess
that

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
any department of energy would be kind
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
of merged with
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
since uh
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
energy issue um
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think is about having enough
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
energy it's really about what source of
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
energy we
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
switch to
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
um representative man i'll i'll address
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
first uh
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
um you know i'm not sure
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
the first part of your question i
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
sounded to me like you were
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
asking why energy efficiency wasn't
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
addressed in this legislation is that
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
no no i'm just there was just i'm just
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
referring to the discussion so far we
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
haven't had any much mention of that
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
well we certainly see energy efficiency
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
as being being a critical part of
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
climate planning um
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
any climate plan including the one
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
produced in 2009 certainly significantly
 
00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.630 align:start position:0%
produced in 2009 certainly significantly
addressed

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
that need here in new hampshire
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh relative to the department of
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
energy i think we uh we will not comment
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
on that that's the governor's as was
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned by representative votes that's
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
purview um
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
as to uh how he wants to organize us
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
other states massachusetts and
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
connecticut in particular have emerged
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh environment energy department um but
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
that apparently is not the governor's
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
plan and and
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
i assume he'll be taking uh taking input
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
on that as that as this
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was an announcement in the budget
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
address and i'm not sure that
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
everything is fully fleshed out there
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
but that would be
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
certainly up to the governor's office
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
and how he constructs his budget
 
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts for a
 
00:54:58.559 --> 00:55:02.470 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts for a
question

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
this is along the same thing but do you
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
believe that perhaps these goal settings
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
better served in an energy commission
 
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
but that's where they should be
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the climate goals
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
that are in this in this bill yes sir
 
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.950 align:start position:0%
that are in this in this bill yes sir
yeah

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead uh again that would be a policy
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
call uh for the legislative
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh legislature and the uh
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh the governor if he chooses to uh if
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
this bill moves forward and he chooses
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
to sign it um i think certainly um there
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
was as senator sherman mentioned uh over
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
the course of the fall and summer uh
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
summer and fall there was a uh
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc climate emissions commission
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
and there is legislation i believe over
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
senate that would
 
00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:07.220 align:start position:0%
create a a commission to
 
00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.470 align:start position:0%
create a a commission to
[Music]

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.069 align:start position:0%
[Music]
address

00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
the adoption of climate goals so
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
there would need to be some
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
reconciliation between this legislation
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
and that if they both move forward
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
and mike if
 
00:56:20.559 --> 00:56:21.589 align:start position:0%
and mike if
yes

00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
could i add um
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the states like that have just
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
completed their climate planning uh such
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
as maine they established goals they
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
undertook a climate planning process as
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
in i believe section
 
00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:38.150 align:start position:0%
in i believe section
three

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
and four
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
but it was after they released the plan
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
just the in the past couple months
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
they're now
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
looking at that plan to determine
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
which policies does their legislature
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
need to put in place to actually move
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
forward that the plan itself has no
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
teeth and it's just a
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
process for considering what are the
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities what are the costs what
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
are the benefits how does it all fit
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
together to benefit the economy improve
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
public health and reduce greenhouse gas
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
emissions but it ultimately comes back
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the legislature for that
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
final implementation in statute to
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
determine um
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
which direction they ultimately would
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
like to move on based on what's in the
 
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.549 align:start position:0%
like to move on based on what's in the
plan

00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
so seeing no more questions that will be
 
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
allowed for these two speakers i would
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
have my hand up the whole time
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's true but as i indicated at the
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
beginning of this public hearing if
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
you're a co-sponsor of the bill
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
um you won't be
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
unless we have time and right now we
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
have nine other people
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak and we have one
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
minute left in this public hearing
 
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.630 align:start position:0%
minute left in this public hearing
so

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
if we have time representative mcgee i
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
will get back to you
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
but right now we need to call on our
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
next speaker but before i do that since
 
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.710 align:start position:0%
next speaker but before i do that since
the

00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
clock just turned over to 10 o'clock i'm
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
officially open the public hearing
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.069 align:start position:0%
on house bill
4

00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
87
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to recess that public
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
area mr chair before you recess
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
may ask a question how many people do we
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
have signed up for the next public
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
hearing the one you just opened
 
00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on the next public
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
hearing i think there's two
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
with that in mind we could give a little
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
extra to this hearing and recognize that
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
the next one is going to be short but
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
just pay attention
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
all right so the next person that i'd
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
like to call on to speak is karen luther
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
she is a member of the public
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
representing her association which is
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
ehpba.org and i'm sure she will tell us
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
just exactly what that is
 
00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.829 align:start position:0%
just exactly what that is
so

00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%

we recognize the changing landscape of
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
the energy and fossil fuel industry and
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're committed to working with
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
government officials and regulators at
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
all levels to increase access to more
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
sustainable and climate-centric fuel

sources
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
however moving quickly and rationally to
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
net zero
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
that eliminates fossil fuels could
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
result in skyrocketing electric rates
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
and potentially inhibit access to more
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
affordable sources of fuel and power
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
negatively affecting the most vulnerable
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
around us
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
nepa is very concerned with the
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
statement replacing fossil fuels with
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
zero emission sources of energy already
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
has already this season we've had three
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
weather related power outages that have
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
had homes and business owners relying on
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
gas and wood more importantly the
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
elimination of fossil fuels will
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate the last of these
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
aforementioned mom and pop family owned
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
and operated small businesses in the
 
01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
and operated small businesses in the
state

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
the possible new jobs that may be
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
created are not transferable and would
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
not be available to these business
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
owners who rely on the sales and
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
installation in service of gas and wood
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
fueled heating and decorative appliances
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
the elimination of home heating oil
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
would be particularly burdensome and
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
expensive to taxpayers
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're concerned on multiple levels about
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
the hyper focus on electrification
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire 51 percent of
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
homes rely on fuel oil as the primary
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
heating source the second largest after
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
maine i have that source 19.8 percent of
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
homes are heated with util utility gas
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
and many homes in new hampshire use wood
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
heat as supplemental heating i also have
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
that source
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
allowing homeowners energy choice and
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
energy diversity
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
is important in the northeast where
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
below freezing temperatures and power
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
outages as a result of winter weather
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
are very common additionally natural gas
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas and properly
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
burning wood can decrease emissions
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
allow for energy choice and keep costs
 
01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.670 align:start position:0%
allow for energy choice and keep costs
down

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
i also have the source regarding the
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles that was mentioned
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
earlier today in tesla volkswagen and
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
renault are the three high
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
largest manufacturers of electric cars
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the world and i can give you guys
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
that source if you're interested that
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
was just a side note
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
i thank you very much for your
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
consideration of my comments today and i
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate your time and thank
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much mrs mister are
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
there any questions i see uh
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
miss luther for your testimony
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
as someone who actually has
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
grill and barbecue equipment that runs
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
on electricity
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
i don't see this as being that dangerous
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
for a business association
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
affiliated with these things but what
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about is you mentioned
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
that you expect skyrocketing electric
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
rates to happen uh because of this
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
legislation can you explain why that
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
well sure if there if there's an
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
elimination of fuel source right if you
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
go only to one fuel one
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
one seller there's that eliminates
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
competition in in the marketplace and
 
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.510 align:start position:0%
competition in in the marketplace and
additionally

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
um it there's there's an enormous uh
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
fees of tap taxes on electricity at this
 
01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
fees of tap taxes on electricity at this
point

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.230 align:start position:0%
point
um

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
but but it
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's basically based on the fact of
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating competition right and also
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and states devise their
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
own electric plants and can then control
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
the cost of of that electricity without
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
a competitive market
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
i i hear what you're saying but you know
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
our utilities are regulated utilities
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
they all get their electricity from a
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
wholesale market in new england uh those
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
rates are
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
the ultimate rates are going to be
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
determined by the cost of energy and
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look like it's going to
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
skyrocket anytime soon i i'm kind of
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
surprised about your comment uh that's
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's a comment that's
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
a consideration across the country with
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
the with the um concern for
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
electrification and i would be so happy
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
to um to to give you to just be able to
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
send you some resources and some some uh
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
some some information that we have on
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
that with sources
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
how how can i i can find your your email
 
01:04:04.079 --> 01:04:05.029 align:start position:0%
how how can i i can find your your email
address

01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
website correct
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's correct happy to get back to you
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for the question
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative thomas for a question
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
i guess my question uh
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
filter to
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
further your point
 
01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:26.549 align:start position:0%
further your point
uh

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:27.349 align:start position:0%
uh
your

01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
statement about
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
rising electric costs would be cost
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to certain people
 
01:04:33.039 --> 01:04:34.549 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to certain people
um

01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
just like would you would you
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
my example that i'm going to give you is
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
this the type of example that that you
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
refer to for instance a month and a half
 
01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
refer to for instance a month and a half
ago

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
i tried to heat my home with more of my
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
electric heaters and electric um
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
baseboards to see what would happen and
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
i came out with a 510 electric bill
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
following month i took them off and went
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
back my propane heat and i was paying
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
about two hundred dollars for my
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
electric heats is this type of example
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
that you were referring to about the
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
huge cost of electricity that could
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
occur that's exactly correct um because
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
the it's
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's well known that electric heat is
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
just not as efficient and below 30
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
degrees i also have these sources for
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
you if anybody is interested below 30
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
degrees heat pumps
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
are are very inefficient without an
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
alternate and or a supplemental source
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
of heat
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
and is very expensive to heat a home in
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
new england in these cold temperatures
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial was
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes i do need to ask your source for
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
your uh heat exchange i got my heat
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
exchange unit works down to 13 below
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
and it heats my house efficiently
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
for equivalent of what representative
 
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.470 align:start position:0%
for equivalent of what representative
thompson

01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
thompson
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
thomas says his house heated for
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
i would also question you lumping
 
01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
bumping a wooden uh with your other
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels as what is generally
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
considered to be carbon neutral
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it is i thank you for saying that i
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um and i'm glad that you
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
understand that a lot of legislature i
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
did put i did add that in and you're
 
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.470 align:start position:0%
did put i did add that in and you're
right

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
and um because a lot of times when this
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
conversation starts uh it ends up
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
eventually evolving in in including wood
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm very happy that you that you
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
said that and i thank you for making
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
and the point about your heat exchanges
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
i i i can't i can't even imagine that
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
that heat so i i want to know the the
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's well known i mean in new in
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
burlington i'm suspicious of well-known
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
i have to say no listen uh sorry i
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you uh in in
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
burlington vermont they built a an
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
apartment building that relied solely on
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
heat pumps it was all electric and in
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
december they couldn't get the interior
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
temperature above 30 degrees fahrenheit
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
and had to evacuate the apartment
 
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.349 align:start position:0%
and had to evacuate the apartment
building

01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much see no further

very much for uh talking to us today so
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
we'll call on our next speaker now who
 
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
we'll call on our next speaker now who
is

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
justin cates a member of the public
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
who's representing the city of nashua
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire office of energy
 
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.829 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire office of energy
management

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
that seems like a lot of
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks to represent but mr cates
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead you have three minutes
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
thanks uh just as a clarification of the
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
city of natural office of emergency
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
management not affiliated with the state
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
energy management
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
so my name is justin kates i'm the
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
director of emergency management for the
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
city of nashville and my area of
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
expertise is in dealing with the
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
consequences of the extreme
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
precipitation events flooding drought
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
heat waves
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
many of the other perils that are
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
discussed in this bill
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's many that are more qualified to
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
discuss the sources and impacts of
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions as well as the
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
health and financial benefits of
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
reducing these emissions but what i want
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
to comment on today is the opportunity
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
to use greenhouse goals in conjunction
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
with a robust climate action plan that
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
invests in strategies to promote a more
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
disaster resilient new hampshire
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
in 2018 in the city of nashville we led
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
a community-wide resilient nashua
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
initiative which updated our hazard
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan and identified long-term
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
strategies to prepare for future climate
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
risks while reducing greenhouse gas
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
emissions and this plan recommended the
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
adoption of the nashua energy and
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
environment committee's goals which
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
included a reduction of
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
school municipal building and
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure greenhouse gas emissions
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
by 25 by 2025 the reduction of municipal
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle emissions by 25 percent by 2025
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
and the school municipal system will
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
derive 100 of its energy from renewable
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
clean energy sources by 2050 and these
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
goals were adopted by the mayor and
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen in 2019 and we're now
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
working towards the city's master plan
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
update which includes an overarching
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
priority to protect the climate
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
when we look at this topic we typically
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
break the strategies down into two areas
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
climate mitigation and climate
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
adaptation and climate mitigation looks
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
climate adaptation looks to adjust and
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
modify our behaviors and built
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
environment to deal with the coming
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
health and safety hazards exacerbated by
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
climate adaptation has been and will
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
continue to be very expensive there are
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
some benefits to adaptation especially
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
when considering the use of natural
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
solutions such as green storm water
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
strategies to support our aging storm
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
water infrastructure but overall it's
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
challenging to get an immediate positive
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
return on adaptation investments when
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
you think about it you're replacing
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
retrofitting and even removing
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and buildings
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
that may function perfectly fine under
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
our current normal conditions something
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
that many are going to have heartburn
 
01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
that many are going to have heartburn
over

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's why during the resilient natural
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
initiative we discovered that the
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
majority of our adaptation investment
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
would likely be on new and end-of-life
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
span construction projects or during
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
reconstruction after a disaster and the
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
common example is when a culvert has
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
reached the end of its life we'll see if
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
it needs to be built to pass more water
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
through or if it's damaged during a
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
flood we'll see
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
if that's an opportunity to build it
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
back better and adaptation is necessary
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
but we'll continue to build stronger
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
buildings and infrastructure to deal
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
with these hazardous conditions
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
on the other hand climate mitigation
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
does have the opportunity to provide
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
significant co-benefits particularly in
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
the creation of a secure and resilient
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
energy system here in the granite state
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire climate action plan
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
could leverage substantial opportunities
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
to mitigate emissions using distributed
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
and energy efficient appliances and
 
01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
and energy efficient appliances and
services

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
and when we think about if we look at
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
the construction of renewable energy
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
sources plus battery storage there's an
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create distributed energy
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that we're less reliant on uh the
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any questions for
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
mr cates i see representative sams that
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
mr kate for taking my question um uh i
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm really impressed by the the the um
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
forward movement that the city of nashua
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
is doing and i can understand how you
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
have uh you have to make some priorities
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
of what what you can and cannot do could
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
you explain to us a little bit of how
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
the city of nashua is funding these
 
01:12:11.679 --> 01:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
the city of nashua is funding these
efforts

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
so it depends on the circumstance and
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
what type of investments being made for
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
many of the renewable energy sources
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
solar panels on roofs of municipal
 
01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.270 align:start position:0%
solar panels on roofs of municipal
buildings

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's being funded through city funding
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
we would expect that in the
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
coming years there may be additional
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal grant opportunities to pay for
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
some of these types of capabilities but
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
right now we're funding this through
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
municipal budget
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
chair

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.189 align:start position:0%
chair
uh

01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative homura
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and uh thank you for
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
presenting your information i'm actually
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
a hazard mitigation plan reviewer so i
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you do as an emergency
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
manager very much uh the one question i
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
had is that you had mentioned that
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
nashua actually contends obviously with
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
precipitation issues i'm assuming
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
flooding issues can you tell me if the
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
city of nashua has been able to
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
utilize any projects through the hmgp
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
program the grant program federal grant
 
01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:15.430 align:start position:0%
program the grant program federal grant
program

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh we have we have not um we've applied
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the past for funding through hmgp
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
that has a mitigation grant program uh
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
but the the challenging problem that we
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
deal with is in many cases the areas
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing impacts to culverts
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
and other um infrastructure around
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
floodways uh the benefit cost analysis
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for us to replace those
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
components of infrastructure uh with a
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
significant benefit to uh the financial
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
impacts of the city so we never
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
typically are able to
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
to receive those grants because there
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
are other projects around the state
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
that are are better investments for that
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you very much
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
for answering that question um if you
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
haven't really seen a positive bca on
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
some of these hmgp grants i'm just
 
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
some of these hmgp grants i'm just
wondering

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
how you see
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
more long-term esoteric
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
mitigation through this bill
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
well i think the number one area that we
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
would look at when talking about in my
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
case distributed renewable energy is uh
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
there's an ability to leverage
 
01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:24.950 align:start position:0%
there's an ability to leverage
uh

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
as an example solar plus battery storage
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
at our critical municipal facilities
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
that have a daily financial
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh as well as
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
resilience impact
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
those systems would be used every day
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
in comparison to something that might be
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
funded through a hazard mitigation
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
program like this standby generator
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
which would sit there and not be used
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
unless there's a power outage so
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
the the reason we're focusing on on
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
concepts like we're talking about today
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
is is there's a benefit
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
daily that we can leverage these systems
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh the co benefits are significant in
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%

has been emailed to you
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
it is extremely concerning for our state
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
that data from the national oceanic and
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
atmospheric administration shows new
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
england to be one of the fastest warming
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
regions in the country
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's average temperatures
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
have increased by nearly 3 degrees
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
fahrenheit in comparison to 20th century
 
01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
fahrenheit in comparison to 20th century
levels

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
changing climates have enabled invasive
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
species to migrate to and thrive in new
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire's water and land disrupting
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
the balance of our ecosystems and sea
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
level rise due to climate change is
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
posed to ravage our sea coast
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
the good news is that we have the
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
frameworks the plans the technology and
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
the science to address the climate
 
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.149 align:start position:0%
the science to address the climate
crisis

01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize that climate change
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
is more than just a political issue
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
it is an issue impacting what kind of
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
future i and all other youth will be
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
able to aspire to
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
the science has been clear for decades
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
exxonmobil knew about the severe
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
environmental dangers of fossil fuels
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
long before i was born they commissioned
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
a study on it in 1979
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
and yet though we know it is effectively
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
a death sentence for our planet
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
eventually we have continued to allow
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
emissions to go unchecked at the
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
unprecedented global rate of 40 billion
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
tons per year
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
if we neglect to take action i will be
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
only 25 when it is estimated that the
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
damage from climate change will be
 
01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.669 align:start position:0%
damage from climate change will be
irreversible

01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
irreversible
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
by the time i'm old enough to run for
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
office myself it could be too late
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
30 seconds this is my third year in a
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
row testifying for environmental
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and my second year
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
submitting testimony for a bill creating
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
a climate action plan i will keep coming
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
back year after year however long it
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
takes until i see action because i know
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
that passing legislation like this as
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
well as increasing funding to relevant
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
departments will enable the change we
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
need for our state my generation and our
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
planet thank you
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we appreciate your
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
testimony here today
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative thompson you have your
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
yes it is mr chairman you're recognized
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh and uh thank you and miss andrando
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify
 
01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify
um

01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's always refreshing and uh
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
encouraging for all of us to hear from
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
young people testifying and making this
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
effort um
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
however it's also important that
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
everybody take personal responsibility
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
for these things so i'd like to ask you
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
whether what you and your peers are
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
doing to take action on your own
 
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.430 align:start position:0%
doing to take action on your own
uh

01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
talking to your parents or making
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
improvements in your home or doing other
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
behaviors that will benefit our
 
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
behaviors that will benefit our
environment

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for that question
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
my peers are all very concerned about
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
climate change and we've been organizing
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
particularly on the legislative front to
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
make sure our voices are heard
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
on these bills i've also organized two
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
climate marches in the past years that
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
have brought hundreds of people from
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
across the state together to advocate
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the climate
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
i personally have switched to a lot of
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
zero-waste alternatives i carry reusable
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives to things like straws and
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
bags with me wherever i go and have also
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
been discussing with my parents about
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency alternatives for our
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
house in the future
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think one thing that we've all really
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
been focusing on is
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
learning more ourselves because
 
01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.669 align:start position:0%
learning more ourselves because
occasionally

01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
the climate crisis is not taught in
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
school so
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
this is something that many of my peers
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
are passionate about and educating
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves and others about and hoping to
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
see action on in the future
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh miss strondau are you aware
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the fact that everyone including your
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
parents or any resident in new hampshire
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
can now choose
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
energy supply that is 100 renewable by
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
choosing an energy supplier on the pucs
 
01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
choosing an energy supplier on the pucs
website

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%

brought it up to my parents it's
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%

01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%

read into this hearing
it's

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
so important to hear all of that science
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
but i want to talk about love and how
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
much this bill is about preserving the
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
world that we love
 
01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:03.990 align:start position:0%
world that we love
preserving

01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire that we love
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
preserving skiing in new hampshire
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
preserving the beaches that we love in
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire preserving the apple crop
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
preserving the blueberry crop in new
 
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
preserving the blueberry crop in new
hampshire

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
all of those things have been harmed
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
already by climate change
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
we love those things where
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
we need to take this action
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
i live in portsmouth and i walk by a
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
tidal pond
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
many times a week and i
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
and i can see as the sea levels rise
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
um the businesses and the homes that
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
will be affected by that rising water
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
says that we love this coast in this
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
town and that we want to take action to
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
change that and i think that we need the
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
discipline of um and the accountability
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
of shared laws
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
to help us mitigate that damage
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
in our state and in our world we're
 
01:24:00.629 --> 01:24:00.639 align:start position:0%
hearing more and more climate events
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
around the world and we want to be part
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
of solving that problem
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
i am keenly aware that one of the things
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
that will have to happen for us to meet
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
these carbon goals is that we will have
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
to stop burning coal in new hampshire
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
15 seconds
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that that will mean creating good
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
jobs for people
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
for the future
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%

uh as a pastor
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
do you think there is also a moral and
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
religious obligation component
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
to this issue
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
all of us should consider
 
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
all of us should consider
absolutely

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
i think the the moral and religious
 
01:24:58.239 --> 01:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
i think the the moral and religious
issue

01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
comes down to love which is why i spoke
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
about love
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
all of the world religions teach us to
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
love our neighbor and to love the world
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to do that we have to
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
take good and thoughtful care of it
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:18.370 align:start position:0%

jackie kelly fitz you're recognized for
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask quickly was
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
i understand your uh
 
01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
point on stewardship but what will this
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
do to people who cannot
 
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
do to people who cannot
reduce

01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
such as people in apartments and
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
where there's going to be no will this
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
have an effect on them
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
the goals we set will have to affect
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely everyone and that's why we
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
have to do the work together we can't
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
send people off to solve problems
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
individually and that's that's why we
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
make laws so that we do things together
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
and make the choices together and
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
support people who will have uh meet
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%

judith psalm
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
i am a voter in romney and i do not
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent any organization
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
my husband and i consider ourselves
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
climate migrants
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
we locate relocated from new hampshire
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire from reno nevada in
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
2018 because of the increasing climate
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
change related wildfires
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
and because the associated smoke was
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
impacting our health and our quality of
 
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.430 align:start position:0%
impacting our health and our quality of
life

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes there were weeks at a time
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
when we could not spend any time
 
01:27:40.719 --> 01:27:42.310 align:start position:0%
when we could not spend any time
outdoors

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
outdoors
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
because of the smoke
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
i suffered from sinus infections we had
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty breathing
 
01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.709 align:start position:0%
difficulty breathing
and

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
after living decades in the west and for
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
my husband he left lived his whole life
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the west we decided we had to leave
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
while we did not expect to escape
 
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
climate change entirely by moving to new
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are alarmed
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
to see climate climate change happening
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
so quickly here
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
during last summer's drought
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
we became aware that wildflower
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
wildfires are a significant threat in
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
this state as well
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
we also understand that the new
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire moose population is
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
sadly diminishing due to a tick species
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
that thrives because of climate change
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
local farmers who serve our community uh
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
such as our neighbors
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
down the road at longview farm now are
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
struggling to grow produce with the
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
climate change-related weather extremes
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
like drought flooding and the terrible
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
hail storm that occurred last summer
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
my husband and i recently viewed the
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
beautiful netflix documentary called the
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
life on our planet by david attenborough
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
the famed naturalist
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
in which he explores the mass
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
destruction of species during his
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
lifetime in relation to the increase of
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
atmospheric carbon
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
mr attenborough's take-home message is
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
that the issue is no longer about saving
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
species saving the planet
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
the primary issue is about saving
 
01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.470 align:start position:0%
the primary issue is about saving
ourselves

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
as he points out
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
we must take action to drastically
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
reduced reduce greenhouse gas emissions
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
while we still have time
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
therefore i urge you to support hb 172 i
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
would point out that comparable
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
legislation has been already passed in
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
other states with bipartisan support
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
including in nevada which made it a law
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
in 2019.
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
so again please support this legislation
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
and move it forward thank you for your
 
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.510 align:start position:0%
and move it forward thank you for your
time

01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay we'll now move on to our next
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
speaker who is
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute yourself yes i'm
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
there can you hear me now mr chairman
 
01:30:06.639 --> 01:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
there can you hear me now mr chairman
yes

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm today offering oral
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
testimony to uh
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
in support of house bill 172 i've also
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
my reason for support of the bill are as
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
follows house bill 172 requires new
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to establish a climate action
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
plan that will reset
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
public policy among other requirements
 
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
to reduce statewide greenhouse gas
 
01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:29.270 align:start position:0%
to reduce statewide greenhouse gas
emissions

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
the plan will also set goals and
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
actually inventory greenhouse gas
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
emissions will be key which will be key
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
saying these reductions are necessary if
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
there's any chance for new hampshire to
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
begin to meet the climate change
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
emergency of the state of new hampshire
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
now and will face into the future
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
failure to meet these reductions within
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
the prescribed schedules will certainly
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
present our citizens with a
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
progressively degraded environment
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
research by our university scientists
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
indicates that we're currently
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
experiencing climate change with shorter
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
winters warmer summers
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
rising sea levels and unpredictable
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
rainfall and drought conditions
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
all these factors contribute to a
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
degraded environment here and now
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
the impact of these changes currently
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
cause adverse impacts including
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
financial on new hampshire's
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
agricultural production
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
tourism industry and our seasonal sports
 
01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.310 align:start position:0%
tourism industry and our seasonal sports
attractions

01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
attractions
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
and these adverse impacts will continue
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
to worse into the future
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
after a number of fall spa starts over
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
the last decade it is time for new
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire to begin to take meaningful
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
action to meet the challenge of climate
 
01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.830 align:start position:0%
action to meet the challenge of climate
change

01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation is desperately needed
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
especially in light of the current
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposals in the legislature to either
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
delay or dilute rational and worthwhile
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
initiatives such as the energy
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency resource standard in the
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today and this
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
bill is needed now and should pass thank
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
you i will take questions
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
you succeeded in testifying in a minute
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
35 seconds
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
practice makes perfect
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative samsich
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
kwasnik for your testimony
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell us uh in any way that
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
climate change has impacted you directly
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes from the recreational point of
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
view it has i'm a skier
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
both cross country and alpine and we're
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
finding that the winters winters are
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
quite becoming shorter
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
the ski season is starting later in the
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
year and ending earlier in the year
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
so that's an impact on me i also um
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
do quite a bit of hiking and i am
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
terribly concerned about the infestation
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
of ticks and other invasive species that
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
have now invaded our our state uh as a
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
child that never occurred or even
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
came across these types of species
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
before so we're seeing just an
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
incredible migration of invasive species
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
not only plant but also animal
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
and insect into our communities so yes
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
had a lot of impact on me
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay see no
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
further questions um
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
we will move to our
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
last speaker of the day
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
there were two people signed up
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
mary dean
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%

01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
available mr chair i believe elinda

thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee members of the science
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
technology energy committee for hearing
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony in favor of hp 172. i'm
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
here as a private citizen but i'm also
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state coordinator for new hampshire
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
citizens climate lobby a grassroots
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization working to help
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
create the political will to enable
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
congress to legislate cash back carbon
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
pricing to efficiently and equitably
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
reduce climate pollution in the us and
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
around the world
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to provide some insight into
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
national and global factors that provide
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
support for this bill
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
to help avoid government waste
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
we ignore the changing global energy
 
01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
we ignore the changing global energy
market

01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
at our peril um we will make bad
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
decisions and poor investments if we
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
don't pay attention to major changes
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
that are happening beyond our control
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
that will affect us but first i would
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
like to respond to representative
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
thomas's question about what would it
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
matter if new hampshire goes to next
 
01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
matter if new hampshire goes to next
zero

01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
while it's true that our emissions
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
are a small percentage of the whole
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
um if everybody thinks the same way
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
noble nobody would reduce their
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
emissions so
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
ignoring your own pollution is called
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
free loading or free riding
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's just not a responsible way to
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
behave um
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
but even more than that the us is
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for 25 percent of global
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
climate pollution that's in the air
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
we developed our industry burning fossil
 
01:35:31.679 --> 01:35:33.189 align:start position:0%
we developed our industry burning fossil
fuels

01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
fuels
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
the world has paid from our pollution in
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
his pain
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
but we have a bigger than average
 
01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
but we have a bigger than average
responsibility

01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
per capita uh the u.s is four times more
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
polluting than average um comparing us
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
to climate china is interesting the
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
average american pollutes twice as much
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
carbon pollution as the average person
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
in china
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then there are 100 million people in
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
china that still don't have any power so
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
while china plugs those power into the
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
grid um they are trying to reduce
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
emissions but they obviously have a
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
the ipcc world bank world economic forum
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
all say a carbon price is needed to
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
address this global pollution problem
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
that is moving forward rapidly
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
james uh
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%

thank you mr gage we appreciate your
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh we will read your

voluminous written testimony as part of
the

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%

record for this
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
for this public hearing

and so with that seeing no more uh
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
speakers lined up mr chairman i have my
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
hands raised
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%

my question uh i if i'm not mistaken
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
your organization has been affiliated
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
a carbon pricing plan that is bipartisan
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
on both political sides and economic
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
side can you say something about that is
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%

your question
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
um yes so the organization is 14 years
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
old they found this policy called carbon
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
fee and dividend with board adjustments
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago we've been lobbying
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
congress to introduce it
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
it has been introduced as a bipartisan
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
bill with 87 co-sponsors it will reduce
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
u.s emissions by 40 percent in 12 years
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
and 90 percent and 30 by putting a
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
steadily increasing price on carbon
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
emissions at the source by charging
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels thank you you answered
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative samsich's question so
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%

and uh so with that we closed the
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb
 
01:38:21.239 --> 01:38:22.790 align:start position:0%

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we moved to the next bill
 
01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.470 align:start position:0%
and we moved to the next bill
which

01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
whose public hearing i opened at

sponsor of the bill
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
which is about establishing an
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
information technology supply chain risk
 
01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.550 align:start position:0%
information technology supply chain risk
authority

01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
nice representative samsich to introduce
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i have a point of order
 
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.350 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i have a point of order
please

01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
certainly what's your point of order
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
my my question was not to add any
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
testimony to the bill my question was
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
whether there needed to be an fn on the
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
last bill which i think
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
i was going to pose that question to the
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
because their testimony included not
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
only a consultant but three ftes so my
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
question is a really a process or
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
technical one which is whether or not
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 172 requires an fn
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you to that question
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that question typically
 
01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:28.149 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that question typically
ols

01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
ols
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
is the agency that decides whether a
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
bill needs a fiscal note or not
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh since they did not make that judgment
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
on the bill when they drafted it
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
i assume it doesn't really need one but
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
so now i'll recognize uh representatives
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%

01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
my original intent for this for the
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill was based on
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
my concerns regarding the security of
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
our state's state government's networks
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the products and services
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:20.709 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire is
procuring

01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
procuring
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh approximately two years ago i worked
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
with the state's director for it dennis
 
01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:26.629 align:start position:0%
with the state's director for it dennis
goulet

01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
goulet
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
on a bill
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
since passed by governor sununu and
 
01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.030 align:start position:0%
since passed by governor sununu and
signed

01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
signed
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
that prohibited the state agencies from
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
using software developed by kaspersky
 
01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.270 align:start position:0%
using software developed by kaspersky
lab

01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
lab
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
kaspersky lab software is most
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
frequently used as an antivirus and
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
cyber security protection
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
at that time many state agencies
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country as well as
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
the us government were in fact still
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
using that software
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
recently i have been become aware of a
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
number of products and services being
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
offered by companies
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
associated with governments that have
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
been accused of cyber security and
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
hacking threats against the u.s
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
government and governments abroad
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
such countries include the people's
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
republic of china russia north korea and
 
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.189 align:start position:0%
republic of china russia north korea and
iran

01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
iran
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
the main attraction for such products
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
and services has been the fact that they
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
are offer often offered at a
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
considerably lower price than their
 
01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.430 align:start position:0%
considerably lower price than their
competition

01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.430 align:start position:0%
competition
um

01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
i i discussed these concerns
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
i discussed these concerns with director
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
goulet who confirmed who informed me
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
that his department had been working on
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
these issues and would be willing to
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
suggest elements that they felt were
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
important to include in any such bill
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
his department worked with the ols to
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
draft the bill before you today
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
however upon closer scrutiny and based
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
on more recent cyber security threats it
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
is the opinion of his i.t department
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
that the bill before you today is not
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
yet ready to be acted on uh director
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
goulet will be testifying and explaining
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
his reasoning for this today
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
however based on his recommendation i
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'll be asking this committee to vote to
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
retain this bill until further
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
improvements can be made to it
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%

01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%

um i t supply chain issues are
 
01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.910 align:start position:0%
um i t supply chain issues are
are

01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
with us and look like they will be with
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
us for the future
 
01:43:44.639 --> 01:43:45.750 align:start position:0%
us for the future
the

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
kaspersky legislation that we worked on
 
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.109 align:start position:0%
kaspersky legislation that we worked on
together

01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:43:49.119 --> 01:43:50.310 align:start position:0%
together
was

01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know a true example of a contained
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
i.t supply chain issue
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
and when representative samsift came to
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
us we we talked about what we're doing
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the state already in this space
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we have been for about six months
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
now working with the department of
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the attorney
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
to work on um changes to our procurement
 
01:44:14.719 --> 01:44:16.149 align:start position:0%
to work on um changes to our procurement
methodologies

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
methodologies
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to filter out um and
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
manage to uh against supply chain risk
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
as part of the technology procurement
 
01:44:24.719 --> 01:44:26.310 align:start position:0%
as part of the technology procurement
process

01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
and although that's a good step and we
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
will keep doing that
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
i think we you know in the end we should
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
have legislation
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i thought that at this time was the
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
right time to do that
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
and was looking forward to working on
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
said legislation with uh representative
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
samsich however since then the solar
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
winds attack has happened
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
we are still at this moment learning
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
about how that was executed
 
01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
about how that was executed
and

01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
but there are significant parts of it
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
that are not yet public they're being
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
withheld by the federal government
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
under top secret status
 
01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.149 align:start position:0%
under top secret status
so

01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
we're thinking that um you know the
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
world that we thought we lived in isn't
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
the world we actually are in with
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
respect to ig supply chain risk
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
so at this time
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling that we could retain or
 
01:45:20.719 --> 01:45:22.470 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling that we could retain or
itl

01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
that i'm ambivalent on that whatever the
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee would would
 
01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.870 align:start position:0%
committee would would
prefer

01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
and that i continue to work with
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
ag's office on language in requests for
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
proposal and final contracts
 
01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.149 align:start position:0%
proposal and final contracts
that

01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:42.159 --> 01:45:43.030 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
begin to address this issue but we also
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
work on language we i will take
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
working on an evolving language over the
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
next year or so so in the next session
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can have something we'd be
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that would would better
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
address the new realities we live in
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the new kinds of
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
threats we're seeing from foreign actors
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
as it relates to i.t supply chain risk
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
that concludes my formal testimony and
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
i'm ready for questions
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr goulet we really appreciate
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
you being here and testifying today so
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
if i understood what you said correctly
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
you think that it could take
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
as long as a year to get the language
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill correct
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore you wouldn't
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
object to an itl
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
motion on this bill for this year so we
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
can bring a fresh bill forward next year
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay well good i appreciate you being
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
candid about that uh we do have an
 
01:46:46.639 --> 01:46:48.550 align:start position:0%
candid about that uh we do have an
extremely

01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:50.149 align:start position:0%
extremely
crowded

01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
crowded
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
schedule for dealing with retained bills
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
we've retained quite a few already
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
and i know we will be retaining several
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
more so
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
we have to be very very careful that we
 
01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:02.229 align:start position:0%
we have to be very very careful that we
don't

01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
retain so many bills that we get totally
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
during a fairly short
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
period of time that we have allocated
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
for doing that work so we appreciate
 
01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.229 align:start position:0%
for doing that work so we appreciate
that

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%

01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee does anybody have
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
any additional questions that they would
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
like to address through
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%

01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
call this public hearing to a close
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
before doing that i'll report that
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%

colleagues renewable energy certificates
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
known as rex represent the energy
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
generated by renewable energy sources
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
one wreck represents one megawatt hour
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
of electricity generation
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
wrecks can be bought and sold but once
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
sold the renewable attributes of that
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
energy production are transferred from
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
purchasing rex supports the renewable
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
energy market by providing a demand
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
signal to the market which in turn
 
01:59:15.910 --> 01:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
encourages greater supply of renewable
 
01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.950 align:start position:0%
encourages greater supply of renewable
energy

01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
in this way wrecks not only help towns
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
businesses and individuals meet their
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emission goals they also
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
encourage the generation of more
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
however in new hampshire we have enabled
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
a unique and i would suggest a uniquely

perverse mechanism to operate and that
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
is known as wreck
 
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:44.950 align:start position:0%
is known as wreck
sweeping

01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
rec sweeping allows new hampshire
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
electric providers to seize without
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
payment and without their knowledge the
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
renewable energy attributes produced by
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
other new hampshire businesses and
 
01:59:58.800 --> 01:59:59.990 align:start position:0%
other new hampshire businesses and
residents

01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
and to use those wrecks to meet the
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
utilities or the generators own
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard obligations
 
02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
this practice constitutes a government
 
02:00:11.679 --> 02:00:12.629 align:start position:0%
this practice constitutes a government
seizure

02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
seizure
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
and transfer of private property without
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
just compensation and therefore violates
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
the fifth amendment of the u.s
 
02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:22.070 align:start position:0%

02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
passing h.b 396 would abolish the rec

and it would put an end to this serious
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
infringement of new hampshire's citizens
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
so-called rec sweeping allows the
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
electricity producer to claim the wrecks
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy self-generation
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
from those residents and businesses who
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
choose not to register their wrecks
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
this means new hampshire residents
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
cannot claim or represent their
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
self-produced electric energy output is
 
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.310 align:start position:0%
self-produced electric energy output is
renewable

02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
not even the portion they physically
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
consume for their own use behind the
 
02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:12.149 align:start position:0%
consume for their own use behind the
meter

02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
this deprives the wreck markets of their
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
largest source of demand the utilities
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
and electricity generators who have rps
 
02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:23.350 align:start position:0%
and electricity generators who have rps
obligations

02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
so as a result not only are our citizens
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
our towns and our businesses losing
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
their property rights but we've also
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
wrecked the wreck market
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
because we no longer have effective
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
demands and sometimes these wrecks sell
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
for as low as five dollars a wreck
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
whereas in other markets they've ranged
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
of course with market conditions prices
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
fluctuate but it's not unknown from them
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
to be in the hundreds of dollars
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
depriving private persons and entities
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
of the renewable energy attributes of
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
their own renewable generation deprives
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
them of a property right with real world
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
financial value indeed the federal trade
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
commission regulations make it illegal
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
for businesses to market themselves as
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
using renewable energy if they do not
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
keep control of the renewable energy
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
attributes associated with the wreck
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
this is true even when the business uses
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
the physical electricity from that
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
renewable generation to power its own
 
02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.629 align:start position:0%
renewable generation to power its own
operations

02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
if that business sells or otherwise
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
loses ownership by sweeping of its
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes it loses the right
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
to claim it's using renewable energy
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
so this rec sweeping provision actually
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
exposes new hampshire business owners to
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
legal jeopardy
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to depriving them of their
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
property without their knowledge and
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
without compensation
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
in summary
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
by seizing the renewable energy
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
attributes of new hampshire residents
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
and businesses own renewable generation
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
the current version of the statute
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
deprives them of their property rights
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
to their own renewable energy and bars
 
02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
them from legally marketing themselves
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
as renewable energy users a valuable
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
attribute in today's market
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
worse it deprives them of these
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
financially valuable property rights
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
again without their knowledge and
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
without compensation
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is an uncompensated seizure of
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
private property affected by state power
 
02:03:32.070 --> 02:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
under the statute and it's a blatant
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
violation of both our state and
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
the general court should pass h.b 396
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
and abolish this unconstitutional
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
practice of wrecked sweeping
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
in order to protect the property and
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of new hampshire
 
02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:49.189 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of new hampshire
residents

02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
well congratulations representative you
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
did it in five minutes and three seconds
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
congratulations last time was three and
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
a half minutes
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to cut you off because we
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
have no other speakers uh registered to
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm impressed that you did it so
 
02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.589 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm impressed that you did it so
accurately

02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair uh
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative homila is recognized for
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes sure thank you and thank you rex
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham for taking my
 
02:04:20.639 --> 02:04:21.589 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham for taking my
question

02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i understand
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
what you said correctly were you saying
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
that these unused wrecks
 
02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
that these unused wrecks
are

02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
are
available

02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
for sweeping
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
because the individuals did not choose
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
to register these wrecks did i
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly yes indeed so
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
i personally have a solar array on my
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
roof i do not choose to register those
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
wrecks because i have them because i
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
want to keep them as my renewable energy
 
02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:52.629 align:start position:0%
want to keep them as my renewable energy
i

02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
until i got an electric vehicle i was
 
02:04:57.270 --> 02:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
able to meet all of my electrical needs
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
from renewable energy that was something
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
i felt was a worthwhile investment i had
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
since discovered that my renewable
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
energy attributes have been likely swept
 
02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
up by someone else who's been
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
using them for financial gain without my
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge without any compensation and i
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
am by no means alone any person
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
not registering their wrecks who seeks
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
to keep them themselves for their own
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
purposes as is their right they paid the
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
money they invested in the equipment
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's theirs
 
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:36.070 align:start position:0%
it's theirs
yes

02:05:36.070 --> 02:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
the chair following follow up uh the the
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
only other comment i had to that is that
 
02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:42.149 align:start position:0%
only other comment i had to that is that
if

02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
if that's if the system is in place
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
where people have to register them
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
then isn't that when they choose not to
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
isn't that sort of implicit permission
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
that things can be done with them what
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
let's see if i had a cattle ranch and i
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
didn't register my cattle and somebody
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
came took my cattle
 
02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
would not would i be remiss and not
 
02:06:08.709 --> 02:06:08.719 align:start position:0%
having registered them well if there's a
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
program i'm just asking because i again
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
there's no we're not talking about
 
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
cattle registering we're talking about
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
this i'm just curious again i'm just
 
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
trying to understand so i appreciate it
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
but if a part of the program is that you
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
have to register
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
these wrecks in order to not have them
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
swept then people who choose not to do
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
that are
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
in some ways implicitly giving their
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
permission to have them
 
02:06:33.119 --> 02:06:34.950 align:start position:0%
permission to have them
swept

02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
swept
 
02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:35.750 align:start position:0%
swept
i

02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
i i hear your words but i i don't it it
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to me okay thank you so
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
much for your time okay thank you
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative cam grills is recognized
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman and
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative oxenham
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why you wouldn't
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
register your ex i'm trying to
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
understand that why wouldn't all the
 
02:06:58.079 --> 02:06:59.350 align:start position:0%
understand that why wouldn't all the
individuals

02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
the when i
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
again sorry for falling back on my
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
personal experience when i purchased my
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
system i was told that i could register
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
my wrecks if i wanted to participate in
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
the wreck market i had no interest in
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
participating in a wreck market so i did
 
02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
not register my system it
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
this is you know it was a voluntary it's
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
open to you to register if you so wish
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
why would you do so to participate in
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
the wreck market if you don't want to
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
participate in the wreck market no one
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
is there's no one is telling you that
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
you are at risk
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
of losing your property rights to your
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy production
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
there's no government program that's out
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
there telling you there's no private
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
solar developer that's telling you you
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't find out about this it's going on
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
without your knowledge and other people
 
02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:00.870 align:start position:0%
without your knowledge and other people
are

02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
making a financial a substantial
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
financial gain
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
the other part about this is that the
 
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is solely funded
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
by the alternative compliance payments
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments are what
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
the utilities and the electricity
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
generators have to pay if they can't
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
find enough wrecks well guess what
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're not finding any problem finding
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
wrecks because they're sweeping them and
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
not paying for them
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
and as a result our renewable energy
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
fund has been steadily
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
year after year uh diminishing we have
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
fewer dollars available to provide to
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and towns and individuals in
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
any incentive mechanisms because we've
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
allowed our wreck market to be wrecked
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
by this
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:09:01.589 --> 02:09:01.599 align:start position:0%
unauthorized seizure of private property
 
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes mr chairman thank you i i
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
i understand your point what you're
 
02:09:07.679 --> 02:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
i understand your point what you're
saying

02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
my question to you is
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh is there any negative impact to you
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
using yourself as an example is there
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
any negative impact to you
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
for registering your own um your own
 
02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:23.109 align:start position:0%
for registering your own um your own
credits

02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
i know that there's
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
in fact i if i could hand that question
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
off to someone who i know has sold his
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
wrecks and has gone through the process
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
which is uh representative samsich
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
to me it it's it's more of a
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know when i was studying economics i
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
used to teach economics we called it a
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
psychic quasi-rent you have a
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
you you experience a benefit
 
02:09:49.199 --> 02:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
you you experience a benefit
by

02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's like living in new hampshire we
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
we derive psychic quasi rents from the
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
beauty and the wonder of living in new
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire can you put a price tag on
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
that no but you receive a value by
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
living in new hampshire that's what
 
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
renewable energy production is for me
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um we'll allow
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative samsich to share his
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
experiences in the rec program in just a
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
few minutes but first i recognize
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts for a
 
02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:24.870 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts for a
question

02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative i'm having a hard time
 
02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.709 align:start position:0%
representative i'm having a hard time
understanding

02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
i remember this discussion clearly when
 
02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:31.830 align:start position:0%
i remember this discussion clearly when
we

02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
we voted that they could aggregate
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
we call it sleep we'll call it vacuum
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
we'll call it whatever you want the
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
wrecks from people who have not claimed
 
02:10:41.599 --> 02:10:45.189 align:start position:0%
wrecks from people who have not claimed
them

02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
02:10:46.719 --> 02:10:48.069 align:start position:0%
do you know
now

02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
how many
 
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.430 align:start position:0%
how many
wrecks

02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
your system produces
 
02:10:54.239 --> 02:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
your system produces
yes

02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
i have a 6.9 kilowatt system
 
02:10:59.040 --> 02:10:59.910 align:start position:0%
i have a 6.9 kilowatt system
and

02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
because it's facing more
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
west no more south
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's facing more west than it is facing
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
south it doesn't have the world's
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
greatest production so i get i would if
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
i were involved in this market i would
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
be entitled to about five wrecks
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
even though people with smaller systems
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
are entitled to more wrecks but if we
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
ever get time of used pricing
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
my system is going to
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
function better because of that westward
 
02:11:30.639 --> 02:11:31.669 align:start position:0%
function better because of that westward
angle

02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
angle
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
sure go go ahead
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
no i was asking the chair well he said
 
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
no i was asking the chair well he said
yes

02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear
 
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear
um

02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
if you haven't
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
how an intangible thing
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
can become
 
02:11:56.239 --> 02:11:57.990 align:start position:0%
can become
property

02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:11:59.629 --> 02:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
and that's where i come with the
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
if i decided to suck the oxygen out of
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
your yard
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
would you say i was taking your property
 
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.830 align:start position:0%
would you say i was taking your property
i

02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
i wonder
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
how we can say that this intangible
 
02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.430 align:start position:0%
how we can say that this intangible
wreck

02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
wreck
 
02:12:23.830 --> 02:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
and assuming a system
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
or anybody system operates at top
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
top production
 
02:12:30.079 --> 02:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
top production
and

02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.790 align:start position:0%
be considered
property

02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
property
and

02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
if they want if somebody wanted to
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
follow up with that somebody want to
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
sweep you
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
how do they know how much your system
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
produces if
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
at those two points if i could take the
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
last question first uh the utility knows
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
when my system was interconnected to the
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
grid what was coming on so they know
 
02:13:00.159 --> 02:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
grid what was coming on so they know
um

02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
as far as the value
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
we put a value on reputation people can
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
sue for millions of dollars if harmed to
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
their reputation that's an intangible
 
02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
their reputation that's an intangible
um

02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are many other things in the
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
business world you know copyrights for
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
songs i mean there are many things that
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
are intangible but you know somebody's
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
taken your creative endeavor
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
um in my case yo i invested real money
 
02:13:25.599 --> 02:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
um in my case yo i invested real money
in

02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
in that system it produces value for me
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
and for somebody to be taking that value
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
and wrecking our
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
market-based system which provides the
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
funding the only funding for our
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's outrageous and i have a
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer's i have a legal opinion here
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
that it's also unconstitutional
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
and as representatives of the state i
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
think once informed as we now are
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
that there is a unconstitutional
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
provision in our statutes it is our duty
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh before i recognize other
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
people for questions and there are quite
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
a few people here who still have
 
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:15.990 align:start position:0%
a few people here who still have
questions

02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
i want to inform the committee that
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
karen crampton
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
who manages the rps program
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
here in the state
 
02:14:25.119 --> 02:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
here in the state
is

02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
online and i have
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
permitted her to speak
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it might be useful at this point if
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
miss cranston could
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh address a couple of issues
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
to help people as they form
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
how many wrecks are we talking about
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
get swept
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
if representative oxygen has five unused
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
wrecks approximately what would they be
 
02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:58.229 align:start position:0%
wrecks approximately what would they be
worth

02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
worth
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
if the rec price was twenty eight
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
dollars would be worth 140
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh but miss crampton if you could just
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
give us a quick
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
maybe two minute overview of the wreck
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
sweeping situation
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
and give us some statistics about it
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
that would be very helpful as we
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
ask additional questions on this issue
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
so go ahead ms crampton and thank you
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
hi good morning um
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
members of this uh st e committee um
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
i guess thank you for your questions
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative or chairman vos i will
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
try to i guess start with just a quick
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
overview of how
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
this um policy mechanism is implemented
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
so what happens on an annual basis
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
and um this is a calendar year annual
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
basis so we're actually going through
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
this process right now
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
is that the commission
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh sends a request to the utilities
 
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
to let us know all
 
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
systems that are net metered and this is
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
both class one and class two so class
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
one is new renewables although i will
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
tell you if that's a very small
 
02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
tell you if that's a very small
percentage

02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:13.750 align:start position:0%
percentage
um

02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
and then class two is our solar we send
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
a request to the utilities to understand
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
and get information on all of these
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
systems that are interconnected and net
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
metering in new hampshire
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
we then also
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
because we do this part the commission
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
does this part we know all of the
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
systems that are
 
02:16:37.750 --> 02:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
registered for renewable energy
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
certificates or wreck what we call rec
 
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.429 align:start position:0%
certificates or wreck what we call rec
eligible

02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
and what we do is we go through a
 
02:16:43.359 --> 02:16:44.629 align:start position:0%
and what we do is we go through a
comparison

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
of to determine which systems
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
are interconnected
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
and not
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
registered for
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh wrecks
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
once we have that that then subset
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
of wrecks well systems that are not rec
 
02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.309 align:start position:0%
of wrecks well systems that are not rec
eligible

02:17:04.309 --> 02:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
add up some the capacity for those
 
02:17:11.679 --> 02:17:13.270 align:start position:0%
add up some the capacity for those
systems

02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
and then we apply the capacity factor um
 
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
currently in statute that's 20 percent
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we apply that to estimate the
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
generation out of those systems and
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
you'll probably all remember monday
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
there was a public hearing on
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
changing that capacity factor from 20
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh down to the
 
02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:34.870 align:start position:0%
uh down to the
uh

02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
capacity factor that's determined by iso
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
new england
 
02:17:38.479 --> 02:17:39.190 align:start position:0%
new england
so

02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
we go through an estimation calculation
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
so we again we take that subset of
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
systems that are not registered
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
or eligible to generate rex
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
we apply the 20 capacity factor
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
that gives us an estimated generation
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
for the year
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
we then can divide that generation
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
estimated generation which is in
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours for example you divide it
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
by a thousand and you get your megawatt
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
um equivalent megawatt hour equivalent
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
each megawatt hour as we know is is
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
equivalent to one rack
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
so it's the commission that's doing that
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
wreck estimation so out of that
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
calculation we determine there's
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
x number of um
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
class two wrecks
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
that would have been available
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
had those systems gone through the
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
certification process
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
then what happens is we convert that
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
into a credit
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
and that credit is
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
posted to the commission's website
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
and all electricity suppliers are able
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
to take that credit
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
against their rps compliance for class
 
02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:46.870 align:start position:0%
against their rps compliance for class
two

02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
so in past years for example
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you um
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
give me one second
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
in 20
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
oops sorry
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh 2019 uh 2020 which is the most recent
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
um year that we've done this for
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh the class two
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
requirement is 0.7
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
for compliance
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the credit that is given against
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
that compliance mechanism is
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry
 
02:19:30.319 --> 02:19:31.750 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry
uh

02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
here we go it's on a different web page
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
the compliance that was determined or
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
the credit that was determined out of
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
that was point
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
four seven nine four
 
02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.469 align:start position:0%
four seven nine four
so

02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
what what all of the suppliers are
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to do is when they file their
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
compliance reports with the commission
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
by july 1st
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
they can take that 0.7 percent
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
class 2 requirement
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they can subtract
 
02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
and they can subtract
0.4794

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
now you all know i've never been good at
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
math on the fly
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
but i think that's approximately their
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
new obligation for class 2 would be
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that yeah so i mean i'm explaining to
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
you how it works the same exact thing
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
happens on class one
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
but you will see that the compliance uh
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
or the credit that's given against the
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
class one obligation is point zero zero
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
five four percent out of uh
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
oh golly um let me go back
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
out of a compliance requirement of
 
02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:56.030 align:start position:0%
out of a compliance requirement of
uh

02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
8.9 so it's a it's a
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a very small portion of it
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
class two as representative oxenham um
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
noted is a very large percent of the
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
overall obligation
 
02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
overall obligation
so

02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
i won't take any more of your time i'll
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
just stop talking but i hope that
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
provided at least an education on how
 
02:21:19.910 --> 02:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
we implement the policy
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that you stand by in
 
02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:24.550 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that you stand by in
case

02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have other questions that you could
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh shed some light on i now recognize
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think my question was answered
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative rezny's question was
 
02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.030 align:start position:0%
okay representative rezny's question was
answered

02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
answered
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh one of my questions i think you said
 
02:21:58.469 --> 02:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that uh
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsich is gonna talk
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
later so i think he's gonna answer that
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
question but the other question i have
 
02:22:09.359 --> 02:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
question but the other question i have
is

02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:12.469 align:start position:0%
is
if

02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:22:15.190 --> 02:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
if the electric company is sweeping
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
these reps
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
do they know who they're sweeping them
 
02:22:20.399 --> 02:22:26.389 align:start position:0%
do they know who they're sweeping them
from

02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:26.399 --> 02:22:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to answer that or should we
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
ask no they don't as ms
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
crampton said it's a
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's a total times a factor it's
 
02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:39.349 align:start position:0%
it's a total times a factor it's
anonymous

02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
anonymous
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're just dealing with kilowatt hours
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours not individuals and names
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
or companies
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's absolutely correct it
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
is all an estimation we we take the
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
total capacity of just everybody is one
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
group we apply the capacity factor we
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
are estimating the generation
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
and and yes as you said it's all in that
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
unanimous or it's all anonymous man i'm
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
anonymous thank you
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
and um yes that's how it works
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:13.270 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
uh

02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
my question representative um
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
i admit you you raised an interesting
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
argument i was curious if you were aware
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
of or have you attempted to
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
actually take any legal action or are
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
aware of any particular court cases that
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
other people may have tried uh to bring
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
this to attention reports are you aware
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
of any legal action whatsoever anywhere
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
involving this subject
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
this is a question to me
 
02:23:50.309 --> 02:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much um this this
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism only exists in new hampshire
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
and it has existed i
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure mrs crampton can tell us how
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
long it's been existence but it hasn't
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's to my understanding it's something
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's fairly recent i think it's in the
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
last certainly in the last decade
 
02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:08.230 align:start position:0%
last certainly in the last decade
um

02:24:08.230 --> 02:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think most people are unaware of the
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
actuality of it i mean if the ftc was to
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
come in and sue someone for claiming
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
that they produced their product with
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and they're green and
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're a good
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
neighbor and people should buy their
 
02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:27.270 align:start position:0%
neighbor and people should buy their
product

02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's then then we'd know about it then
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
someone could um you know
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
raise it as a court action but at this
 
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
point it's in statute and because it's
 
02:24:40.230 --> 02:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
in statute it's legal for them to do it
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't have any grounds
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
to stand on you'd say well you know
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
ignorance is no excuse you're supposed
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
to know the laws of your state and if
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
you weren't aware of it
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're out of luck so i i think anyone
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
who turned to a lawyer would be told
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:02.710 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman and thank you

representative oxenham
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
if the issue seems to be notification so
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
that people are aware
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know when i
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't assume who brought this
 
02:25:26.230 --> 02:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
statute forward but those who
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
created this mechanism
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
again i'm i'm this is supposition i i
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
don't think they wanted people to know i
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
think this works very well to their
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
advantage without people being aware of
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
so why require people to know about it
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
then somebody
 
02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
might actually try to change the statute
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
so it is illegal to deprive people of
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
their private property in which they've
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
invested their money
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
to meet somebody else's legal
 
02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
to meet somebody else's legal
obligations

02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chair can i have a follow-up
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow up yes yes ma'am
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
um then why not propose a bill that
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
because i do not want the renewable
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
energy fund to be depleted i don't want
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
our wreck market to be ruined i when
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
people invest their money we'll hear a
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
lot about this when we get to hb213
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
people invest in renewable energy under
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
the assumption that they're going to be
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
gain back
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
over time
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
the benefits so you know the payback
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
period is usually about seven years for
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
investment in the solar array
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
but they also are told by the individual
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
or the company that they're buying it
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
from that hey you know there's a wreck
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
market and you can also
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
create an income stream from the wreck
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
market and that's part of how businesses
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
and towns municipalities make their
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
determination to go forward with the
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy investment because they
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
are told they will be able to gain a an
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
income stream every single year every
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour you produce there's
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility of a
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
money back to you
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
well with a wrecked market
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't have an income
 
02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:26.870 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't have an income
stream

02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mick
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
williams i notice you have your physical
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
hand raised
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
um and i am going to call on you but can
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
i suggest that in the future you use
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
that raised hand function of zoom
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
because raising your physical hand is
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh haphazard as a way to gain attention
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
but i do recognize you now for a
 
02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair bose i do not
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
have a raise my hand function on my zoom
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
i actually logged out and logged back in
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
because i thought it was a bug but for
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
some reason i don't see it here on my
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
screen i can't raise my hand so thank
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
you for calling on me for the physical
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
hand this is trying to get around a
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
technical issue
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
question can i just ask you did you look
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
at the participants panel
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
did i look at the participants panel um
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
the link that i used was emailed to me
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
from my legislative email it said one
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
hour warning
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
science and technology will begin in one
 
02:28:26.550 --> 02:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
hour on that's the link i clicked on but
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
straight at the bottom there's a little
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
on my screen anyway
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
if you move your cursor down to the
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
middle different systems operate
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
differently and
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
i see
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
had a difficulty previously
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
i just did this because i don't have a
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
raised hand and i'm sorry if i did i
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
would raise my hand yep
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay well if you can't find it
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
we'll i'll try to recognize you i'll try
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
to look at you more often i would hate
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
to interrupt but sometimes it's under
 
02:29:00.389 --> 02:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
reactions as well go down to the bottom
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
of the screen
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
i have reactions on my screen okay i'm
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
sorry then i'm sorry
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
i use zoom all the time i i promise you
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not missing something this is a
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
technical issue
 
02:29:13.190 --> 02:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay so my question here is um i think
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
this is for uh miss crampton actually
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to know is
 
02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:20.469 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to know is
um

02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
is there compensation
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
is there some kind of compensation
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the utilities using these wrecks
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason i'm asking this is
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me like this is
 
02:29:34.240 --> 02:29:35.349 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me like this is
money

02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
the wrecks equal money that belonged to
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
whoever installed a solar system on
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
their home and they did not register the
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
wrecks but there's still some money
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
floating around which sounds like
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
which technically would go to the state
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
rather than to a utility as a bonus so i
 
02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
just want to get a sense of what is the
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
compensation for these wrecks if there
 
02:30:02.309 --> 02:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
if i if i may chairman votes would you
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
like me to address that that question
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
was directed at you ms crampton okay
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for the question
 
02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:13.990 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for the question
representative

02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.469 align:start position:0%
there is no
money

02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
going back and forth for that credit so
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
again it's a computational
 
02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:27.030 align:start position:0%
again it's a computational
mathematical

02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
mathematical
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
function that happens at the commission
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
so we're estimating that generation
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
converting that estimated generation
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
into and in a way theoretical racks
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we're applying
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
a calculated percentage
 
02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:44.630 align:start position:0%
a calculated percentage
against

02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
the overall compliance requirement so
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
we're taking that point seven percent
 
02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
and we're saying
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
it your obligation is 0.7
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
but when you file your report you can
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
from that output from your obligation
 
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
and your new obligation is
 
02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:09.349 align:start position:0%
and your new obligation is
0.22

02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
0.22
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
dot dot
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
so then what they do is they take that
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
new percentage against the
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
and again those percent
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
obligations are computed against then
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
the suppliers total sales
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
right so instead of saying i sold a
 
02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:27.270 align:start position:0%
right so instead of saying i sold a
thousand

02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours to all my customers and i
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
my rps obligation is a thousand times
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
point seven percent
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
what they can do instead is say i sold a
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
thousand kilowatt hours
 
02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
thousand kilowatt hours
my

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
obligation or requirement to the rps is
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
a thousand times point
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
two two and i probably should do the
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
math so i can give you the right number
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the way it works so
 
02:31:51.359 --> 02:31:52.230 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the way it works so
it's

02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
it is just a reduction in the compliance
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
requirement there is no actual purchase
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
or selling of wrecks
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
because these aren't wrecks
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
but if they didn't meet their
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
requirement they would have to pay real
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
money in
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
in an alternative compliance payment
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
would they not miss crampton
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct so if the obligation if
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
their obligation
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
either way with whatever your obligation
 
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:21.429 align:start position:0%
either way with whatever your obligation
is

02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:32:24.070 --> 02:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
if you cannot purchase rex on the open
 
02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:25.270 align:start position:0%
if you cannot purchase rex on the open
market

02:32:25.270 --> 02:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
then you do
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
cut you you you balance out you meet
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
your compliance by making alternative
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
compliance payments so yes your
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
compliance obligation is met through a
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
combination of two things a wreck
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
and your alternative compliance payment
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
so yes this and this is reducing that
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
overall compliance so you would in
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
theory purchase less racks or make less
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
acp payments
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
can i follow up on this yes um
 
02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
so i understand what you're saying in
 
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
terms of there being a penalty for the
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
utility not meeting this requirement
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
can you give me a dollar value as to
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
what that penalty would be if we were
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very difficult to do because
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
it is a market so it's all based on
 
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
supply and demand um what i can tell you
 
02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:25.030 align:start position:0%
supply and demand um what i can tell you
is

02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:28.469 --> 02:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
the alternative compliant payment rate
 
02:33:28.479 --> 02:33:29.469 align:start position:0%
the alternative compliant payment rate
for

02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:29.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
2020 i think i got you right was 57. and
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
61 cents
 
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.910 align:start position:0%
61 cents
so

02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
this comes down now to it's a market so
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's all about supply and demand
 
02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
it's all about supply and demand
so

02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
they would either meet that compliance
 
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
through rex at
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
57.61 i'm sorry acp's at 57.61
 
02:33:53.670 --> 02:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
or by purchasing rex which we generally
 
02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:54.950 align:start position:0%
or by purchasing rex which we generally
say

02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
the acp is setting the ceiling price so
 
02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
but you're right that point forward
 
02:34:05.590 --> 02:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
because i believe this money should go
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
fundamentally i think that there's a
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
cash value that's being left out that
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
the state should receive compensation
 
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to find out what the
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
dollar value is
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i because nothing's actually being
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
transacted i guess that's where i'm
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
having difficulty
 
02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:21.990 align:start position:0%
having difficulty
um

02:34:21.990 --> 02:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
miss crampton if you're looking at the
 
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
2020 figures
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
i believe in your latest report there's
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
a graph that shows what the payments
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
were for the last decade
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
if you were just to take say 2014
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
and tell us how much money
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
came into the renewable energy fund in
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
that year
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
i mean we're talking millions of dollars
 
02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:47.750 align:start position:0%
i mean we're talking millions of dollars
here

02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
this is this is the all the all these
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
little point percentage oh
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
this is real money which matters to
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
real people
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
nice try representative oxenam but 2014
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
was a particularly high acp year in
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
subsequent years it's been much much
 
02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
subsequent years it's been much much
lower

02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
lower
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
because of the wrecked red market where
 
02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:17.590 align:start position:0%
because of the wrecked red market where
you

02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that if the utilities are
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
obligated to buy fewer wrecks because
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
they've swept up some of these existing
 
02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:25.670 align:start position:0%
they've swept up some of these existing
wrecks

02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
that their costs are lower and therefore
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
nice try i'm a rate payer who's been
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
been scammed and i'm not i'm not getting
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
a benefit i'll tell you that question
 
02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
was for miss crampton
 
02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:48.469 align:start position:0%
was for miss crampton
um

02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
it is again because we are
 
02:35:51.439 --> 02:35:52.790 align:start position:0%
it is again because we are
calculating

02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
calculating
 
02:35:55.510 --> 02:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
a percentage
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
based on estimated generation and again
 
02:36:00.230 --> 02:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
they are these aren't these aren't
 
02:36:02.469 --> 02:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
wrecks we are literally taking that
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
calculation and subtracting it from the
 
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
overall obligation so we're reducing the
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
rps obligation
 
02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:10.389 align:start position:0%
rps obligation
um

02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
which does mean
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
utilities and suppliers have to purchase
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
fewer wrecks or make fewer alternative
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
which ultimately lowers the cost of rate
 
02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:25.830 align:start position:0%
which ultimately lowers the cost of rate
payers

02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
payers
 
02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:26.790 align:start position:0%
payers
so

02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative resny is recognized for a
 
02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman you asked
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
the exact question i had
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't mean to stand here for
 
02:36:38.790 --> 02:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
thunder i'd like to hear
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative sausage's experience with
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
the rack market
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
um it was alluded to earlier
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative samsich that you've had
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of experience with the wreck
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
market could you share that with us
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you mr chairman and uh
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh ms krampton also for being
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
here um
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes i i had uh solar collectors
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
installed five years ago and
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
approximately the same size as represent
 
02:37:10.319 --> 02:37:12.389 align:start position:0%
approximately the same size as represent
oxenham

02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
oxenham
 
02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
and when i inquired at the time of my
 
02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
installer about this idea of getting
 
02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:18.870 align:start position:0%
installer about this idea of getting
wrecks

02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
i was told that
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
it was a very complicated system to sign
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
up for and therefore
 
02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
for ordinary so uh solar collectors on
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
residential roofs it was not worth the
 
02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:32.790 align:start position:0%
residential roofs it was not worth the
effort

02:37:32.790 --> 02:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
and so i kind of ignored that hearing
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
that advice
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
but then a couple years ago when i was
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and i heard about
 
02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
this i looked into it
 
02:37:46.150 --> 02:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that the the main issue
 
02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
is uh registering your your facility as
 
02:37:51.270 --> 02:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
an energy generator
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
and being able to uh confirm how much
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
energy you're generating
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
and how much and therefore allowing
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
those wrecks to be sold into the wreck
 
02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
those wrecks to be sold into the wreck
market

02:38:03.270 --> 02:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i found out that it was not that
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
difficult uh once i registered with the
 
02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:10.469 align:start position:0%
difficult uh once i registered with the
puc

02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
puc
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
which was a little bureaucratic but not
 
02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
very um
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
all i then had to sign up with a auditor
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
who could confirm
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh the generation that i was having
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
and either i put a electronic monitoring
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
device on my system at a cost of maybe
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars a unit
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh or i sign up with an auditor
 
02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:36.070 align:start position:0%
uh or i sign up with an auditor
uh

02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:38:38.550 --> 02:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
for ten dollars a year
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm required every month to report
 
02:38:44.389 --> 02:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
to him how much what what the reading on
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
my production is so he can record that
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then that auditor
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
would would be a aggregator
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
that passed on my rex
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
to the the a company that would be in
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
the auction market to sell those wrecks
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i've been doing that now for a year
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it's working pretty well and so
 
02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
like i said i paid ten dollars a year
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
for the auditor
 
02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
for the auditor
um

02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
i i don't pay anything else but that and
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh i only generate about six
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour wrecks a year
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh and i've i've
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
received payments uh between
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
22 and 38 dollars per wreck over the
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
past year so maybe 130 a year
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
but to do that i just paid the auditor
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
10 a year and i report every month my my
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
recorded numbers
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
now uh so it is a little convoluted and
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
i did it because i heard about the wreck
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
sweeping and i felt uh unlike a
 
02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham who wants to have
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
wrecks and wants to keep them for her
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
personal gratification
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
i felt one way of combating the wreck
 
02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
sweeping was to register and stop people
 
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
from sweeping my wrecks
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm a little bit shocked to hear
 
02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:07.270 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm a little bit shocked to hear
from

02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
miss crampton that something like 68
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the requirements
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
for class one wrecks
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the utilities is being met by
 
02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:19.190 align:start position:0%
for the utilities is being met by
credits

02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
from people who
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
don't register
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
and are being used by the utilities as a
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
substitute of course that will drive
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
down uh somewhat electric uh rates
 
02:40:35.270 --> 02:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
however it's stealing those wrecks from
 
02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:36.230 align:start position:0%
however it's stealing those wrecks from
people

02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
and using and having the utilities not
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
have to pay for those wrecks that
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're obligated to do so i encourage
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
everybody actually to sign up uh and
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
register if they're generating renewable
 
02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:49.110 align:start position:0%
register if they're generating renewable
energy

02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
so that was my experience
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing that experience
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
with us uh representative samsuch
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative murray i i see that you
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
would like to ask a question so please
 
02:41:03.590 --> 02:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you very much yeah just
 
02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
as a newbie here and trying to follow
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
all this can i just get confirmation and
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm very close to having that with um
 
02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative sumsitch's remarks but
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
the crux of the matter here aside from
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
all these numbers which really don't
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
matter you know they really don't
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
resonate with me the utility takes up
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
these swept wrecks so they sweep up
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
these wrecks for their own financial
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
benefit without paying for them in any
 
02:41:29.910 --> 02:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
way and they can do this because of the
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
way this law is written is that
 
02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
basically the issue that we're talking
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
about here that you get utilities are
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of unregistered wrecks
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
for their financial benefit
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
with no financial
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
cost to themselves am i on the right
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
track here
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes not not only at no cost to
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
themselves but at a substantial
 
02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
financial benefit to themselves
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:58.150 --> 02:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative bresni is recognized
 
02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this question is
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
for karen crompton um
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
at what point do rex come into existence
 
02:42:08.309 --> 02:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
in in the case where uh an individual
 
02:42:11.190 --> 02:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
generates their electricity
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
mrs crampton
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
uh

02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
very similar to what representative
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
sanchez samsich was um indicating is
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
that your solar for example is is
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
generating electricity um on an hourly
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
minutely basis
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis you report uh that
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
generation to an independent monitor
 
02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:37.429 align:start position:0%
generation to an independent monitor
and

02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:39.510 --> 02:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
on a quarterly basis
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
kneepool gis which is the new england
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
power pool
 
02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:44.950 align:start position:0%
power pool
they

02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:46.870 align:start position:0%
they
administer

02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
administer
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
the wreck market they what they call
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
mint that generation
 
02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
into wrecks so it happens quarterly
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
um for every 1 000 kilowatt hours that
 
02:43:01.270 --> 02:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
are generated that have been
 
02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
certified in the sense by an independent
 
02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:05.030 align:start position:0%
certified in the sense by an independent
monitor

02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
those kilowatt hours are then minted
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
into a wreck
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
each wreck gets a a unique identifier
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then those racks are traded uh on
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
the g
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that uh my follow
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
question is if if you don't register and
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
you don't report the amount you're
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
generating then when do the wrecks come
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you i guess
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
they're not ever a part of gis if you're
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
not reporting that
 
02:43:50.399 --> 02:43:51.990 align:start position:0%
not reporting that
production

02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
production
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
up through gis they don't ever
 
02:43:56.710 --> 02:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
they're not minted
 
02:43:56.720 --> 02:43:58.550 align:start position:0%
they're not minted
um

02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
you're welcome my follow-up question to
 
02:44:03.990 --> 02:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
that miss crampton would be well if the
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
wrecks are never really created then how
 
02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:13.439 --> 02:44:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i again we're we're create weird as
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:44:21.670 --> 02:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
at the commission calculating
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
a credit against the obligation um i i
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
think it's a policy discussion on
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
whether you consider those wrecks or not
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
wrecks that estimated generation that
 
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're creating and how so i
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
i will i guess leave my comment at that
 
02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
my response
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative partial is
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
yes i do understand how when you are
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
estimating the cost of
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
of these undeclared energy i don't care
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you call it rex or not it seems like
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of semantics but you are
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
getting your credit by paying your
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
numbers you're saving
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
your your utility money now a statement
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
was made earlier that this money is
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
being passed on to ratepayers
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
do you have any evidence that that money
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
actually goes to ratepayers and not to
 
02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:13.429 align:start position:0%
actually goes to ratepayers and not to
shareholders

02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that was for karen crampton okay
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of the right
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
um as part of the
 
02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:26.830 align:start position:0%
um as part of the
pucs

02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
pucs
 
02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
we do make sure
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
and and this is done through the
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
electric division so i'm probably not
 
02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
going to use all the right words and i
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
but this the cost of compliance with the
 
02:45:42.399 --> 02:45:43.830 align:start position:0%
but this the cost of compliance with the
rps

02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
rps
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
is a cost that is allowable
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
to be recovered uh through electric
 
02:45:49.439 --> 02:45:50.710 align:start position:0%
to be recovered uh through electric
rates

02:45:50.710 --> 02:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:51.510 align:start position:0%
rates
um

02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it is the electric division that
 
02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
does take a look at that and make sure
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the utilities at least the
 
02:45:59.590 --> 02:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities
 
02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:00.630 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities
are

02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
meeting that obligation in the most
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
cost-effective way possible
 
02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
which generally means you know that
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing the wrecks uh over
 
02:46:11.269 --> 02:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
acps provided they're available and
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
those the cost of compliance is part of
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
rates and you'll see that when we
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
present to you those pie charts of
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know what what is in the energy cost
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see a little sliver that is rps
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that that is that rps sliver
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
is or slice of the pie
 
02:46:32.309 --> 02:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
is the cost of rps compliance so it is
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
the rate payers that are paying for that
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you mr
 
02:46:50.790 --> 02:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
crampton for taking my question
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh just to be clear
 
02:46:56.950 --> 02:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
02:46:58.800 --> 02:46:59.510 align:start position:0%
to be clear
the

02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:02.550 --> 02:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
wrecks that the wrecks that are swept up
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
are used by the utilities
 
02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:06.710 align:start position:0%
are used by the utilities
that

02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
lowers their
 
02:47:12.630 --> 02:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
acp activities their their alternate
 
02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:13.830 align:start position:0%
acp activities their their alternate
payments

02:47:13.830 --> 02:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
payments
 
02:47:15.830 --> 02:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
the often compliance statements which in
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
effect when it comes to rate time
 
02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:20.469 align:start position:0%
effect when it comes to rate time
effectively

02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
lower the rates for the for all of the
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
people within the the utilities
 
02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh area which in in essence
 
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
benefits all of the ratepayers
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
in their area in much the same way as
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
when people use solar power
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
that the solar power by a few
 
02:47:42.389 --> 02:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
benefits everybody in the state even
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
though people do pay a small percentage
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
from your electric bill even though they
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't have solar power on
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
their house
 
02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
is the type of
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
benefits can be looked at both ways it
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think that was for you miss crampton
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
i i guess i would say that um
 
02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
in that the credit reduces the overall
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
compliance requirement
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes it's reducing the overall
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
cost but again remember that it's it's
 
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's racks and acps so it's
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's not that they're saving alternative
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
compliance payments necessarily they
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
could have also purchased wrecks to meet
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
that compliance but yeah you're all you
 
02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
are reducing the overall requirement
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
as part of this
 
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
i i think they answered your question
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
but if not
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
please ask
 
02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:46.070 align:start position:0%
please ask
again

02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:48:48.150 --> 02:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative mcgee
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
um i have a couple i have two questions
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
the first is does the reps wreck
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
sweeping depressed the wreck market in
 
02:49:01.990 --> 02:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
terms of the cost per wreck
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
because i know we have a very low cost
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
per rec and that affects all of the
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
other uh math
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
so uh that's question one
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
um and i think if
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
if miss crampton if you could
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
ask uh if you could answer that one i
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
can put the other question to uh
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
the market is a supply and demand market
 
02:49:31.510 --> 02:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
so you could in just basic economic
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
terms say that if
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
the obligation is reduced there's lower
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
demand and generally when there's lower
 
02:49:40.389 --> 02:49:40.399 align:start position:0%
demand that does
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
depreciate the price or make the price
 
02:49:44.070 --> 02:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
of iraq less
 
02:49:45.110 --> 02:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
then that's
 
02:49:46.630 --> 02:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
market principles
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh i was making that assumption but i'm
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
glad you clarified it for me and then
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
the other question is for representative
 
02:49:53.359 --> 02:49:54.389 align:start position:0%
the other question is for representative
oxenom

02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
oxenom
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
um we've talked a lot about you know the
 
02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh the obligation of the person who's
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
doing the job generating and
 
02:50:05.269 --> 02:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
creating the value and having to
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
you know step forward maybe say i want
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
credit for these wrecks formally so that
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
they can't be swept from me that's one
 
02:50:12.550 --> 02:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
way to solve it but i wonder if you
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
could speak to how
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
hb 396 actually addresses the issue so
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we understand what we're voting for
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the change to the statute if
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
you could just tell us how you propose
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
and unmute
 
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes and done mute well while i try to
 
02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
locate uh my text of the bill which was
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
i believe i have it here
 
02:50:43.590 --> 02:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
nope that's 172. got too many bills all
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:46.710 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's over here
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:48.389 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's over here
[Music]

02:50:48.389 --> 02:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
basically it eliminates the provision
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
that allows rex sweeping if i may be uh
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's 213 which is about to come up
 
02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:02.309 align:start position:0%
that's 213 which is about to come up
um

02:51:02.309 --> 02:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.230 --> 02:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
do you happen to have the bill in front
 
02:51:06.950 --> 02:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
of you i do i do and that's what i see
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
is that it's not added language except
 
02:51:10.469 --> 02:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
for at the very end where it says the
 
02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
total yearly production for such
 
02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:13.269 align:start position:0%
total yearly production for such
customer

02:51:13.269 --> 02:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:51:16.230 --> 02:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
cited sources the rest is all deletions
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the part of the statute that says
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
that wreck sweeping kind of can occur so
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
so that's what the bill does right it
 
02:51:26.630 --> 02:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
makes us like every other state in the
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
united states of america
 
02:51:31.349 --> 02:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
this provision
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
is unique to new hampshire
 
02:51:35.349 --> 02:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
and it has
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
damaged our wreck market it has damaged
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
our ability to finance renewable energy
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the state it damages our ability to
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
deal with things like the climate crisis
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
we need to remove it from statute so
 
02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
that like other states we have a
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
functioning market where supply and
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
demand rules and where corporations that
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
have requirements have to meet them on
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
on on the terms of which the legislation
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
was originally drafted
 
02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i do apologize i don't have that
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
we did
 
02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
it seemed as i recall in the drafting of
 
02:52:16.230 --> 02:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
this we made sure
 
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
that a problem that the puc had
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
previously had was addressed i i know ms
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
crampton had told us that when she goes
 
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the executive council and tries to
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
explain the value of her programs she
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the numbers available to
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
her because of those of us who don't
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
register and so
 
02:52:37.670 --> 02:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
i there is there is a provision there
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
that meets that issue so that that she
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
will be able to
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
have that number available when she does
 
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
go to the executive council
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so there are there are
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
multiple problems that could be
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
addressed but this bill is attempting to
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
address the intent of the original
 
02:52:58.309 --> 02:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
language of the rps
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you are either creating value in
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
the system or you are paying for the
 
02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:03.110 align:start position:0%
the system or you are paying for the
value

02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:53:05.990 --> 02:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you are um
 
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know that you're responsible for if
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
in in
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
um in the case of the utilities
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
very well put thank you
 
02:53:17.269 --> 02:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next step is representative

thank you uh next step is representative
pimentel

02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman this is a
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to get my handle on
 
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
besides the what this does to the
 
02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:37.750 align:start position:0%
besides the what this does to the
average

02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
person who might have solar panels on
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
their house
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
wanting to produce electricity
 
02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:51.349 align:start position:0%
wanting to produce electricity
commercially

02:53:51.349 --> 02:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
on a large scale
 
02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:55.510 align:start position:0%
on a large scale
and

02:53:55.510 --> 02:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
i had the option of
 
02:53:58.240 --> 02:53:59.670 align:start position:0%
i had the option of
installing

02:53:59.670 --> 02:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
installing
 
02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:01.750 align:start position:0%
installing
having

02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
that system installed in new hampshire
 
02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
that system installed in new hampshire
or

02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:09.030 align:start position:0%
or
massachusetts

02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
would there be
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
an incentive for them
 
02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:14.389 align:start position:0%
an incentive for them
choosing

02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
choosing
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts over new hampshire
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
because of the wrecked
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
market we have a regional um wreck
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
market so um i believe that at one time
 
02:54:27.110 --> 02:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative sampson actually sold his
 
02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
renewal his wrecks in connecticut so i i
 
02:54:34.389 --> 02:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
i it's my understanding um and you know
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that that would
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
not enter into the decision as to where
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
you would locate your system
 
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:51.910 --> 02:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
next step is representative rezny thank
 
02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman my question is for
 
02:54:55.920 --> 02:54:57.590 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman my question is for
representative

02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you do not take the steps to cause
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
the wrecks to be created how can the
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
non-existent rex be considered your
 
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:08.550 align:start position:0%
non-existent rex be considered your
property

02:55:08.550 --> 02:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.710 --> 02:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
according to
 
02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not a trained lawyer
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
i think that there is an issue here
 
02:55:34.630 --> 02:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
as to
 
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
the severability of property rights
 
02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:38.790 align:start position:0%
the severability of property rights
um

02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
in my case i have a renewable energy
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
facility and i use renewable energy
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative samsung has a renewable
 
02:55:51.030 --> 02:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
energy facility but he does not utilize
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
he has lost his property right to it
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
because he sold it he he yes he took
 
02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
affirmative steps to make it possible to
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
sell it but the two systems are
 
02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
he he you know invested the money in
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
that meter and monitoring and pays for
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
someone to to take care of it
 
02:56:19.349 --> 02:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
but but he sold it
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
my store down the road which has a
 
02:56:24.630 --> 02:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
renewable panels on on on its roof
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't realize that they have been
 
02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
swept that they can't claim those and
 
02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
they could actually legally be sued in
 
02:56:37.269 --> 02:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:40.389 --> 02:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
because their attributes
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
are they no longer are there they've
 
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate your speculation
 
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative claudia is recognizing
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:58.870 --> 02:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is to ms crampton
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%

02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes i believe she's still here go ahead
 
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes miss crampton uh if i have a system
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
and it's not connected
 
02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if she heard me
 
02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:57:21.200 --> 02:57:22.870 align:start position:0%
go ahead
question

02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
so if i had a system
 
02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:25.590 align:start position:0%
so if i had a system
um

02:57:25.590 --> 02:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:27.030 --> 02:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
miss crampton
 
02:57:30.469 --> 02:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
how many wrecks
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
if you did
 
02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:34.309 align:start position:0%
if you did
yeah

02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:57:36.230 --> 02:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
if you're not connected you're off the
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
grid there's you're not producing wrecks
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me mr chair
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
um yes this was to
 
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
ms crampton
 
02:57:49.429 --> 02:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
she's not here oh
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
okay oh sorry she still is here still
 
02:57:52.399 --> 02:57:55.750 align:start position:0%
okay oh sorry she still is here still
here

02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
i i mean
 
02:57:59.429 --> 02:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
representative claudia
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:58:04.950 --> 02:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh miss crampton
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
if i have a system that's not connected
 
02:58:15.429 --> 02:58:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:15.439 --> 02:58:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:58:16.550 --> 02:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
when we say connected i guess we we have
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
to understand a little bit of what that
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
what that means but assuming you have a
 
02:58:24.790 --> 02:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
system and it's it is producing
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
for every every megawatt hour that that
 
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
system generates you could be creating
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
one renewable energy certificate
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
the way to get that renewable energy
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
certificate though is by registering
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
your system with the public utilities
 
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
commission and participating in the
 
02:58:49.750 --> 02:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
kneepool gis market
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
is that answering your question
 
02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:53.750 align:start position:0%
is that answering your question
um

02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you but i might have used the
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
terminology my system is not registered
 
02:58:59.359 --> 02:59:00.389 align:start position:0%
terminology my system is not registered
so

02:59:00.389 --> 02:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
what is what is uh the rex i would be
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for if it's not registered
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if you if your system is not
 
02:59:07.920 --> 02:59:09.349 align:start position:0%
so if you if your system is not
registered

02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
registered
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
personally in value of something i could
 
02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:13.030 align:start position:0%
personally in value of something i could
sell

02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
right so if your system is not
 
02:59:14.479 --> 02:59:16.150 align:start position:0%
right so if your system is not
registered

02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
registered
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
again you're still you're you're
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
producing that renewable energy and what
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the commission is doing is the
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
commission is estimating what we think
 
02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
your generation is and applying a credit
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
against the overall obligation for that
 
02:59:31.750 --> 02:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
for that generation
 
02:59:34.950 --> 02:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so there is a number so i come
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
back in the next annual year and i would
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:44.230 --> 02:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
claim those wrecks that you have
 
02:59:47.830 --> 02:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh generated by your calculation
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
am i
 
02:59:51.269 --> 02:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
tuning for that
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
and no the wrecks have to be again once
 
02:59:56.309 --> 02:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
we we estimate them and compliance is on
 
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
an annual basis so once that calendar
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
year is closed
 
03:00:05.269 --> 03:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's done um and again the that's why
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
the wrecks are being minted on a
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis through kneepool gis and
 
03:00:12.070 --> 03:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
then traded for compliance again on that
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
03:00:15.990 --> 03:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
so once that calendar year is closed out
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
from a compliance perspective those
 
03:00:22.389 --> 03:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
wrecks and and or that generation is
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
is in the past it's over it can't it
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
okay i think that answered my question
 
03:00:31.279 --> 03:00:33.190 align:start position:0%
okay i think that answered my question
um

03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
is why
 
03:00:36.550 --> 03:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
is the way i understand it is if i
 
03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:37.510 align:start position:0%
is the way i understand it is if i
didn't

03:00:37.510 --> 03:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:39.190 align:start position:0%
didn't
register

03:00:39.190 --> 03:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
register
 
03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:40.230 align:start position:0%
register
the

03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
calculated wrecks my system
 
03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
calculated wrecks my system
producing

03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
producing
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
are only eligible for that one year
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
and only if i was eligi uh registered if
 
03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
and only if i was eligi uh registered if
not

03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's no way for me to claim a value i
 
03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:04.150 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
uh

03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative samson did you have
 
03:01:08.469 --> 03:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman uh and uh
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to uh uh uh follow up on on a
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
couple things that uh first of all and i
 
03:01:19.830 --> 03:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a question but first of all
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
represent thomas mentioned about the
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
benefits that people uh induce for
 
03:01:24.880 --> 03:01:26.070 align:start position:0%
benefits that people uh induce for
everyone

03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh when they have solar energy in the in
 
03:01:31.030 --> 03:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
the grid and that is that is true
 
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
because basically we're helping to
 
03:01:36.389 --> 03:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
drive down demand on the grid when we
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
have solar installations
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh just as a comment to uh
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
represent pleuge and and uh rep ms
 
03:01:46.150 --> 03:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
crampton can correct me
 
03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
if you are not connected to the grid
 
03:01:51.830 --> 03:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
then there is nothing that's happening
 
03:01:53.349 --> 03:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
you don't get credit for your own
 
03:01:55.349 --> 03:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
credits that you generate
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
03:01:59.670 --> 03:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
puc cannot issue any credits on your
 
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
behalf because you are not on the grid
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh then the other thing is uh
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and let me just make sure i
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
understand uh miss crampton's
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
calculation here i think it's pretty
 
03:02:15.670 --> 03:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
simple simple
 
03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
basically what you're doing is you're
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
estimating the people putting into the
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
grid who are not registered you're
 
03:02:25.830 --> 03:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
estimating that based on the information
 
03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
you have from the utilities and based on
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
the registration database that you has
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
at the puc
 
03:02:33.750 --> 03:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
then you're taking the difference
 
03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
and you're normalizing that
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
to virtual credits
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and they are in fact really credits
 
03:02:46.230 --> 03:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
because the utility equates them with
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
the same obligation for credits that
 
03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
so even though they are not the actual
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
credits they are virtual credits and
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent in value to those credits
 
03:02:57.910 --> 03:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
because they're being used against their
 
03:02:57.920 --> 03:02:59.349 align:start position:0%
because they're being used against their
compliance

03:02:59.349 --> 03:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:05.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:03:05.429 --> 03:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:03:07.349 --> 03:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sanchez uh
 
03:03:09.190 --> 03:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
first of all yes you are correct in that
 
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
systems that are off grid in other words
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
not interconnected not net metering
 
03:03:16.150 --> 03:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
would not be part of any of this
 
03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:17.510 align:start position:0%
would not be part of any of this
discussion

03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
because the utilities don't have them on
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
their list and and and they can't be
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
certified uh or rec eligible if they're
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
off grid so that is correct
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
um the second part of your question
 
03:03:35.910 --> 03:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
the calculation of that estimation and i
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
guess what i do want to make sure that i
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
that i point out is that we are looking
 
03:03:44.399 --> 03:03:47.030 align:start position:0%
that i point out is that we are looking
at

03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
the the percent of the credit is the
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
same for all utilities so and and for
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
the competitive suppliers as well
 
03:03:56.710 --> 03:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
so we're not calculating an estimate for
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
eversource and saying that eversource
 
03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
gets to take this percentage away
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
it is a it is one number so it's total
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
03:04:09.990 --> 03:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and we are not looking at us at
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
actual generation for
 
03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:04:16.630 --> 03:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
percentage we are actually using that 20
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
capacity factor so we're taking again
 
03:04:20.790 --> 03:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
the total megawatts
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
that are interconnected but not rec
 
03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:25.429 align:start position:0%
that are interconnected but not rec
certified

03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
using a 20
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
capacity factor to estimate the
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
generation to then estimate
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the offset to the compliance
 
03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:38.950 align:start position:0%
the the offset to the compliance
obligation

03:04:38.950 --> 03:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you ms crampton we really
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here today and we
 
03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you taking
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions i'm going to call a recess on
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
this public hearing because we have
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
several members in attendance who have
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
obligations during the lunch hour
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
therefore including myself therefore we
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
will now adjourn for lunch and we will
 
03:04:59.680 --> 03:05:00.950 align:start position:0%
will now adjourn for lunch and we will
resume

03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
resume
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock at one o'clock i will
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on hb 3
 
03:05:09.030 --> 03:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
9 9 and recess it so that we can
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
continue the public hearing on hb 396.
 
03:05:14.550 --> 03:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
so thanks everybody we'll see you at one
 
03:05:14.560 --> 03:05:17.830 align:start position:0%
so thanks everybody we'll see you at one
o'clock

03:05:17.830 --> 03:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:17.840 --> 03:55:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.990 --> 03:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative parshall i think you
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
should play as a tune take yourself off
 
03:55:43.680 --> 03:55:49.429 align:start position:0%
should play as a tune take yourself off
mute

03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
oh sometime maybe not today but thank
 
03:55:51.600 --> 03:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
oh sometime maybe not today but thank
you

03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll sing along
 
03:55:54.830 --> 03:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
oh what do you
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
i think you're probably from the same
 
03:56:02.319 --> 03:56:04.710 align:start position:0%
i think you're probably from the same
period

03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'm sure that
 
03:56:10.150 --> 03:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard your father play some of
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
the songs that i would play how's that
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no no you are incorrect
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
i am a boomer i can i was singing songs
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
in the 80s i i started singing at 11 so
 
03:56:23.429 --> 03:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
i was actually singing in the 70s
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
i i know i know a lot of old songs
 
03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:28.389 align:start position:0%
i i know i know a lot of old songs
yeah

03:56:28.389 --> 03:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:29.590 --> 03:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
strange for me to say that i've been
 
03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
playing guitar for a half century now
 
03:56:34.210 --> 03:56:34.220 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting any better
 
03:56:34.220 --> 03:56:37.429 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting any better
[Laughter]

03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's the best part
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
hey i got a question for lee i think
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
she's listening he is
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe you can answer him
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
i sell i i put a solar uh station in my
 
03:56:51.510 --> 03:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
roof and i sell rex
 
03:56:54.630 --> 03:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
i no longer own that installation
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
i can
 
03:56:58.389 --> 03:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
oh you're on mute sorry lee
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
you own the installation
 
03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
you don't own the renewable attributes
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
of the energy you produced can i sell
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
but if i'm generating power
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
can i still sell that power back to
 
03:57:17.150 --> 03:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
the power company as well
 
03:57:17.160 --> 03:57:18.469 align:start position:0%
the power company as well
[Applause]

03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's selling the energy that
 
03:57:21.040 --> 03:57:21.910 align:start position:0%
that's that's selling the energy that
they're

03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:57:24.630 --> 03:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
selling the energy
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
and having the erection
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
are two different things
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
you have a property right
 
03:57:33.670 --> 03:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the renewable attributes
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you have a property right to the
 
03:57:39.030 --> 03:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
actual physical facility that generates
 
03:57:39.040 --> 03:57:40.309 align:start position:0%
actual physical facility that generates
energy

03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:57:40.319 --> 03:57:41.349 align:start position:0%
energy
so

03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
with direct sweeping you lose one but
 
03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
you maintain physical possession of the
 
03:57:47.439 --> 03:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
you maintain physical possession of the
facility

03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
and if you were actually generating and
 
03:57:53.349 --> 03:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
selling your electricity you would still
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
be able to sell that electricity you
 
03:57:57.910 --> 03:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
just couldn't advertise to anyone that
 
03:58:01.510 --> 03:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
it was created by renewable energy
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
lost the ability to claim that i just
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to remind everybody that the
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
session's still being recorded even
 
03:58:08.710 --> 03:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
though the chairman isn't back online
 
03:58:08.720 --> 03:58:09.830 align:start position:0%
though the chairman isn't back online
yet

03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
hey uh but uh incidentally news just
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are companies that will say we'll
 
03:58:18.469 --> 03:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
build this we'll we'll build the solar
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
collector on your roof and it's ours
 
03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to generate wrecks but
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
we'll compensate you in some way
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that church did that very same thing
 
03:58:29.110 --> 03:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
they own it
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know but but you're getting some
 
03:58:33.269 --> 03:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
compensation they also own the wrecks
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
usually so they're giving you some
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
compensation for that
 
03:58:39.189 --> 03:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
but if you own your own facility
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
then like lee sang that's your own
 
03:58:41.279 --> 03:58:43.110 align:start position:0%
then like lee sang that's your own
property

03:58:43.110 --> 03:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
now when you generate wrecks
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
whether you use them yourself or not
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
they're still your property
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
the question is do you want to sell it
 
03:58:53.590 --> 03:58:53.600 align:start position:0%
into the into the grid or not if you
 
03:58:53.600 --> 03:58:54.389 align:start position:0%
into the into the grid or not if you
don't

03:58:54.389 --> 03:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have to or if you're off the
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
grid it doesn't matter
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay and right now i had a i by some
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
people from uh i get one one of the
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
companies here in new hampshire give me
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
an estimate on a payback for me to
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
install the solar system
 
03:59:12.790 --> 03:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
under the current caps and all that
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they included directs
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
that i would receive back as that
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
estimate but i can't imagine those
 
03:59:19.269 --> 03:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
wrecks would add up to a lot under the
 
03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
current system
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that's because of the depression of
 
03:59:25.030 --> 03:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
having so many of those wrecks being
 
03:59:26.950 --> 03:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
right well value
 
03:59:28.150 --> 03:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
i learned something this is great every
 
03:59:31.750 --> 03:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
day you have to learn something new
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
every day
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
you do
 
03:59:34.560 --> 03:59:36.389 align:start position:0%
you do
well

03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
german votes if you just said something
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
you're on mute oh
 
03:59:40.560 --> 03:59:43.030 align:start position:0%
you're on mute oh
okay

03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everyone
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh jen if you could restart the
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
recording so that we could resume our
 
03:59:51.279 --> 03:59:52.830 align:start position:0%
recording so that we could resume our
activity

03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
activity
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
already you did okay
 
03:59:55.279 --> 03:59:56.389 align:start position:0%
already you did okay
good

03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:59:57.670 --> 03:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
since it is now
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
102 i will
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing
 
04:00:04.800 --> 04:00:05.830 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing
on

04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:00:05.840 --> 04:00:07.030 align:start position:0%

would like to continue
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to continue i don't want to
 
04:01:34.389 --> 04:01:34.399 align:start position:0%
take up time unnecessarily but i know
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
there are people waiting to speak um one
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%

04:01:40.960 --> 04:01:43.670 align:start position:0%
in particular is my son ian oxenom
right

04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%

mr oxendine

04:01:53.120 --> 04:01:53.990 align:start position:0%
you are given two minutes to speak
okay

04:01:53.990 --> 04:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:56.229 --> 04:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
my name is ian oxton i'm a practicing
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire attorney and i have a
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
degree in both energy regulation and law
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
so i do have some expertise on this
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
matter and i am of the opinion that
 
04:02:05.120 --> 04:02:06.469 align:start position:0%
matter and i am of the opinion that
uh

04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
rex supreme provision is
 
04:02:08.319 --> 04:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
rex supreme provision is
unconstitutional

04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
04:02:10.080 --> 04:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
now

04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
i one thing we want to correct is a
 
04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding i think some
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
representatives have
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
that this property interest only is
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
created when the record is registered
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
that is incorrect the property interest
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
direct represents the renewable energy
 
04:02:25.120 --> 04:02:26.229 align:start position:0%
direct represents the renewable energy
attribute

04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
attribute
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
exists independently of the wreck and
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
has created the moment the energy is
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
created and the original owner of that
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
property interest is the person who owns
 
04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
the system that created that renewable
 
04:02:38.000 --> 04:02:39.269 align:start position:0%
the system that created that renewable
energy

04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:02:39.279 --> 04:02:40.150 align:start position:0%
energy
the

04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
that right gives you the ability to
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
claim that you are a renewable energy
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
user so when that right is taken away
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
via wreck sweeping a person loses that
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
right for an individual this may just be
 
04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
a quasi psychic event for business this
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
actually matters quite a bit because if
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
you do not maintain ownership of
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy attribute you cannot
 
04:03:03.910 --> 04:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
legally market yourself as a renewable
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
energy user
 
04:03:07.750 --> 04:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
this also means that black sleeping in
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire means that businesses that
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
have installed their own solar rays
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
cannot claim to be solar-powered unless
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
to go to the time and expense of
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
registering and claiming rex it takes
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
money to
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
like and the idea that notice or is
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to cure this problem or that
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
people can just register and it's okay i
 
04:03:32.630 --> 04:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
say is that my time's up
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
do you still have 20 seconds okay
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay if uh
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
because you have to spend money to order
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
to prevent the property being taken that
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
is a big problem in my mind that
 
04:03:48.640 --> 04:03:49.429 align:start position:0%
is a big problem in my mind that
just

04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
and you should not have to spend money
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
in order to keep a property interest
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
that you created and that you're the
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
original owner of in order to be able to
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
claim that you are renewable energy use
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
and and not face a legal action from the
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
federal government for saying that
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you time's up appreciate your
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%

04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
else or am i gone because i was
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%

04:05:17.429 --> 04:05:17.439 align:start position:0%

you did thank you for testifying and for
 
04:05:22.160 --> 04:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
you did thank you for testifying and for
drafting

04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
past legislation and i'm assuming this
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
one as well or parts of it
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
my question to you is
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this is a
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional question
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't that constitutional
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
question be in court
 
04:05:42.640 --> 04:05:44.389 align:start position:0%
question be in court
um

04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:48.550 --> 04:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
this is was i believe that all the
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
rules we make or the rsas we write are
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
screened by ols that's their job however
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
some things do get through
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
and again i would ask don't you believe
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
that this sweeping issue
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
belongs in court
 
04:06:09.670 --> 04:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
and not in the legislature whether it's
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
constitution to decide constitutionality
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
so one for um can you hear me oh am i
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
muted no i can hear you okay good
 
04:06:20.479 --> 04:06:21.269 align:start position:0%
muted no i can hear you okay good
so

04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes this is something that could be
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
brought to a court i think that
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative oxford may have
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
got mixed on the question before that
 
04:06:32.229 --> 04:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
someone could bring a constitution
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
provide the person who had stayed so
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
they will one of the people being
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
deprived of property rights i believe
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
they could bring a constitutional action
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
however that does not
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
mean the legislature can't act on its
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
own to use its own constitutional powers
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
to draft and pass new legislation to
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
repeal an unconstitutional provision
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
and in many ways there i think are
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
advantages that go into legislative food
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
if possible it avoids the time and
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
expense of litigation that can drag on
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
it and
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
that as of also policy leasing is
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
independent of the constitutional issue
 
04:07:09.279 --> 04:07:10.389 align:start position:0%
independent of the constitutional issue
to

04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
change it but just because it's a
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem does not mean the
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislature ha have signed the
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislature has to wait for court to say
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
so yes it could be brought to court but
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think that means that it
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered by the
 
04:07:23.359 --> 04:07:25.030 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be considered by the
legislature

04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:27.439 --> 04:07:28.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative thompson do you have a
 
04:07:29.920 --> 04:07:32.309 align:start position:0%
representative thompson do you have a
question

04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr uh chairman and thank
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
you uh mr oxenham for coming to testify
 
04:07:39.279 --> 04:07:40.469 align:start position:0%
you uh mr oxenham for coming to testify
however

04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:07:42.870 --> 04:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any kind of legal
 
04:07:42.880 --> 04:07:43.750 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any kind of legal
action

04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:07:47.110 --> 04:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
as we just heard from ms crampton
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
the utilities don't actually identify
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
who they're sweeping from by name
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
so you know if i knew that they were
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
taking my property
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
i could say hey you're taking my
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
property i'm gonna go to court
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
i can't say that because it's anonymous
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
so i guess the only way you could do
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
that would be some class action by a
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
number of people who are being swept
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that we assume they are
 
04:08:16.710 --> 04:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
because you don't you can't identify the
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:22.710 --> 04:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's entirely correct i
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
giving a legal advice to the individuals
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
here but
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
04:08:32.150 --> 04:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
my view is that
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
as i read the statute
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who is not registered for rex is
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
being deprived of their renewable energy
 
04:08:42.150 --> 04:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
attributes automatically and so anyone
 
04:08:44.950 --> 04:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
who is not registered for x can claim to
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
be the victim on that basis
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
that is my reading of it i i don't want
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
to get into especially because you are a
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
person that who has a solo situation
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
yourself i want to
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
avoid inadvertently creating a trinity
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
client relationship so i don't want to
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
get into the details of legal advice on
 
04:09:01.530 --> 04:09:01.540 align:start position:0%
how the litigation might proceed
 
04:09:01.540 --> 04:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
how the litigation might proceed
[Music]

04:09:02.790 --> 04:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh mr excellent uh
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative samson remember we're not
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to debate here we're just
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask questions
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
all right so representative you're
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
04:09:17.910 --> 04:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh attorney
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
oxenoum for taking my question
 
04:09:20.319 --> 04:09:21.189 align:start position:0%
oxenoum for taking my question
um

04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
my question goes back to a point that i
 
04:09:25.349 --> 04:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
raised with an earlier speaker on this
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
same bill and that is one of um
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
the depression of the wreck market
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
because i think where the legislative
 
04:09:36.150 --> 04:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
body probably has um
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the obligation to act here is to
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
intercede in that the
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
the rps and the wreck market might not
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
be functioning properly if a large
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
segment of the wrecks are
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
are not being priced
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the and and still being included so
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
basically that value is being is
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
diluting the market and depressing the
 
04:10:01.110 --> 04:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
market at least that's the way i'm i'm
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out if that's an
 
04:10:04.150 --> 04:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
accurate way of looking at this because
 
04:10:05.110 --> 04:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
the skirting actually ends up hurting
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
the whole system
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's what since you said that
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
you have energy uh regulatory and legal
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
background i was wondering if you could
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
speak to that so you could clarify it
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
more for the for the committee
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes your understanding is broadly
 
04:10:23.590 --> 04:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
collect i just want to preface this by
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
though of all that is definitely a
 
04:10:27.990 --> 04:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
policy issue that by itself is not a
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue so for my legal for
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
the constitutional argument that that's
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
a separate issue and it's not one of
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional magnitude i think it's
 
04:10:38.150 --> 04:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
definitely a legitimate policy concern
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
but i would like to stress that even
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
apart from that issue there's a i
 
04:10:44.150 --> 04:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
believe a serious constitutional issue
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
with that said they go directly to your
 
04:10:45.760 --> 04:10:46.710 align:start position:0%
with that said they go directly to your
question

04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
you are correct that
 
04:10:50.309 --> 04:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
as karen crampton mentioned
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
when you
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
but lex sleeping effectively reduces the
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
demand for
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
electric utilities to release demand for
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
rex in the rps compliance market that
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
means utilities don't have to buy as
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
many wrecks that means there's less
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
demand for x
 
04:11:07.760 --> 04:11:08.469 align:start position:0%
demand for x
it

04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
if you hold supply equal and demand
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
decreases economics 101 tells you the
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
price is going to go down and that has
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
been observed in the actual market so
 
04:11:17.680 --> 04:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
been observed in the actual market so
yes

04:11:18.630 --> 04:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
we have a situation as a result of rex
 
04:11:20.800 --> 04:11:22.070 align:start position:0%
we have a situation as a result of rex
sweeping

04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
sweeping
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
silver uh class two wreck prices in
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular have gone down though i can't
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
tell you offside my head by how much and
 
04:11:31.189 --> 04:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
there's also been less need to make
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments in lieu
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
of x because
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
the small amount so there's also
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
probably been less money going to
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
right so it's a cascading problem
 
04:11:44.000 --> 04:11:45.429 align:start position:0%
right so it's a cascading problem
yes

04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%

04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
remembering the name of citizens climate
 
04:12:19.760 --> 04:12:21.110 align:start position:0%
remembering the name of citizens climate
lobby

04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
lobby
 
04:12:24.150 --> 04:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a citizen's grassroots group
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
with over 200 000 members worldwide
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
mostly in the us
 
04:12:28.560 --> 04:12:29.349 align:start position:0%
mostly in the us
and

04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
500 of them are in new hampshire
 
04:12:32.880 --> 04:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
500 of them are in new hampshire
and

04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
we are all not paid
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
volunteers and we're trying to educate
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
our energy policy leaders
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
about carbon pricing
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
in particular cash back carbon pricing
 
04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
which is where the money collected from
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel producers is returned to all
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
american households on equal basis each
 
04:12:52.560 --> 04:12:53.670 align:start position:0%
american households on equal basis each
month

04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
the reason we prefer this is it protects
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
households from the purchasing power or
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
it protects household purchasing power
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and actually most americans come out
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
ahead so it's citizens climate lobby or
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
if it's easier ccl
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
will suffice thank you for taking my um
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
comments i'm all in favor of this i've
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%

didn't sound like a good idea ever
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%

make sure that our energy providers are
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
using a good balance and working toward
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
increasing clean energy um in the mix
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
and collecting money to provide
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
investments in energy efficiency and and
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
other things that will help our state
 
04:13:41.760 --> 04:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
other things that will help our state
um

04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
last week when this topic came up one of
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
my friends said how do i get these
 
04:13:49.110 --> 04:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
energy wrecks
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i just like to give my comments
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
about this stuff as a
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
citizen this is really complicated stuff
 
04:13:54.720 --> 04:13:55.510 align:start position:0%
citizen this is really complicated stuff
and

04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
most people that install
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
solar in their homes have to learn a
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
real life
 
04:14:01.199 --> 04:14:02.070 align:start position:0%
real life
and

04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i think you
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
allow citizens to automatically get this
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
money the state should actually help
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
people sign up for these wrecks um there
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be information about it right
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
now eversource seems to be taking
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%

04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%

hb 487 is itl
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll send this to the
 
04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
consent calendar any objection
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
seeing none this bill will go to
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
consent and representative reggie you
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
will write the
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:25.110 --> 04:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll now close the exact session
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
on hb 487
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i will open an exec session
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
on house bill 3
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative thomas do you have a
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
motion to make on hb 351
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair uh on hb 351 i uh motioned
 
04:27:56.070 --> 04:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
representative homeless seconds the the
 
04:28:07.279 --> 04:28:08.790 align:start position:0%
representative homeless seconds the the
motion

04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:28:08.800 --> 04:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
motion
so

04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
04:28:13.990 --> 04:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
a motion on the floor to
 
04:28:14.000 --> 04:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
a motion on the floor to
render

04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
render
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
hb 351 is ought to pass is there any
 
04:28:18.080 --> 04:28:19.189 align:start position:0%
hb 351 is ought to pass is there any
discussion

04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
looks like representative mcgee would
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
like to discuss
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:28:27.990 --> 04:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
um i am looking back at the testimony
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we received unheard on the bill
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
and my understanding i don't have the
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of me for the numbers
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
for and against but i know that the
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate was very concerned
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
asking that we itl the bill because the
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
changes in the language would
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
severely curb
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
any monies being collected for
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency so our primary source
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
for funding energy efficiency efforts
 
04:28:56.070 --> 04:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
which are a four to one payback which
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
was also what we heard
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh in that testimony and so
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
since i we have very little chance to do
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
anything once you put these motions on
 
04:29:05.670 --> 04:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
the floor i would like people to
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that this is uh going
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
to severely severely curb the ability
 
04:29:11.120 --> 04:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
to severely severely curb the ability
for

04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
low-income folks to get money for
 
04:29:16.790 --> 04:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and also for the
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
investments that that program is
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
designed to support
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
which help all of us by creating
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
permanent cuts in the energy demands
 
04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:29:27.269 --> 04:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
so i uh
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
i realize we have a motion on the floor
 
04:29:31.110 --> 04:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
for ought to pass but i ask people to
 
04:29:33.110 --> 04:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
consider their vote to just going along
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
with this because this will have severe
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
implications in terms of the programs as
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
conceived by the states basically our
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
vote against the state
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh being able to offer energy efficiency
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
to the citizens thank you
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative harrington
 
04:29:49.920 --> 04:29:50.790 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative harrington
is

04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
recognized for
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
a comment uh thank you mr chairman uh
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
first let's uh clarify a few things this
 
04:29:58.870 --> 04:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
has no effect on programs for low-income
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
customers there's been no change to that
 
04:30:02.710 --> 04:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the bill whatsoever
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh it exactly stays the same that it's
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
been it's read it out as may include
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
programs for low-income customers
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
in energy efficiency programs what it
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
does is it does not change the total
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
funding at all it just says that energy
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs whose main purpose
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the consumption of
 
04:30:21.910 --> 04:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
electricity and not some other form of
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
energy and if you look at the uh actual
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
reports on this oh are you going to deal
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
with my dog here for a second
 
04:30:30.309 --> 04:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
easy wagon
 
04:30:30.319 --> 04:30:31.670 align:start position:0%
easy wagon
um

04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
you can see that
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
for the the last year we have figures
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
here which is uh 2019
 
04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
90 of the kilowatt hour savings uh took
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
48 of the costs 52 of the cost resulted
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
in only 10 percent of the savings and
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's because
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
the when we spend money on insulating
 
04:30:54.309 --> 04:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
houses we're doing very very little to
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the overall consumption of
 
04:30:55.920 --> 04:30:57.189 align:start position:0%
reduce the overall consumption of
electricity

04:30:57.189 --> 04:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
04:30:57.199 --> 04:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
electricity
and

04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is the
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge which means it
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
should benefit the system and insulating
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
somebody's house has a very very minor
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
amount of help at
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of electricity used
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
and hence benefiting the system so this
 
04:31:14.469 --> 04:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
does nothing to affect low-income
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
customers it does nothing to affect the
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
total amount of money spent it just says
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
let's spend more money when we get the
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
biggest bang for our buck and like i
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
said 60
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
dollars spent saved 14 of the kilowatt
 
04:31:29.439 --> 04:31:30.309 align:start position:0%
dollars spent saved 14 of the kilowatt
hours

04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
hours
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
and we should instead of spending it on
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
thermal insulation we should spend it on
 
04:31:34.319 --> 04:31:35.030 align:start position:0%
thermal insulation we should spend it on
the

04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
things that actually work at reducing
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
electric consumption where we get a much
 
04:31:41.910 --> 04:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
higher bang for the buck and that's
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
where for 48 of the total cost we
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
received 90 percent of the kilowatt hour
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
savings let's put all the money into
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
that category and really save some money
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
save some kilowatt hours and make it be
 
04:31:59.590 --> 04:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.830 --> 04:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
the question i had basically was
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
i would ask the chair
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
when we go through these bills if you
 
04:32:16.800 --> 04:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
when we go through these bills if you
could

04:32:17.830 --> 04:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
just uh give the date that they were
 
04:32:20.239 --> 04:32:21.910 align:start position:0%
just uh give the date that they were
heard

04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
or a brief introduction of the bill and
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
i we got that through the discussion but
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
it would be very helpful
 
04:32:31.990 --> 04:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh not having
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
been prepared ahead of time and i admit
 
04:32:34.720 --> 04:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
been prepared ahead of time and i admit
that

04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment i
 
04:32:41.590 --> 04:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
apologize to you for not uh
 
04:32:44.309 --> 04:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
reading the uh the title of the bill but
 
04:32:44.319 --> 04:32:45.269 align:start position:0%
reading the uh the title of the bill but
uh

04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
first reason my copy of the bill is no
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
longer in my notebook
 
04:32:50.159 --> 04:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
longer in my notebook
well

04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:32:51.120 --> 04:32:52.070 align:start position:0%
well
joy

04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
joy
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm glad i'm not the only one
 
04:32:56.000 --> 04:32:57.030 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm glad i'm not the only one
so

04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh next step would be uh
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative occident
 
04:33:02.880 --> 04:33:03.910 align:start position:0%
representative occident
yes

04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:33:05.750 --> 04:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're now in discussion mode are we not
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
i don't have to ask a question
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
with reference to uh representative
 
04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
harrington's remarks if you
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
weatherizing a house makes a very big
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
difference if you have a heat pump
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
the his distinction about whether the
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
system weatherization helps with
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
electricity costs yes it does and as
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
more and more people are moving away
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
from fossil fuel use to heat pumps that
 
04:33:33.990 --> 04:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be a larger larger
 
04:33:34.000 --> 04:33:36.709 align:start position:0%
is going to be a larger larger
percentage

04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
you're welcome next step would be
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:52.869 --> 04:33:52.879 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute representative
 
04:33:52.879 --> 04:33:54.949 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute representative
clementel

04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
clementel
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i apologize for
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that all sources of uh
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
heating use a certain amount of
 
04:34:01.840 --> 04:34:03.349 align:start position:0%
heating use a certain amount of
electricity

04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
um or almost all maybe a wood stove
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't but um
 
04:34:13.029 --> 04:34:13.039 align:start position:0%
i mean we we had people even small
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
electric companies like new hampshire
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
electric co-op who
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this bill
 
04:34:19.920 --> 04:34:21.029 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this bill
and

04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
the reason is that
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
basically the insulation
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
leaking of homes
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.680 --> 04:34:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
svc

04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
svc
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
and this pretty much
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
eliminates it
 
04:34:37.600 --> 04:34:38.629 align:start position:0%
eliminates it
unless

04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
somebody is also willing
 
04:34:41.279 --> 04:34:42.789 align:start position:0%
somebody is also willing
to

04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
change their heating system over to a
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
an uh a heat pump system which runs on
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
electricity but since the
 
04:34:53.670 --> 04:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
main beneficiary
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
of this uh of this
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
thermal uh use of
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
the sbc are low-income people insulating
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
their homes
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
reducing their
 
04:35:07.269 --> 04:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
yearly cost for their for energy in
 
04:35:10.240 --> 04:35:11.349 align:start position:0%
yearly cost for their for energy in
general

04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:35:11.359 --> 04:35:12.789 align:start position:0%
general
um

04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:15.750 --> 04:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
i am opposed to this
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh carving out of electrical use only
 
04:35:19.920 --> 04:35:20.869 align:start position:0%
uh carving out of electrical use only
as

04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
the prerequisite for using the sbc fund
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you next step is representative
 
04:35:35.600 --> 04:35:38.629 align:start position:0%
thank you next step is representative
man

04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh it seems to me
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
that the preference for saving kilowatt
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
hours and not even care at all
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
about other forms of energy or other
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
expenses by low income or anybody
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's totally arbitrary there's
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing that i know of in
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
prior legislation or anything
 
04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
that would justify this
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
and clearly um
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
i would also add that anybody that has
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh saving energy on
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
on uh saving kerosene or saving heating
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
fluid fuel is going to have some money
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
left over
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
so that the impact of the electric bill
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
won't be as bad
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
so uh i just don't understand
 
04:36:21.510 --> 04:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh the justification for this bill and i
 
04:36:23.429 --> 04:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
don't think it should uh
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's basically
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary okay thank you uh
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
representative mann next up is
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
um it is good to go back and look at
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
this stuff because we can't remember it
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
all in our heads we had some compelling
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
testimony by a couple of different
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
groups that i thought would be important
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
here because i think all of us did not
 
04:36:54.310 --> 04:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
have all of the points in our minds and
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
pieces of testimony was from unitil
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
who said that the legislation seeks to
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
subject the system benefits charge to
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislative or fiscal committee approval
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
for the filed plan that runs in 2021 to
 
04:37:08.561 --> 04:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
for the filed plan that runs in 2021 to
2023

04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
as outlined above we believe that the
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
current process is inclusive open to the
 
04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
public and provides a level of
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
administrative efficiency that may be
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
difficult to duplicate in either the
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
legislature or through approval by
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
another body ultimately this has the
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
potential to be detrimental to the
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
program's continuity and efficient
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
administration and could diminish the
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
benefits of that the three-year plan
 
04:37:35.429 --> 04:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
seeks to deliver to our customers so
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
again it on it it helps to undermine
 
04:37:41.029 --> 04:37:41.039 align:start position:0%
that three-year uh continuity plan that
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
we have for how
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency is going to be
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
administered which i think is one of the
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
big detriments that we should consider
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
before we vote to move this along this
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
is a bill that could be retained and
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
could be worked on and people have
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
offered to do that the new hampshire
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
electric co-op has offered to work with
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
us on that and then there's also
 
04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh the conclusion of the clean energy
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
testimony which brings in another point
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
which again i wouldn't be able to pull
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
at the ready unless i was looking at it
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
which is uh the language of the bill
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
says such benefits as approved by
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
regulators may include but not
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily be limited to
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
programs for low-income customers energy
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs and then the bolded
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
languages whose main purpose is to
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the consumption of electricity
 
04:38:25.750 --> 04:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
and not
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
some other forms of energy
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it says clean energy new hampshire
 
04:38:31.189 --> 04:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
supports a diverse range of energy
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs that benefit new
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire residences and businesses
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
and includes fuel neutral weatherization
 
04:38:40.390 --> 04:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
which significantly reduces energy
 
04:38:42.869 --> 04:38:42.879 align:start position:0%
burdens and improves public health clean
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire would like to
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
highlight that all system benefits
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
charge dollars spent on energy
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs are evaluated with
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
puc oversight by astringent cost benefit
 
04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
analysis to ensure that even
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
non-participants benefit dollars spent
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
on low income weatherizations or other
 
04:39:03.750 --> 04:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
programs not all of which focus on
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
reducing electricity alone are
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
authorized under statute rsa 374 f colon
 
04:39:10.080 --> 04:39:11.189 align:start position:0%
authorized under statute rsa 374 f colon
3.

04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
3.
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
no less than 20 of the portion of the
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
funds collected for energy efficiency
 
04:39:16.949 --> 04:39:16.959 align:start position:0%
shall be expended on low energy income
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs so i go back to what
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
i was sort of trying to say
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
parenthetically at the beginning which
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
passing this bill is going to undo the
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
purposes that we had for planning and
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
working through the public utilities
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
commission where there is an outlined
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
public process for them to decide
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
whether this stuff is actually cost
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
effective we're arbitrarily saying not
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
effective let's do away with it when
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
that is not what we have in evidence and
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
i would ask people to consider that when
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
they vote i think we should either i
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
tell it or retain it and try and make it
 
04:39:51.430 --> 04:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
better thank you
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and next up is representative
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
i just make sure i'm unmuted yes i am
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh let me just reiterate a couple
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
of things on what was said previously
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to undo this here but not too
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
much luck uh you can hear me i guess
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
i think the last speaker missed a comma
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
because it says such benefits as
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
approved by regulators may include
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
programs for low-income customers karma
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency programs whose main
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
purpose is to reduce the consumption of
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
electricity not some other form of
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
energy so it has no effect
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
on that second
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
whose main purpose does not affect
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
low-income customers and if you look to
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
later on in the bill you will see that
 
04:40:36.480 --> 04:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
later on in the bill you will see that
the

04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's what still remains in the law is
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
provided that however no less than
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
twenty percent of the portions of the
 
04:40:45.750 --> 04:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
funds collective energy efficiency shall
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
be expended on low income energy
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs that has not changed
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
so the idea that somehow we're taking
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
this away from low-income people for any
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
purpose is is uh just erroneous they can
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
still insulate low-income people's
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
houses what it says is i'll get back to
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
is the efficiency of it
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
the more money we spend on the programs
 
04:41:08.628 --> 04:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
that actually reduce electric use is
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of the system benefit
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
charges if people think we have a need
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
to subsidize insulating other than
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
low-income housing then put a tax on oil
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
put a tax on natural gas uh put a tax on
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
wood if you want to be transparent then
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
let those people be attacked that's what
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
it is let's not bury this tax inside of
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
our electric rates where no one even
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
knows they're paying to insulate houses
 
04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
if you went down and asked the average
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
person said oh do you know part of your
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
electric bill goes to insulate someone's
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
old farmhouse that they bought for three
 
04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
quarters of a million dollars they'd say
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
what are you talking about i don't pay
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
for that well you do
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
and that's that's the problem and i
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
think all this says is system benefit
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
charge should benefit the system and
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
insulating houses doesn't do it
 
04:41:59.990 --> 04:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
at all a very very tiny amount and if
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
you do have a
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
heat electric driven heat pump and you
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
can show that the main purpose of that
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency uh
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
improvement is to reduce the consumption
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
of electricity then it would qualify
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
under this
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
as far as the authorization goes again
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
this does not prevent the puc from
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
having hearings or from making
 
04:42:22.470 --> 04:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations or doing studies all
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
sorts of departments do that the bottom
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
line is if you want to increase the
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge the puc or any
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
other group should come to the
 
04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and say here's all the
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
reasons we want to increase or the
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge and then the
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
legislature would make the decision on
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
that we're not saying the legislature is
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
going to go out and do the study and do
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
the analysis someone would bring it to
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
us but because it's a charge
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
non-bipassable charge for every electric
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
customer in the state i think the
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislature should retain the authority
 
04:42:53.910 --> 04:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
to say if that's going to be increased
 
04:42:58.948 --> 04:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
04:43:08.000 --> 04:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
um

04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:09.600 --> 04:43:10.868 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
i would first like to point out to
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
everyone that uh the the blue sheet the
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
signed in to say how much they support
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
this bill we had 46 who said no
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
and three who said yes
 
04:43:30.480 --> 04:43:31.270 align:start position:0%
and three who said yes
the

04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
insulation issue is an interesting one
 
04:43:33.760 --> 04:43:34.708 align:start position:0%
insulation issue is an interesting one
because

04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
in fact uh insulation helps all energy
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
sources uh be more efficient
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's the electricity benefits from this
 
04:43:45.440 --> 04:43:46.390 align:start position:0%
it's the electricity benefits from this
too

04:43:46.390 --> 04:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
in fact as a good example i uh last year
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
i visited uh former representative
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
richardson's home in uh
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
up up in the north country
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:44:00.390 --> 04:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
he lives in a trailer park
 
04:44:03.030 --> 04:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
and guess what he heats with electric
 
04:44:03.040 --> 04:44:04.230 align:start position:0%
and guess what he heats with electric
heaters

04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
heaters
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
and he cools with
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
air conditioners
 
04:44:11.110 --> 04:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
his face his trailer could benefit
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
greatly from insulation and that would
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
impact his electricity use
 
04:44:16.240 --> 04:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
impact his electricity use
the

04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
other thing is we had testimony from
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
from our consumer advocate don crease
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
who adamantly suggested that this would
 
04:44:27.910 --> 04:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
affect the energy efficiency programs
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
here in in in our state uh in a dramatic
 
04:44:31.440 --> 04:44:32.390 align:start position:0%
here in in in our state uh in a dramatic
way

04:44:32.390 --> 04:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh we heard testimony from liberty
 
04:44:36.550 --> 04:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
utilities who said they were opposed to
 
04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
and and finally uh
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
the idea that the legislature would be
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
in charge of adjusting the sbc
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea because we are not
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
equipped to do that the puc is the best
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
equipped entity to do this so i think in
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
in a lot of areas here
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
this is not a good bill we don't need it
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
and the uh testimony
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly opposed it thank you very
 
04:45:04.480 --> 04:45:06.708 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly opposed it thank you very
much

04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:45:08.798 --> 04:45:11.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
mcgee

04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
um i understand we don't want to go back
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
back and forth back and forth back and
 
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
forth but um i myself and representative
 
04:45:21.910 --> 04:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
thomas were just appointed by the
 
04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house to the easy board
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
over at the public utilities commission
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
for energy efficiency and as i think
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
many of us know
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
um a three-year plan was just recently
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
put up
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
at the public utilities commission after
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
a long stakeholder process that included
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
the utilities who agreed to what their
 
04:45:43.110 --> 04:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency three-year plan would
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
be which was to provide stability to the
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
markets and an understanding of how the
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge and other aspects
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
of energy efficiency in new hampshire
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
would go forward over the next three
 
04:45:57.910 --> 04:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
puts a roadblock in the way
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
of that being able to happen so it what
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
it does is it inserts the legislature
 
04:46:07.990 --> 04:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
into a process that is at its conclusion
 
04:46:09.990 --> 04:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
and agreed by all parties including the
 
04:46:13.110 --> 04:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
utilities and says if we don't like it
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to ace it and and that and
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i take real exception to it because i
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
think it was representative man who used
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
the word arbitrary and i think that the
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
legislature should not be responsible
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
for arbitrary decisions when it comes to
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
energy because it affects so many people
 
04:46:28.798 --> 04:46:30.070 align:start position:0%
energy because it affects so many people
downstream

04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
downstream
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
and that's how i view this bill i think
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's not well conceived
 
04:46:37.350 --> 04:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
and if it has a specific objective
 
04:46:38.948 --> 04:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
other than
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking the authority away from the
 
04:46:42.948 --> 04:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
agency we've given authority to make
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
these decisions
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
then i would like to understand what it
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
is because i don't i don't think this
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislation achieves anything that
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
benefits the ratepayers of new hampshire
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and so i would like to see us
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
entertain retaining it and working on it
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
with the input of the utilities like
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
unitil offered
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
and like the new hampshire electric
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
co-op offered because the bill is not
 
04:47:09.430 --> 04:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time it's too disruptive
 
04:47:09.440 --> 04:47:10.310 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time it's too disruptive
to

04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh yeah i just wanted to
 
04:47:26.550 --> 04:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
repeat that and you know point out that
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
energy electric electricity is used in
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
any form of energy it's converted to
 
04:47:32.550 --> 04:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
light or heat
 
04:47:32.560 --> 04:47:33.430 align:start position:0%
light or heat
or

04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
it runs pumps to
 
04:47:36.638 --> 04:47:37.510 align:start position:0%
it runs pumps to
move

04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
move
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
fluids and so on
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
i can't think of any uh
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
exclusively energy or electric
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh use of electricity that isn't
 
04:47:49.830 --> 04:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
converted or associated with other
 
04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
sources of energy fuels and so on
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
except perhaps the electric chair so i i
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
think this whole thing is a
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
focus on electric
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
savings and nothing else is
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative man
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you as a chair
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
in light of the discussion
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps just a little more time might
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
need it i would request i would uh
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
request that i withdraw my motion from
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the otp
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
04:48:29.350 --> 04:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas has withdrawn
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
his motion for
 
04:48:31.040 --> 04:48:32.390 align:start position:0%
his motion for
otp

04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
otp
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:44.240 --> 04:48:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
otp

04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
otp
 
04:48:48.788 --> 04:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
and given the late hour i think i will
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i encourage you all to take a ten
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
minute break and then come back at two
 
04:48:59.360 --> 04:49:00.708 align:start position:0%
minute break and then come back at two
o'clock

04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
and i will just alert you to the fact
 
04:49:02.878 --> 04:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
and i will just alert you to the fact
that

04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
so 21 people signed up to speak on hb
 
04:49:11.040 --> 04:49:13.190 align:start position:0%
so 21 people signed up to speak on hb
213

04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
213
 
04:49:14.550 --> 04:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a very hectic
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing so
 
04:49:20.550 --> 04:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
gather your
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
energy and resources and get ready to go
 
04:49:26.550 --> 04:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock thank you
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
should i bring down some chocolate

what is that we're all sliding over here
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.440 --> 04:57:47.350 align:start position:0%

05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if can anyone hear me
 
05:00:10.868 --> 05:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
i'm here can you hear me
 
05:00:14.550 --> 05:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
i can hear you john thank you i can hear
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
you we're all muted the room was muted i
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
apologize for that i didn't realize it
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
had been muted
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we're back on
 
05:00:26.550 --> 05:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh for hp 103
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we have a list of 21 speakers but
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
we're asking michael harrington the
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill to introduce the
 
05:00:36.070 --> 05:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill go ahead thank you mr chairman uh
 
05:00:37.990 --> 05:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh does a couple of things the
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
most important thing it does is it
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
eliminates the archaic
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
provision that we have in here for the
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
old wood-burning plants
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
right now it says uh we have to buy
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
eight percent of our electricity has to
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
come from plants that basically no
 
05:00:56.070 --> 05:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
longer exists we've been told for years
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
and years that the i don't know how many
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
the total number is now there was six or
 
05:01:01.110 --> 05:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
seven or whatever
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
and we've been told this by senators and
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
by representatives of the business that
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
not only the hundreds of millions of
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
dollars in subsidies that they've
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
received over the years at above market
 
05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
rates going back to
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
the old qf days
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
that wasn't enough they needed more and
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's been bill after bill after bill
 
05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
to give their additional subsidies to
 
05:01:22.708 --> 05:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
these plants
 
05:01:24.788 --> 05:01:24.798 align:start position:0%
and most of those have failed and if we
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
believe the people that testified on
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
those bills they're all going to close
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
if they haven't already
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
but the fact remains that the law says
 
05:01:34.948 --> 05:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
we have to get eight percent of our
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
electricity from these plants that were
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
put online and i don't remember what the
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
year is now prior to
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
2002 or something like that a long time
 
05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
ago so no new plant can be built no new
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
wood burning plant can be built no
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
matter how efficient that could
 
05:01:51.910 --> 05:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh take the place of the class three
 
05:01:51.920 --> 05:01:52.948 align:start position:0%
uh take the place of the class three
wrecks

05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
05:01:54.550 --> 05:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
so it's time we've got rid of this
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
provision i've lowered it down to one
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
percent so that the uh
 
05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
it includes methane gas providers the
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
ones that are still uh in operation
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
could still get uh get wrecks but
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
there'd be no requirement
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise because the way it's going
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
to be with these plants closing or
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
closed the utilities would have to go
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
out and buy alternate compliance
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
payments up to eight percent of their
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
total sales
 
05:02:21.030 --> 05:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that was never the intent of the
 
05:02:22.868 --> 05:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard it wasn't
 
05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
to force the utilities to buy
 
05:02:27.270 --> 05:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
electricity that you can't purchase and
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
like i said not only can't you purchase
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
it because these plants are closed even
 
05:02:33.430 --> 05:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
if new plants opened up they don't fill
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
that gap because this is a talk about
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
super special interest group this is it
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
says only can be bought by these plants
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
that were built and went online years
 
05:02:42.240 --> 05:02:43.110 align:start position:0%
that were built and went online years
ago

05:02:43.110 --> 05:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
so that would eliminate that um
 
05:02:48.390 --> 05:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
that super subsidy because it's no
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
longer necessary because we've been told
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
these plants simply can't run not only
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
with this subsidy but they need millions
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
of dollars of more subsidies which we've
 
05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
repeatedly refused to pass
 
05:03:01.510 --> 05:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i mean they had a good run and i
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
guess they're going to all close if they
 
05:03:02.958 --> 05:03:03.830 align:start position:0%
guess they're going to all close if they
haven't

05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
05:03:05.670 --> 05:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
the other part about this is on getting
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
rid of what called useful thermal energy
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
which is been put in here which has
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electricity
 
05:03:12.718 --> 05:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electricity
whatsoever

05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
again that the renewable portfolio
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
standard was supposedly to
 
05:03:20.550 --> 05:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh force people to buy
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh electricity that they wouldn't
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise buy
 
05:03:25.750 --> 05:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
meaning renewal from renewable sources
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i say force because when i was on
 
05:03:29.830 --> 05:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
some of you may or may not know there's
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
a bill in new hampshire that says the
 
05:03:35.670 --> 05:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
utilities must provide up to a hundred
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
percent renewal energy to any customer
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
that asks for it but there was a out in
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
the bill if not enough people
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh asked for that
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
such that the administrative cost was so
 
05:03:49.750 --> 05:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
high the utilities could come to the puc
 
05:03:52.628 --> 05:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
and ask for relief they did that
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
and when they came we found that the
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
people who were voluntarily willing
 
05:04:01.110 --> 05:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
to pay extra money for renewable energy
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
was somewhere a little bit less than 0.1
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
so because of that the puc granted
 
05:04:07.200 --> 05:04:08.150 align:start position:0%
so because of that the puc granted
relief

05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
relief
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
to the utilities and no longer had them
 
05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
have to offer this program because it
 
05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
was costing a lot of money
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
administratively and let's face it
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted it
 
05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
i asked representatives of the utilities
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
well what have you done to get this
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
across they said we've done bill folders
 
05:04:25.830 --> 05:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
we've done advertising we've gone on a
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
website and says why is it and they go
 
05:04:30.550 --> 05:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
well people just don't want to pay more
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
for electricity than they have to
 
05:04:32.798 --> 05:04:33.830 align:start position:0%
for electricity than they have to
and

05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of the basic premise of this
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
this whole bill but
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
we don't need to get into that so much
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
today so the useful thermal energy has
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electricity shouldn't
 
05:04:47.190 --> 05:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
be subsidized by the electric users
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's been some companies that make a
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
particular product that are very good at
 
05:04:53.590 --> 05:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
lobbying and it they it passed get this
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
bill passed so they can make a lot of
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
money at the expense of the rate payers
 
05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
one of the changes i'll be making i'll
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
be putting an amendment into the bill on
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
this is that and it's kind of an
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
oversight at my part that's been brought
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
to my attention by a number of people is
 
05:05:06.240 --> 05:05:07.350 align:start position:0%
to my attention by a number of people is
that

05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's a good idea
 
05:05:11.590 --> 05:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
or a bad idea we told people they could
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
get thermo uh
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy wrecks and they
 
05:05:17.750 --> 05:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
invested money accordingly and it's not
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
fair to pull the rug out from under them
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i'll be changing the bill to say this
 
05:05:24.550 --> 05:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
is a going forward bill and any project
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's been grandfathered in will
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
continue to get their wrecks just out of
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
out of fairness and
 
05:05:33.830 --> 05:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's about
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative harrington
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
any uh questions for representative
 
05:05:43.520 --> 05:05:44.708 align:start position:0%
any uh questions for representative
harrington

05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
looking around the room here
 
05:05:49.270 --> 05:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
see any hands up
 
05:05:51.750 --> 05:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i've got my hand up
 
05:05:53.360 --> 05:05:53.370 align:start position:0%
no i was talking about in the room
 
05:05:53.370 --> 05:05:54.830 align:start position:0%
no i was talking about in the room
[Music]

05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:05:58.708 --> 05:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
sorry uh so the first step i guess is uh
 
05:06:02.230 --> 05:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
i uh thank you for considering an
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to well consider uh
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me i can barely hear you
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
oh well let me see if i can fix that is
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
that better much better thank you i
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
apologize and thank you for answering my
 
05:06:14.878 --> 05:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
apologize and thank you for answering my
question

05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:06:15.840 --> 05:06:16.868 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your considering an
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
amendment to grandfather those in that
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
made installations and depending upon
 
05:06:26.310 --> 05:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
those racks to make those installations
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
cost efficient
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
um we are speaking mostly of pellet
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
stoves and the like of which my local
 
05:06:31.600 --> 05:06:32.550 align:start position:0%
stoves and the like of which my local
small

05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:06:34.310 --> 05:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
has uh installed
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
would you consider something like that
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh specific technology moving forward in
 
05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
your amendment as well
 
05:06:41.920 --> 05:06:42.708 align:start position:0%
your amendment as well
um

05:06:42.708 --> 05:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
again what i'm trying to do here is
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
you might have got a theme here from
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
some of my bills and the theme is that
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
let's not
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
bury subsidies in the electric bills
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we're open and
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
transparent about it so if we want to
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
turn around and give a subsidy for
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
something let's go out and put it put a
 
05:07:04.948 --> 05:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
tax on something or take it out of the
 
05:07:06.390 --> 05:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
general fund or whatever
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
but the electric rate pays should not be
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
burdened with paying subsidies for
 
05:07:11.760 --> 05:07:13.030 align:start position:0%
burdened with paying subsidies for
basically

05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know because some town puts in wood
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
chips or whatever and like i said we're
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
not going to it's not going to be
 
05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
retroactive whoever's put one of those
 
05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
wood chip boilers in will continue to
 
05:07:23.830 --> 05:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
get their wrecks but if someone wants to
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
put one in after the enactment of this
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
law if it's enacted they're going to
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
have to do it because it was energy
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
efficient and cost effective without the
 
05:07:31.520 --> 05:07:34.708 align:start position:0%
efficient and cost effective without the
subsidy

05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you well you're very welcome
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay and next up is representative
 
05:07:39.360 --> 05:07:41.110 align:start position:0%
okay and next up is representative
murray

05:07:41.110 --> 05:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
murray
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative harrington um i have the
 
05:07:46.788 --> 05:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
legal definition in front of me of
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy
 
05:07:50.230 --> 05:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
can you kind of give me your perspective
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
of your layman's view of what useful
 
05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
thermal energy means examples of it um
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
how you define it thank you
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i've
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
i'll only how it's defined in the law
 
05:08:06.390 --> 05:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and useful thermal energy could simply
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
means for the most part for an example
 
05:08:09.030 --> 05:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:08:12.550 --> 05:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
a as the previous speaker spoke uh a
 
05:08:14.550 --> 05:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
school system for example replaces an
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
oil fired burner for their heating
 
05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
system with a wood chip one
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
right now they'd be able to get uh
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
credits for that and they'd be they'd be
 
05:08:25.270 --> 05:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
getting they would get the subsidy from
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
the rate payers for it
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
my point is that
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with electric
 
05:08:32.708 --> 05:08:32.718 align:start position:0%
rate payers and electric rate pay should
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
not be the source of that money it
 
05:08:36.390 --> 05:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be buried in the in the
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
electric rates where no one even knows
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're paying for it if we want to
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
subsidize the conversion of oil to wood
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you think that's a good idea
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
then we should have a new tax or bring
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
it out of the general fund and let
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
everybody know what we're actually doing
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
and useful thermal energy is not it's
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
not the point in my bill it's the thing
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
the point is however you define it it
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do with saving
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
electricity which uh or using greener
 
05:09:02.878 --> 05:09:04.708 align:start position:0%
electricity which uh or using greener
electricity

05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
and that's the point of the renewable
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard is to push people to
 
05:09:12.390 --> 05:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
use force people to buy more renewable
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
electric energy not necessarily thermal
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
energy or other types of energy
 
05:09:18.080 --> 05:09:19.830 align:start position:0%
energy or other types of energy
follow-up

05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:09:19.840 --> 05:09:21.350 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
so your wood chip is an example of
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
useful thermal energy
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's useful to the people that install
 
05:09:30.550 --> 05:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
it sure i think it's useful it's
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
certainly not unusual it just has
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with electric rates and it
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with
 
05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
the point of the renewable portfolio
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
standard which is to force people to buy
 
05:09:43.830 --> 05:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
certain types of electricity the fact
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
that someone puts in a wood chip
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
furnace has nothing to do with what type
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
of electricity everybody buys but
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the electric rate payers
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
have to pay a subsidy to that wood chip
 
05:09:57.990 --> 05:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
boiler under existing law
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just looking for the
 
05:09:59.280 --> 05:10:03.430 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just looking for the
definition

05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay next step is representative sanchez
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
some sich
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative harrington for taking my
 
05:10:12.798 --> 05:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
representative harrington for taking my
question

05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:10:13.840 --> 05:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh i got uh uh
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
two questions for you uh the
 
05:10:21.990 --> 05:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the fact that the
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
complex just put in
 
05:10:25.920 --> 05:10:26.868 align:start position:0%
complex just put in
a

05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
i believe it put in a
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
furnace a wood furnace system
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
part of its financing is dependent on
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
these kind of subsidies but i think they
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
may have done it to be both clean as
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
well as more domestic source of energy
 
05:10:45.990 --> 05:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
they could have switched from something
 
05:10:47.590 --> 05:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
else and that could have been
 
05:10:47.600 --> 05:10:51.830 align:start position:0%
else and that could have been
electricity

05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your question uh i'm
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
not i'm not aware of specifics there but
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
again if they've already done this under
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
what my proposed amendment they would be
 
05:11:03.350 --> 05:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in so uh that's that's not
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue the fact that
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're they've they've chose to go with
 
05:11:09.910 --> 05:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh would i assume some kind of wood
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
boiler you're talking about that's
 
05:11:14.230 --> 05:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine if it's especially i think
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
what i've seen uh we will there's a lot
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
of places where wood's very competitive
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
with oil without a subsidy so i have no
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
problem with doing that i'm just saying
 
05:11:25.910 --> 05:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be burying the
 
05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
subsidies for these projects in the
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
electric race if you think it's a good
 
05:11:32.788 --> 05:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
idea then come out and propose a tax
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
propose taking out of the general fund
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
but don't we're supposed to be
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
transparent here let's not bury these
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
these subsidy costs in electric rates
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
where no one can even find out what they
 
05:11:42.718 --> 05:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
where no one can even find out what they
are

05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up mr chair hello
 
05:11:51.030 --> 05:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
oh thank you uh so uh looking at your
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
05:11:52.480 --> 05:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
bill uh
um

05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm kind of shocked by the impact of
 
05:12:00.070 --> 05:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
your bill on the rps
 
05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
as we know the rps is kind of a goal
 
05:12:04.550 --> 05:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
setting standard for us for renewable
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
energy sources
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
so if i look at your bill um
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
we originally had in 2015
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
the total amount for the rps renewal
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
manager was 15.8 percent
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
and that was that was night 2015 it was
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go to
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
a dramatic 18.2
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
in 10 years in 2025.
 
05:12:31.030 --> 05:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
the result of your bill today is to
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the total amount down to 8.8
 
05:12:34.560 --> 05:12:35.670 align:start position:0%
reduce the total amount down to 8.8
percent

05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:12:37.750 --> 05:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't you think that's a really dramatic
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
crop and and how do we make that up
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i mean i
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
guess it comes down to your basic
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
position on your opinion of the
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
intelligence of the public of the state
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire um
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
i i believe that the people of new
 
05:12:54.628 --> 05:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire are smart enough to make a
 
05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
decision on what type of electricity
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
they need or want to buy
 
05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we've certainly been inundated with
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
all sorts of information on global
 
05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
warming and
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
since uh earth day of 1970 with dire
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
predictions that most of which don't
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
come true but
 
05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
everybody should be able to make the
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves i would prefer
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
that all the renewable energy companies
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
rather than spend their time and money
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
coming to concord and lobbying and i'm
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
sure we're going to hear from people
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
here lobbyists who've been paid tens of
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
thousands of maybe hundreds of thousands
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
of dollars over the year to lobby for
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
their particular special interest group
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would rather have them use it like
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
most products do or used to do in the
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
united states anyway and use advertising
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
and education as a reason for people to
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
buy their product if the renewable
 
05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
energy products are even half as good as
 
05:13:48.550 --> 05:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
they claim they are they won't have to
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
force anybody to buy them so going
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
forward we've certainly like i said
 
05:13:55.990 --> 05:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware of the of the climate
 
05:13:58.390 --> 05:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
issues everyone's heard of they can make
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
their own decisions and if people want
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
to go out they can go to the puc website
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
you can look at companies there i
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
haven't looked in the last couple of
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
months but there were ones there 100
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
percent wind 100
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
renewables if people want renewable
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
energy they can get it and if they want
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
more of it the market will be there for
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
it i just don't believe that the
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
government should turn around and say
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
you people of new hampshire are either
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
too stupid or too ignorant to make a
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
decision on what type of electricity to
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
buy so we're going to tell you what you
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
have to buy i believe the people in new
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire are smart enough to make that
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you next step is
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh the problem i'm looking at the bill
 
05:14:52.708 --> 05:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
and i'm not understanding
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh the part about methane and the source
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
will this bill
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
besides impacting jobs
 
05:15:07.830 --> 05:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh
 
05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
05:15:14.550 --> 05:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
the specific it has it allows the one
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
percent for the methane gas which i was
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
told is about the amount of the total
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
production so it will have no effect on
 
05:15:22.080 --> 05:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
production so it will have no effect on
the

05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
rochester landfill methane gas provided
 
05:15:26.878 --> 05:15:28.628 align:start position:0%
rochester landfill methane gas provided
to

05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
unh at all that's why that's why the one
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
percent exception was left on the bill
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
and as far as jobs go you bring up the
 
05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
subject we have to note everybody always
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
talks about the jobs that are created
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
when the government collects a pile of
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
money and they you know you collect uh
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars from a hundred up
 
05:15:50.550 --> 05:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
from a hundred thousand people you got a
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
lot of money and then you show up and
 
05:15:54.550 --> 05:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
say look at the jobs we created but all
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
the those millions of dollars that are
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
taken out of the economy are jobs that
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
weren't created that companies that say
 
05:16:02.948 --> 05:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
the electric rates are too high in new
 
05:16:04.390 --> 05:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i'm not going to expand
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
here there's other things that aren't
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
done investments that aren't done
 
05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
people don't take the money and people
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
say well it's only you know five dollars
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
a month whatever they don't take the
 
05:16:14.708 --> 05:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
five dollars a month and bury it in
 
05:16:16.628 --> 05:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
their backyard they go out and spend it
 
05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
on other things that as they determine
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
best so this this idea of job losses i
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
think you can look towards uh
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
spain in the in the last uh few decades
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
ago where they went heavily into
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and they found for
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
every job was created from renewable
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
energy jobs which were visible in the
 
05:16:36.868 --> 05:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
long term they lost three
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
so we never hear about the jobs that
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
weren't created the jobs that were lost
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
because the electric rates go up this
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
concept that only the government can
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
create jobs i don't agree with
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
whatsoever i think the most efficient
 
05:16:50.948 --> 05:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
way of creating jobs is leaving the
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
hands of the money in the hands of the
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
people who earned it and let them decide
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
how to spend it because they have they
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
have skin in the game and i can tell you
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
as a former puc commissioner when we
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
approve projects we all do the best we
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
can but if one of those projects didn't
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
work out it didn't cost me any money i
 
05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't getting fired no one at the puc
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
was but if i had done that where i
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
worked and when i worked in private
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
industry and i pushed a project and it
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
failed i probably would have lost my job
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
so that's a big difference this whole
 
05:17:22.070 --> 05:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
concept of jobs you always miss the jobs
 
05:17:23.910 --> 05:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
that aren't created because the money
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
stayed in circulation with the people
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
who earned it
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
i follow
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
the follow-up is that i remember the
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
help the north country in particular
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
with development and all the industry
 
05:17:46.470 --> 05:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
and everything that surrounds
 
05:17:46.480 --> 05:17:47.270 align:start position:0%
and everything that surrounds
the

05:17:47.270 --> 05:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:50.310 --> 05:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
plant i want to go back to this
 
05:17:50.320 --> 05:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
plant i want to go back to this
particular

05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
lines in this bill and make sure
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
that where it says from a source of
 
05:18:05.110 --> 05:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
sources which began prior to 2006
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
will that exempt
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
so we will not allow any new or will not
 
05:18:10.638 --> 05:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
so we will not allow any new or will not
subsidize

05:18:11.990 --> 05:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
subsidize
 
05:18:14.708 --> 05:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
any new methane plants which is another
 
05:18:14.718 --> 05:18:15.750 align:start position:0%
any new methane plants which is another
way

05:18:15.750 --> 05:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
to use the landfills and
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
was rochester created
 
05:18:21.360 --> 05:18:22.430 align:start position:0%
was rochester created
before

05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:18:22.440 --> 05:18:24.230 align:start position:0%
before
2006.

05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
2006.
 
05:18:25.830 --> 05:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question
 
05:18:29.190 --> 05:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative that
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
my proposed changes to the law has no
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
effect on that whatsoever it doesn't
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
change it that whatever was in effect
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
there is still an effect
 
05:18:43.830 --> 05:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
05:18:46.708 --> 05:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
what i'm proposing is a change in law
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
has no effect on
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
that portion
 
05:18:50.798 --> 05:18:51.990 align:start position:0%
that portion
well

05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
i see a new part excuse me i see a new
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
part that says from methane gas so i'm
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little concerned thank you
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd remind people members that
 
05:19:05.590 --> 05:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're not here to debate we're here to
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
ask questions
 
05:19:09.590 --> 05:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
and gather information
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
so seeing no other questions for
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
representatives harrington i will call
 
05:19:17.190 --> 05:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
on the next speaker
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i would remind everyone that we have
 
05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
40 minutes to go in this public hearing
 
05:19:25.270 --> 05:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
and about 20 speakers left
 
05:19:28.310 --> 05:19:28.320 align:start position:0%

05:19:54.160 --> 05:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
me um i was very interested in
representative

05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
harrington's uh talk so i'm hunter
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
carvey i'm in the private sector i've
 
05:20:02.708 --> 05:20:02.718 align:start position:0%
been in the forest industry for over 40
 
05:20:02.718 --> 05:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
been in the forest industry for over 40
years

05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
and i've watched it change over those 40
 
05:20:06.958 --> 05:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
and i've watched it change over those 40
years

05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:20:08.080 --> 05:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
years
um

05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to say that you know when
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
we talk about jobs
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and money staying within the economy
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
um the wood payments that go out to
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
these companies is local money that
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
stays right in our state economy
 
05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it is highly beneficial these jobs
 
05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
are dependent on the rps
 
05:20:32.320 --> 05:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
are dependent on the rps
and

05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
not only that
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
is there's great risk
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
of what could happen in the future
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
to our forest in terms of health
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
productivity we have insects we have
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
emerald ash borer issues that we've
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
tried to take care of there's other
 
05:20:50.788 --> 05:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
threats out there in 1998
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
we had a massive ice storm that went
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
across our state the northern part
 
05:20:57.990 --> 05:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
we had two paper mills then plus biomass
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
plants and they could barely handle the
 
05:21:02.550 --> 05:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
cleanup of that wood which took years
 
05:21:04.868 --> 05:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
we are at a high risk now forest fire
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
dangers in the future so
 
05:21:08.948 --> 05:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
there's much more implications that
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
could happen by
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
eliminating these wood racks whether
 
05:21:14.788 --> 05:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's thermal and the biomass glands the
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
biomass plants also are the foundation
 
05:21:23.430 --> 05:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the entire forest industry 30 seconds
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
so there's you know two-thirds of our
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
forest is mostly low-grade and so that's
 
05:21:28.240 --> 05:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
forest is mostly low-grade and so that's
forcing

05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
forcing
 
05:21:31.270 --> 05:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
the companies now that are struggling to
 
05:21:31.280 --> 05:21:32.470 align:start position:0%
the companies now that are struggling to
survive

05:21:32.470 --> 05:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
survive
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
to cut the best and leave the rest we're
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
not able to do the good forestry
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'd want to give plenty of time for
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
other speakers thank you for for
 
05:21:40.798 --> 05:21:42.390 align:start position:0%
other speakers thank you for for
listening

05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%

uh

05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%

um i not only represent the rye energy
 
05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
committee but our select board
 
05:22:18.868 --> 05:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
and representative jackie grody from our
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
local state representative
 
05:22:24.390 --> 05:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
is also on board with our request
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh we're very concerned about the rps
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:32.948 --> 05:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
new england
 
05:22:34.708 --> 05:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
is well ahead
 
05:22:37.750 --> 05:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
of where new hampshire is on rps and we
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
just keep falling further and further
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
behind which is a concern
 
05:22:43.990 --> 05:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're just charting a very different
 
05:22:44.000 --> 05:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
we're just charting a very different
course

05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
and uh that concerns us in a big way
 
05:22:49.120 --> 05:22:50.390 align:start position:0%
and uh that concerns us in a big way
um

05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
another item
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
we are now having solar proposal on
 
05:22:55.440 --> 05:22:56.470 align:start position:0%
we are now having solar proposal on
board

05:22:56.470 --> 05:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
for approval for our local school system
 
05:23:02.070 --> 05:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
and we feel that by going backwards on
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
this standard it not only teaches our
 
05:23:05.120 --> 05:23:06.310 align:start position:0%
this standard it not only teaches our
students

05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
and our parents the wrong goal the wrong
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
mission in which way we should be going
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
we think this these projects could be
 
05:23:13.280 --> 05:23:14.868 align:start position:0%
we think this these projects could be
jeopardized

05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
jeopardized
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
so we're very concerned about this uh
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh for that testimony uh
 
05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
05:23:34.390 --> 05:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you for taking my question
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd go back to what i previously
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
said so you don't believe that given the
 
05:23:40.550 --> 05:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
ability to choose what type of
 
05:23:42.310 --> 05:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
electricity to buy that the people of
 
05:23:45.030 --> 05:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire will buy the right type mr
 
05:23:46.550 --> 05:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
chairman i don't believe that
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has the right
 
05:23:50.230 --> 05:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
to question anyone
 
05:23:52.150 --> 05:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm asking a question i'm asking i know
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
but you are the sponsor of this bill sir
 
05:23:56.470 --> 05:23:56.480 align:start position:0%

and my bad as well i've i've
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
forgot that representative aaron didn't

05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who would like to
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative or this testifier
 
05:24:19.830 --> 05:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
there is no one there so next we'll call
 
05:24:22.240 --> 05:24:25.670 align:start position:0%
there is no one there so next we'll call
on

05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who apparently signed up
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
to speak we're not actually here so
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.670 --> 05:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
get this rolling along
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
well here's somebody i know who's on the
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
listings here so i'm going to recognize
 
05:24:52.708 --> 05:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
next charles needling mr nibbling that

floor for three minutes
 
05:25:01.590 --> 05:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman and
 
05:25:03.030 --> 05:25:03.040 align:start position:0%

headquartered in new hampshire um
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm speaking today in opposition to
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 213 in its entirety
 
05:25:25.990 --> 05:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
it probably would be most appropriate
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the time i have to focus on the
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
thermal or the proposal to repeal the
 
05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
class one
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
useful thermal carve out
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
i have some
 
05:25:39.750 --> 05:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the history of the
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
enactment of of
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the rps which dates to
 
05:25:44.840 --> 05:25:46.628 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the rps which dates to
2012

05:25:46.628 --> 05:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
2012
 
05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the passage of senate bill 218 that
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
year which incidentally
 
05:25:54.550 --> 05:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh passed the house 275 to six
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
the senate 23 to nothing and the
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
committee of conference report
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
was adopted by the house 292 to 52 and
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
the senate 23 to nothing
 
05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
so it had very broad support and it made
 
05:26:09.430 --> 05:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
a number of changes to the rps but
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
probably the most substantive was the
 
05:26:12.000 --> 05:26:13.350 align:start position:0%
probably the most substantive was the
decision

05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
by the general court to expand the scope
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the rps to encompass more than just
 
05:26:19.920 --> 05:26:21.670 align:start position:0%
of the rps to encompass more than just
electricity

05:26:21.670 --> 05:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's true and it's a
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
fair statement on the part of of the
 
05:26:25.600 --> 05:26:26.868 align:start position:0%
fair statement on the part of of the
sponsor

05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
that the electric rate payer is being
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
asked to
 
05:26:33.670 --> 05:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
underwrite the cost of incentives for
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
thermal renewable energy in the state of
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that issue was debated by the
 
05:26:40.830 --> 05:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
general court in
 
05:26:43.510 --> 05:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
2012 quite extensively
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
and uh notwithstanding statements
 
05:26:49.510 --> 05:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
of of various people with different
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
perspectives the decision of the general
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
court was to adopt
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
the addition of thermal to the rps
 
05:26:59.830 --> 05:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
quite overwhelmingly i would add that
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has been recognized as a
 
05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
national leader
 
05:27:05.830 --> 05:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
for its decision to expand the scope of
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
its rps to include thermal
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
and 11 other states have now followed
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's lead including most
 
05:27:14.628 --> 05:27:14.638 align:start position:0%
recently the state of maine
 
05:27:16.550 --> 05:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts vermont now has a
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thermal provision
 
05:27:22.550 --> 05:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
and a number of other states as well so
 
05:27:24.390 --> 05:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
little new hampshire has
 
05:27:26.070 --> 05:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
shown the way
 
05:27:26.080 --> 05:27:28.230 align:start position:0%
shown the way
um

05:27:28.230 --> 05:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
other people will speak to the impacts
 
05:27:33.910 --> 05:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
that repeal this provision will have
 
05:27:36.548 --> 05:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
on their projects many of which were
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
financed with the expectation of revenue
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
from the sale of thermal wrecks 30
 
05:27:42.240 --> 05:27:43.190 align:start position:0%
from the sale of thermal wrecks 30
seconds

05:27:43.190 --> 05:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman there
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
are 58 projects in the state that now
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
now qualify
 
05:27:52.150 --> 05:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh a number of them are public and
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
non-profit institutions as well as
 
05:27:54.718 --> 05:27:57.030 align:start position:0%
non-profit institutions as well as
businesses

05:27:57.030 --> 05:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to thank you mr chairman i would
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
be opposed to the sponsors amendment
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
because it forecloses on the opportunity
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
for others
 
05:28:05.760 --> 05:28:06.390 align:start position:0%
for others
to

05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
invest in in a new direction for the
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire displacing our
 
05:28:12.470 --> 05:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
dependence on
 
05:28:14.628 --> 05:28:14.638 align:start position:0%
imported and non-renewable fossil
 
05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
heating fuels
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
with fuels and technologies that we
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
control here in the state of new
 
05:28:20.320 --> 05:28:21.910 align:start position:0%
control here in the state of new
hampshire

05:28:21.910 --> 05:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you i would i would be
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
delighted to answer any questions and
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
serve as a resource to the committee as
 
05:28:28.708 --> 05:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
you determine the fate of this bill
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
 
05:28:32.878 --> 05:28:33.910 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
uh

05:28:33.910 --> 05:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman
 
05:28:42.628 --> 05:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
um so my my first question to you mr
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
niebling and thank you for taking my
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:28:48.788 --> 05:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
um do you consider uh wood fuel a
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
renewable energy source
 
05:28:51.440 --> 05:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
renewable energy source
absolutely

05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up mr chairman yes go
 
05:28:55.840 --> 05:28:56.788 align:start position:0%
okay and follow up mr chairman yes go
ahead

05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i i i looking into the thermal rex
 
05:29:03.430 --> 05:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
class 1 and thermal
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
class 2
 
05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
i got to say i was a bit confused about
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
what they meant
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i understand that those wrecks are
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
not equivalent can you explain the
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
difference between class 1 thermal
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
wrecks and class 2 thermal uh class 2
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
biomass wrecks
 
05:29:22.948 --> 05:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
i think you're referring to class 3
 
05:29:26.230 --> 05:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
biomass racks and sorry yeah those are
 
05:29:29.430 --> 05:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
that class 3 recognizing recognizes
 
05:29:32.230 --> 05:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
existing biomass electric generation
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
class 1 thermal represents biomass
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
geothermal and solar thermal
 
05:29:37.280 --> 05:29:40.310 align:start position:0%
geothermal and solar thermal
technologies

05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
but on are are the rex equivalent that's
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking um
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
so when class one was created it was
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
carved out of the pre-existing class one
 
05:29:53.030 --> 05:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
electric obligation
 
05:29:57.590 --> 05:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
so it effectively reduced the utilities
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
class 1 renewable electric purchase
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
obligation by an equivalent percentage
 
05:30:05.830 --> 05:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
it did not add any additional obligation
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
to the on the part of the utilities
 
05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
to purchase anything beyond what was
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
and importantly and i think uh this
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
another very important part of the
 
05:30:20.390 --> 05:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
history of this
 
05:30:23.110 --> 05:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
it was carved out and
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the ceiling price on class 1 thermal
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
wrecks was set at 25
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
so the percentage that was carved out of
 
05:30:34.470 --> 05:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
existing class 1 electric at 55 ceiling
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
price or acp was reduced significantly
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
to 25 the effect of that change of law
 
05:30:44.230 --> 05:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the reasons
 
05:30:46.470 --> 05:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation passed with such
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming bipartisan support was to
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
very significantly reduce the overall
 
05:30:55.030 --> 05:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
compliance cost of the rps
 
05:30:57.430 --> 05:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
simultaneously expanding its scope to
 
05:30:59.830 --> 05:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
include heat energy in the state which
 
05:30:59.840 --> 05:31:00.708 align:start position:0%
include heat energy in the state which
is

05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:31:03.030 --> 05:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
in fact we consume more heat energy in
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire than we do electric energy
 
05:31:06.638 --> 05:31:07.830 align:start position:0%
new hampshire than we do electric energy
so

05:31:07.830 --> 05:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
another important piece of history that
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think that the committee needs to be
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for mr needling
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
i will call on the next speaker who is
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
michael o'leary a member of the public
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
to represent him representing himself mr
 
05:31:28.718 --> 05:31:32.628 align:start position:0%
to represent him representing himself mr
o'leary

05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes you have the floor for two minutes
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chairman bose honorable
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
my name is michael o'leary i am the
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
asset manager of bridgewater power
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
company 15 megawatt biomass fire
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
generating station located in
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
bridgewater new hampshire
 
05:31:52.390 --> 05:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
i come before the committee today
 
05:31:55.190 --> 05:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to 213 and strongly encourage
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote the bill in
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
expediental legislate
 
05:32:01.270 --> 05:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
title of the bill states the bill
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
eliminates useful thermal energy portion
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the rps
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
the bill goes beyond that to also
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate biomass and thus our facility
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
entirely from the rps by deleting
 
05:32:13.440 --> 05:32:14.628 align:start position:0%
entirely from the rps by deleting
biomass

05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
biomass
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
from eligibility in class 3.
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
i have testified many times before the
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee and i'll attempt to be concise
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
in recapping some of the history of new
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire small biomass plants for the
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
benefit of the new committee members and
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
to refresh the memory of those of you
 
05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
who have been here for many many years
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
while i only represent bridgewater
 
05:32:36.868 --> 05:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
virtually all these facts pertain to the
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
other small biomass facilities in the
 
05:32:39.040 --> 05:32:40.390 align:start position:0%
other small biomass facilities in the
state

05:32:40.390 --> 05:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:32:42.390 --> 05:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
biomass power plants are a critical
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
partner with the timber industry for the
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
management of new hampshire's forests as
 
05:32:48.470 --> 05:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
we are the primary market for low-grade
 
05:32:48.480 --> 05:32:49.510 align:start position:0%
we are the primary market for low-grade
wood

05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
wood
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
by a way of background
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
biomass plants were built in the late
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
1980s and had 20-year contracts to power
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
the contracts were based on the
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
projections of utility powerful power
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
costs forecast into the future by new
 
05:33:07.510 --> 05:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's regulated utilities and they
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
were approved by the new hampshire
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
contrary to the sponsors
 
05:33:13.120 --> 05:33:14.628 align:start position:0%
contrary to the sponsors
characterization

05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
characterization
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
these contracts were not a carve out for
 
05:33:20.788 --> 05:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
biomass nor were they subsidies in fact
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
any form of energy that met a certain
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
efficiency or used a renewable resource
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
could qualify
 
05:33:31.030 --> 05:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
hence in many parts of the country these
 
05:33:33.030 --> 05:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
types of contracts were given to
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
facilities firing fuels
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
other like natural gas and coal
 
05:33:39.990 --> 05:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
in 2007
 
05:33:41.670 --> 05:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire passed the bipartisan
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard law
 
05:33:47.510 --> 05:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
15 seconds and we are dependent on this
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
for our operation
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
these wrecks are critical to our supply
 
05:33:55.030 --> 05:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
the pro the sponsor also discussed the
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
purchase requirements of class 3
 
05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
if plants weren't operating this is an
 
05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
unwarranted concern because under
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
current law the public utilities
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
commission can adjust
 
05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
the purchase requirement
 
05:34:13.190 --> 05:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
any in any given year and has done so
 
05:34:15.910 --> 05:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
many many times
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'd be happy to answer any
 
05:34:17.920 --> 05:34:19.190 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'd be happy to answer any
questions

05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much we appreciate

uh representative samsich did you have a
 
05:34:28.948 --> 05:34:28.958 align:start position:0%
question or is your hand left over from
 
05:34:30.628 --> 05:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
last time
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
no mr chairman i did have a question
 
05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%

05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
okay so uh thank you mr o'leary for
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
coming to testify
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh can you give us a little bit of a an
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
overview of the economic impact that the
 
05:34:45.830 --> 05:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
biomass plants have here in new
 
05:34:45.840 --> 05:34:47.670 align:start position:0%
biomass plants have here in new
hampshire

05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
i can i mean there's been multiple
 
05:34:49.840 --> 05:34:51.350 align:start position:0%
i can i mean there's been multiple
studies

05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
studies
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
done conducted by
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university conducted by
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire
 
05:35:01.548 --> 05:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
um there's the direct benefit from is
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
254 million dollars was the last one i
 
05:35:06.070 --> 05:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
jason stock from timberland owners
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
association will also speak to this in
 
05:35:11.830 --> 05:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
the case of bridgewater alone
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
since since our since our inception
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
we've purchased more than 160 million
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
dollars of wood fiber from the state of
 
05:35:22.548 --> 05:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we've paid out more than
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
55 million dollars in direct wages and
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
benefits to our employees that have
 
05:35:29.910 --> 05:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
stayed right here in the state of new
 
05:35:29.920 --> 05:35:30.868 align:start position:0%

employees owns their own home
 
05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
these are good jobs that would be lost
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
if our facility was closed and many of
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
them have been closed and are trying
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
desperately to reopen
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%

critical
 
05:40:10.868 --> 05:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
that we reduce our reliance on fossil
 
05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
fuels for generating electricity today
 
05:40:15.430 --> 05:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's current rps law
 
05:40:16.948 --> 05:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
encourages new hampshire to transition
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
away from fossil fuel generated
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
electricity to renewable sources
 
05:40:22.310 --> 05:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
electricity by requiring utilities to
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
produce a certain percentage of power
 
05:40:25.990 --> 05:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
from renewables each year
 
05:40:27.430 --> 05:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
the rps has helped new hampshire begin
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
making progress on transitioning to
 
05:40:28.958 --> 05:40:30.070 align:start position:0%
making progress on transitioning to

05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
renewables
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
it has also contributed to the
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
development of renewable energy industry
 
05:40:34.470 --> 05:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
hp 213 is a massive step in the wrong
 
05:40:36.638 --> 05:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
hp 213 is a massive step in the wrong
direction

05:40:37.670 --> 05:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
all of new hampshire's neighbors have
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
passed laws mandating rps targets that
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
are more ambitious than new hampshires
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
and these targets are continually
 
05:40:44.400 --> 05:40:45.830 align:start position:0%
and these targets are continually
increasing

05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
however hp 213
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
would move in the opposite direction and
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
severely water down new hampshire's
 
05:40:53.350 --> 05:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
already limited rps target
 
05:40:55.270 --> 05:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
hb213 would cause new hampshire to lose
 
05:40:56.868 --> 05:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
out on the development of the renewable
 
05:40:58.150 --> 05:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
energy industry
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
while our neighbors reap the benefits
 
05:41:02.310 --> 05:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
the current rps has considerable
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
economic benefit for new hampshire
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
the rps supports increased investments
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
and renewables in new hampshire and
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
brings local renewable energy jobs to
 
05:41:11.190 --> 05:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
as you begin as you begin exploring the
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
possibility of citing offshore wind in
 
05:41:16.310 --> 05:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
the gulf of maine
 
05:41:18.708 --> 05:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
decreasing new hampshire's rps
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
requirements risks shifting offshore
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
wind investments in the gulf of maine to
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
maine and massachusetts
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
decreasing new hampshire's rps also
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
risks encouraging solar developers to
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
invest in other states with higher rps
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
targets instead of new hampshire
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
in conclusion new hampshire's current
 
05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
rps is necessary to protect public
 
05:41:39.030 --> 05:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
health and address climate change and is
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
good for the economy of new hampshire
 
05:41:43.590 --> 05:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
clf urges the committee to reject h.b
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%

05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
what the impact of the uh well um
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
by managing our forests are we not um
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
minimizing the impact of invasive

species to our climate change
 
05:42:19.350 --> 05:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case uh would this
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill passes would be we be
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
less effective in managing our forest
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
resources in your opinion
 
05:42:27.190 --> 05:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely thank you for the
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
you know it's without a doubt that
 
05:42:31.990 --> 05:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
climate change is affecting the health
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
of our forests i mean the longer we wait
 
05:42:35.990 --> 05:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
to address climate change
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know the greater the impact is going
 
05:42:40.628 --> 05:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
to be to our forest health and so
 
05:42:42.548 --> 05:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
you know were we to weaken this you know
 
05:42:44.150 --> 05:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
is going to make it that much more
 
05:42:46.948 --> 05:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
difficult to address the health impacts
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
to our forests from climate change so
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:42:52.470 --> 05:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
a step in the wrong direction
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
and yeah you know answer your question
 
05:42:55.990 --> 05:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes i think it will
 
05:42:56.000 --> 05:42:57.270 align:start position:0%
yes i think it will
um

05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:58.788 --> 05:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
you know negatively impact our forest
 
05:42:58.798 --> 05:42:59.910 align:start position:0%
you know negatively impact our forest
health

05:42:59.910 --> 05:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:43:02.788 --> 05:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer representative
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
pimentel recognized for a question
 
05:43:09.110 --> 05:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
05:43:14.070 --> 05:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
the reduction in rps in new hampshire
 
05:43:16.548 --> 05:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
was a detriment to
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh the location of commercial power
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
plants in this
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
state uh renewable power plants in the
 
05:43:26.548 --> 05:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
state could you explain how that works
 
05:43:29.830 --> 05:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure um i mean you know the rps as
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative harrington acknowledged
 
05:43:34.150 --> 05:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know essentially works as a subsidy
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know so by by having that sort of
 
05:43:37.510 --> 05:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
subsidy in place
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
um you know you encourage investments
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
and renewables whether solar wind
 
05:43:44.470 --> 05:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
so you know already in our you know our
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
neighbors you know you're seeing a lot
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
of investments in maine massachusetts
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
vermont you know in solar
 
05:43:54.230 --> 05:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
and wind and you know the rps um
 
05:43:55.510 --> 05:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
helps encourage
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
these industries you know when their
 
05:43:57.600 --> 05:43:58.708 align:start position:0%
these industries you know when their
inception

05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
inception
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know and already you're kind of
 
05:44:01.830 --> 05:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
seeing um
 
05:44:03.590 --> 05:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know where these industries are cost
 
05:44:05.190 --> 05:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
competitive with other
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
energy sources but you know especially
 
05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
what at the beginning of the um the
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
growth of these industries you know that
 
05:44:11.910 --> 05:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
subsidy really helps their development
 
05:44:13.590 --> 05:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
without that subsidy
 
05:44:13.600 --> 05:44:14.548 align:start position:0%
without that subsidy
um

05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:15.670 --> 05:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's basically just going to
 
05:44:15.680 --> 05:44:17.190 align:start position:0%
you know it's basically just going to
encourage

05:44:17.190 --> 05:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know investors and renewables to
 
05:44:24.390 --> 05:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.400 --> 05:44:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:44:25.350 --> 05:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that answer
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions for the
 
05:44:29.760 --> 05:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions for the
speaker

05:44:31.030 --> 05:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:44:34.390 --> 05:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
i will call on the next speaker
 
05:44:34.400 --> 05:44:36.948 align:start position:0%
i will call on the next speaker
is

05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
mr tom
 
05:44:39.360 --> 05:44:41.190 align:start position:0%
mr tom
christensen

05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
christensen
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
a member of the public who is speaking
 
05:44:45.750 --> 05:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
for himself mr christensen you have the
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
floor for two minutes thank you mr
 
05:44:50.948 --> 05:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you committee members
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a tree farmer my wife and i are
 
05:44:54.628 --> 05:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
managing the tree found them in line bro
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire 900 acres
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of ground zero i'll give
 
05:45:02.230 --> 05:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
you an example two years ago
 
05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
we had hybrid brothers come and do a
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
timber harvest
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
and about
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of the wood was low-grade wood
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
and they're going to the power plants
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
and about
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
60 percent of the wood was cut and then
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
joey hardwick says i got no place to
 
05:45:24.470 --> 05:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
send my wood
 
05:45:26.788 --> 05:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
the the power plants are full up and
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
they're shutting down
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i just called them this year and i
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
said is the market getting any better it
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
isn't getting any better the landowners
 
05:45:38.948 --> 05:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
have no option to get rid of their
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood and a low-grade wood is a
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
vast majority of our wood so what are
 
05:45:46.230 --> 05:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
they going to do all you can get is
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to high-grade your
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
wood lot okay
 
05:45:52.708 --> 05:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
forget about electric rates it's sound
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
government policy to have a place where
 
05:45:58.470 --> 05:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
where low-grade wood the quality of our
 
05:46:00.548 --> 05:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
forest is enhanced
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
by getting a market for this low-grade
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
wood and and especially
 
05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
local wood
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
all the jobs that are created i don't
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
care about what the electric rate is but
 
05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
if you take a californian example where
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
they had poor forest management
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
what happened to california last year
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
they sent billions of dollars fighting
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
massive fires okay
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
we haven't got that point but this is
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to destroy
 
05:46:28.160 --> 05:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
this is going to destroy
these

05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
landowners to to manage their forest
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
the state government should be
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
encouraging good forest management not
 
05:46:38.470 --> 05:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
things to destroy it
 
05:46:40.470 --> 05:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'd entertain your
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions and uh i find i hope you find
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate
 
05:46:48.628 --> 05:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for mr christensen
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.470 --> 05:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
christensen for um coming to testify
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
can you tell us a little bit about how
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
long you've been in this business and
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
managing your forest
 
05:47:10.150 --> 05:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
us we bought our first parcel of
 
05:47:15.670 --> 05:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:17.670 --> 05:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
and we've grown to over a thousand acres
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
of announce cut back to 900 acres
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:47:23.680 --> 05:47:24.548 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
uh

05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions for mr
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
christensen i'll call on the next
 
05:47:28.160 --> 05:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
christensen i'll call on the next
question

05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
i got a question
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me i didn't see that i thought
 
05:47:33.750 --> 05:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
you left your hand up from the last
 
05:47:37.510 --> 05:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
question you had representative pimentel
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here to uh
 
05:47:42.000 --> 05:47:43.830 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here to uh
testify

05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
testify
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
i guess i have a question and and you
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:47:49.190 --> 05:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
skirted on this a little bit
 
05:47:50.708 --> 05:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:47:53.350 --> 05:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
if if we don't have this
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
this subsidy which
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
adds value to
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh sixty percent of the wood harvested
 
05:48:01.040 --> 05:48:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh sixty percent of the wood harvested
essentially

05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
um it's gonna it has no market what is
 
05:48:08.868 --> 05:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
the implications to that for the rope
 
05:48:11.670 --> 05:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the local rate payer
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
how how is
 
05:48:15.750 --> 05:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
that affecting them
 
05:48:15.760 --> 05:48:16.628 align:start position:0%
that affecting them
well

05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:48:19.030 --> 05:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of markets for the
 
05:48:21.990 --> 05:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
wood low grade wood the rate payer
 
05:48:24.150 --> 05:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
may have a lower electric rate but
 
05:48:25.750 --> 05:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a heck of a lot
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
higher rate and government services to
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
example to to prevent forest fires
 
05:48:34.390 --> 05:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
to manage the wood that you have to
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
aside from electric rates
 
05:48:38.470 --> 05:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
the money's going to have to come from
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
somewheres to manage the forest
 
05:48:43.830 --> 05:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the way it works now it's good
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
because it it hits it right at the
 
05:48:45.840 --> 05:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
because it it hits it right at the
beginning

05:48:47.270 --> 05:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
if we're going to wait till
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
we get a disaster
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's aside from the rate
 
05:48:53.360 --> 05:48:54.230 align:start position:0%
uh that's aside from the rate
the

05:48:54.230 --> 05:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to pay anyways
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay more
 
05:49:01.590 --> 05:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
california is a good example
 
05:49:01.600 --> 05:49:06.230 align:start position:0%
california is a good example
okay

05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:06.240 --> 05:49:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:07.120 --> 05:49:08.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:08.080 --> 05:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
so
uh

05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:12.708 --> 05:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
the the additional cost i i guess uh the
 
05:49:15.190 --> 05:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
other question i'm wondering is
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
not not only are we going to pay
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
in some other way to to deal with the
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:49:24.548 --> 05:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
the uh use of the force but
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
if we're coming in afterwards
 
05:49:27.200 --> 05:49:29.030 align:start position:0%
if we're coming in afterwards
um

05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:31.830 --> 05:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
what is is there any value left in what
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
what's been
 
05:49:36.070 --> 05:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh left in the forest
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
well if we have forest fires you go down
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
to zero value plus you spend all the
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
money to fight the fires and the forest
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
land owners left with nothing i'd hate
 
05:49:47.430 --> 05:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
to see all the forest land owners in
 
05:49:47.440 --> 05:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
to see all the forest land owners in
california

05:49:48.470 --> 05:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
california
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
that have gone out of business because
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
the the land was
 
05:49:54.868 --> 05:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
to get a permit in california is so
 
05:49:57.670 --> 05:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
expensive they they basically
 
05:49:57.680 --> 05:49:58.548 align:start position:0%
expensive they they basically
are

05:49:58.548 --> 05:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:50:01.030 --> 05:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
not letting anybody work in the woods
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that they're just
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
the landowners are giving up okay
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
so then
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
what happens you get the big disaster
 
05:50:11.350 --> 05:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
then the tax payers got to pay for the
 
05:50:11.360 --> 05:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
then the tax payers got to pay for the
disaster

05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative mcgee
 
05:50:19.350 --> 05:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
05:50:21.270 --> 05:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
christensen for coming in to speak with
 
05:50:24.310 --> 05:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
us today
 
05:50:25.830 --> 05:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
um it
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i'm hearing you say i
 
05:50:29.670 --> 05:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
guess what i'm what i want to understand
 
05:50:29.680 --> 05:50:30.470 align:start position:0%
guess what i'm what i want to understand
is

05:50:30.470 --> 05:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
um i am hearing testimony that what
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to do is remove
 
05:50:35.360 --> 05:50:36.628 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to do is remove
subsidies

05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
05:50:38.310 --> 05:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
because people are smart enough to
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
choose their right energy sources but
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing you say is that the
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
incentives that the state government was
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
putting in place were actually incenting
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
behavior that is desirable
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
as well as for
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh the type of state that we are which
 
05:51:00.070 --> 05:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
is that we have all this forest that we
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't otherwise be able to pay to
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
maintain so
 
05:51:04.948 --> 05:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you could speak to that because
 
05:51:07.270 --> 05:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
i've heard you allude to that but i
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
think that that's a really important
 
05:51:10.948 --> 05:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
point to make here today before very
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
important point for example
 
05:51:15.750 --> 05:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
our our woods roads are all gated we
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
don't allow cars under the tree found
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
but we have hikers come here every day
 
05:51:22.708 --> 05:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
to enjoy the forest
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
they love the forest we try to do a good
 
05:51:27.830 --> 05:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
job we try to find markets for a
 
05:51:30.310 --> 05:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood which is becoming almost
 
05:51:30.320 --> 05:51:32.230 align:start position:0%
low-grade wood which is becoming almost
impossible

05:51:32.230 --> 05:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
05:51:32.240 --> 05:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
impossible
and

05:51:33.830 --> 05:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
it makes it difficult for the forest
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
landowner to maintain their forest if we
 
05:51:40.470 --> 05:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
don't if we don't have a market for a
 
05:51:42.628 --> 05:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
low grade wood
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
and it's good government policy
 
05:51:47.510 --> 05:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we were going to destroy by
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:52.628 --> 05:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative thomas

representative thomas is recognized for
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
a question
 
05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr sherman thank you uh mr
 
05:52:03.750 --> 05:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
richardson for taking my question
 
05:52:03.760 --> 05:52:04.868 align:start position:0%
richardson for taking my question
um

05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
i i tend to agree with you on on the
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
health of the frs but my question is
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the subsidies
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
that are currently being paid to the
 
05:52:16.230 --> 05:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
biomass plants are
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
pretty much paid for by
 
05:52:20.708 --> 05:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
only certain ratepayers because of the
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
location that that they're in so
 
05:52:22.798 --> 05:52:23.830 align:start position:0%
location that that they're in so
therefore

05:52:23.830 --> 05:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
only certain ratepayers are paying these
 
05:52:25.840 --> 05:52:26.948 align:start position:0%
only certain ratepayers are paying these
subsidies

05:52:26.948 --> 05:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh but the farmers can benefit everyone
 
05:52:29.760 --> 05:52:30.788 align:start position:0%
uh but the farmers can benefit everyone
uh

05:52:30.788 --> 05:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:52:32.470 --> 05:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be a lot better
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
and add more value to everybody in the
 
05:52:37.910 --> 05:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
state if the methodology for helping to
 
05:52:41.030 --> 05:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
keep the forest healthy were paid for by
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state through some
 
05:52:45.110 --> 05:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
other means other than only certain a
 
05:52:47.190 --> 05:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
certain rate class maybe through our
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
maybe to a state budget or some other
 
05:52:50.548 --> 05:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
method where
 
05:52:52.150 --> 05:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
everybody contributes instead of just a
 
05:52:52.160 --> 05:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
everybody contributes instead of just a
few

05:52:53.750 --> 05:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
few
 
05:52:55.990 --> 05:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
possibly but you got to work it out you
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
can't just eliminate one
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
sausage source of support and just hope
 
05:53:02.948 --> 05:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
that something is going to come in in
 
05:53:08.730 --> 05:53:08.740 align:start position:0%

representative presley's recognized for
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you mr chairman and
 
05:53:22.708 --> 05:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr christensen for your
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
testimony i have a simple question i
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can answer this but
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
why can't uh power company afford to
 
05:53:30.470 --> 05:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
burn the low grade wood without the
 
05:53:33.270 --> 05:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
subsidies do you know why what the
 
05:53:35.990 --> 05:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
technical reasons are or
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
i am i'm just a landowner
 
05:53:41.830 --> 05:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
i sell wood low grade good quality wood
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what the economics
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
beyond that but i do know that that
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
currently we have good forest policy and
 
05:53:53.350 --> 05:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's being degraded by the eliminating
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.708 --> 05:53:58.718 align:start position:0%

thank you okay thank you
 
05:54:04.150 --> 05:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
the price of the wood to take it out for
 
05:54:06.470 --> 05:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
out of the north country and i have two
 
05:54:08.310 --> 05:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
huge huge larger companies that surround
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
my place
 
05:54:12.390 --> 05:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh they wouldn't log this spring and it
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
looks like an atomic
 
05:54:14.240 --> 05:54:14.948 align:start position:0%
looks like an atomic
and

05:54:14.948 --> 05:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
the consequence of this
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be quick uh kids when they
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
can't in the summer they ended up having
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
a 50 acre fire
 
05:54:22.400 --> 05:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
a 50 acre fire
because

05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
the price they were getting for the low
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
grade wood went from a thousand dollars
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
where trucks go down to 25 of charcoal
 
05:54:33.510 --> 05:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
now these guys can't do the labor the
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
gas and everything else to get this wood
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
out below great wood so we are seeing
 
05:54:39.190 --> 05:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
major problems in the last year since a
 
05:54:41.590 --> 05:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
lot of these biomass plates have closed
 
05:54:43.990 --> 05:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what the answer is i
 
05:54:46.390 --> 05:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
agree with um
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative harrington i mean we just
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
can't put it on the back of the rate
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
page but something has to be addressed
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
with these problems maybe not in our
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee but it is a growing problem
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
mr christensen saw it's impossible for
 
05:54:59.670 --> 05:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
these guys to block these places right
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
now they're just taking the good within
 
05:55:02.788 --> 05:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
the 60 percent it just looks like a bomb
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
went off it's laying everywhere take a
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
walk up the north country it's a mess in
 
05:55:09.270 --> 05:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
the last year so
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:15.270 --> 05:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative murder
 
05:55:17.110 --> 05:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative jackie kelly pitts is
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
my question is um does anybody we talk
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
about subsidies and rates
 
05:55:30.788 --> 05:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
does anybody know what this particular
 
05:55:30.798 --> 05:55:32.548 align:start position:0%
does anybody know what this particular
portion

05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
portion
 
05:55:32.558 --> 05:55:34.868 align:start position:0%
portion
of

05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
the subsidy
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
return back if we if we eliminate it to
 
05:55:42.948 --> 05:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
the customer's bill
 
05:55:44.948 --> 05:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
is it pennies a day
 
05:55:46.628 --> 05:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
pennies a month
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
ten dollars a year
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
do we know or do we have that figure
 
05:55:50.718 --> 05:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
do we know or do we have that figure
anywhere

05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
and who are you asking that question of
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm asking that question of the last
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
speaker or anybody else who might want
 
05:56:05.190 --> 05:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
to take a stab at it we keep talking
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
about this lowering the rates
 
05:56:09.670 --> 05:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
but by how much
 
05:56:11.110 --> 05:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not like you're going to
 
05:56:13.830 --> 05:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
take a electric bill and cut it in half
 
05:56:16.230 --> 05:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
so i'd really like to know does anybody
 
05:56:18.470 --> 05:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:56:21.030 --> 05:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
and if not i would like to ask the
 
05:56:23.350 --> 05:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
chairman if there's a way that he could
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
get that information
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:29.910 --> 05:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think uh chris goglin from
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
des is still here with us maybe he could
 
05:56:36.310 --> 05:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:40.070 --> 05:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what
 
05:56:49.910 --> 05:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:51.430 --> 05:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
if she could find that information for
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
us how would that be
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:56:54.400 --> 05:56:56.150 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
okay

05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:56:57.750 --> 05:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
well we're
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh running up against our
 
05:57:03.190 --> 05:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
the end of our hour for the public
 
05:57:05.030 --> 05:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill
 
05:57:07.590 --> 05:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the next bill is a bill that a lot
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
of people are extremely interested in so
 
05:57:14.390 --> 05:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm reluctant to start that hearing late
 
05:57:18.310 --> 05:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to recess this hearing
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing on hb 213
 
05:57:23.830 --> 05:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
and we will resume this hearing
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
at a future date
 
05:57:27.190 --> 05:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly what that date will
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
be probably february 22nd because it has
 
05:57:31.910 --> 05:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be noticed in the calendar there has
 
05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be a time certain for the
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
resuming of a recessed hearing
 
05:57:39.360 --> 05:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
resuming of a recessed hearing
so

05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:43.830 --> 05:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
those of you who have not yet testified
 
05:57:45.590 --> 05:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
who want to testify
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
i urge you to keep your eye on the
 
05:57:47.520 --> 05:57:48.548 align:start position:0%
i urge you to keep your eye on the
calendar

05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that you can return with us
 
05:57:55.990 --> 05:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
when we resume
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb 213 but for now
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
and that will give us an opportunity
 
05:58:07.440 --> 05:58:10.628 align:start position:0%
and that will give us an opportunity
to

05:58:10.628 --> 05:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:16.150 --> 05:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have 26 people who have signed up to
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill
 
05:58:23.910 --> 05:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
we can uh
 
05:58:25.750 --> 05:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
continue this public hearing until five
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
o'clock so that gives us two hours to
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
discuss this bill
 
05:58:30.120 --> 05:58:31.510 align:start position:0%
discuss this bill

05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
but before i do that
 
05:58:42.708 --> 05:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
i have to turn the
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing over to the vice chairman
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
because he's the prime sponsor of the
 
05:58:47.830 --> 05:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill i can't
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%

05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
i guess he called a point of order i was
 
05:59:23.670 --> 05:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could get the uh blue
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh sheet tabulations for the last spell
 
05:59:28.470 --> 05:59:28.480 align:start position:0%

06:01:21.830 --> 06:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
a bill passed in the senate sb 286 the
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill was admitted to the house and
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
introduced some language into the
 
06:01:25.920 --> 06:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
introduced some language into the
statute

06:01:27.030 --> 06:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:01:29.910 --> 06:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
that has proved to be a stumbling block
 
06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
for the development of rules to
 
06:01:32.480 --> 06:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
for the development of rules to
implement

06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
implement
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
community aggregation
 
06:01:40.070 --> 06:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
community aggregation is
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
the pulling together of electricity
 
06:01:45.030 --> 06:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
customers to give them group buying
 
06:01:45.040 --> 06:01:46.708 align:start position:0%
customers to give them group buying
power

06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
power
 
06:01:48.868 --> 06:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
the overall intent of that is to lower
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity it's a good
 
06:01:50.638 --> 06:01:52.070 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity it's a good
concept

06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
concept
 
06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's a concept that ought to work and
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's a concept that a lot of people
 
06:02:00.150 --> 06:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
favor a lot of people are interested in
 
06:02:01.910 --> 06:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
but when the bill was
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
modified in 2019
 
06:02:07.510 --> 06:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
some additional
 
06:02:09.510 --> 06:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
provisions were added
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
to try to include something called
 
06:02:14.310 --> 06:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
community power
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
community power is a set of services
 
06:02:20.310 --> 06:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
that could be provided
 
06:02:21.510 --> 06:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
by a
 
06:02:21.520 --> 06:02:22.708 align:start position:0%
by a
utility

06:02:22.708 --> 06:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
utility
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
such as demand response management
 
06:02:26.868 --> 06:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency programs metering load
 
06:02:28.948 --> 06:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
settlement billing customer service et
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera
 
06:02:34.470 --> 06:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
but community power is uh
 
06:02:37.830 --> 06:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
as desirable as as those services may be
 
06:02:40.070 --> 06:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
06:02:41.350 --> 06:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
critical to
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
creating community aggregation and as a
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
result they've resulted in a
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
an impasse
 
06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
in developing rules for the
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
so sp i mean hp 315
 
06:03:05.270 --> 06:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
we're introducing to try to simplify
 
06:03:08.910 --> 06:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
h rsa 55-e
 
06:03:08.920 --> 06:03:10.548 align:start position:0%
h rsa 55-e
53-e

06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
53-e
 
06:03:11.750 --> 06:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:03:14.948 --> 06:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
community aggregation can actually be
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:22.708 --> 06:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
forward i had intended uh this today to
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
introduce an amendment because there
 
06:03:25.750 --> 06:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
were several
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill as originally
 
06:03:30.470 --> 06:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
drafted that turned out to be uh less
 
06:03:32.708 --> 06:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
than ideal so i had intended to
 
06:03:36.470 --> 06:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:38.230 --> 06:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
but i submitted the amendment language
 
06:03:40.948 --> 06:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
to ols yesterday
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
in the morning and when i got back the
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
amendment in the afternoon
 
06:03:47.190 --> 06:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
they had inadvertently
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
missed a couple of sections because it
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
was a it was a space in the word
 
06:03:51.520 --> 06:03:52.628 align:start position:0%
was a it was a space in the word
document

06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
document
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
and when they got to that space they
 
06:03:55.750 --> 06:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
thought that was the end of the
 
06:03:57.350 --> 06:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendment language
 
06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
but there was actually a couple of pages
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
after that that they didn't see so as a
 
06:04:05.510 --> 06:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
result i do not have the amendment
 
06:04:05.520 --> 06:04:07.590 align:start position:0%
result i do not have the amendment
drafted

06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
correctly that i can introduce to the
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
but i think what's more important for
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
today's session because we have 26
 
06:04:20.628 --> 06:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
speakers lined up is to hear just
 
06:04:23.430 --> 06:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what the issues are that people
 
06:04:25.430 --> 06:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
have with this bill
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who are in
 
06:04:28.948 --> 06:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
support of it but there are also a lot
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
of people who are opposed to it
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
just a little while ago
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
i received a letter
 
06:04:37.920 --> 06:04:39.670 align:start position:0%
i received a letter
from

06:04:39.670 --> 06:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:04:39.680 --> 06:04:41.030 align:start position:0%
from
the

06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:44.230 --> 06:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
06:04:46.470 --> 06:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
and that letter
 
06:04:51.970 --> 06:04:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:51.980 --> 06:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:04:55.190 --> 06:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
that letter basically says that the
 
06:04:59.910 --> 06:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
governor thinks that going forward with
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
community aggregation is an important uh
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
energy policy for the state he wants to
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
see it succeed and so he wants us to do
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:16.230 --> 06:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
make changes in the existing law that
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
will allow community aggregation to be
 
06:05:19.120 --> 06:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
will allow community aggregation to be
successful

06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:24.868 --> 06:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that a lot of people
 
06:05:24.878 --> 06:05:25.750 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that a lot of people
think

06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:05:27.750 --> 06:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
is important and therefore we have to
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
get it right
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure
 
06:05:31.040 --> 06:05:32.070 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure
that

06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:36.628 --> 06:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot of opposition to
 
06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
the bill because some people think that
 
06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
it shuts down community aggregation
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:52.230 --> 06:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
15 seconds our interpretation is that it
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
does not shut down community aggregation
 
06:05:57.270 --> 06:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
it may separate community aggregation
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
from community power which is
 
06:05:59.360 --> 06:06:00.310 align:start position:0%
from community power which is
uh

06:06:00.310 --> 06:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:06:03.350 --> 06:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
a real an unrelated set of services but
 
06:06:05.030 --> 06:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
the two don't need to go together you
 
06:06:07.750 --> 06:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
can do community aggregation without
 
06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
doing community power and you can do
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
community power without doing
 
06:06:11.920 --> 06:06:13.110 align:start position:0%
community power without doing
aggregation

06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
06:06:13.120 --> 06:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
aggregation
so

06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:16.070 --> 06:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're kind of two separate
 
06:06:17.670 --> 06:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh concepts
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they don't need to be lumped
 
06:06:19.200 --> 06:06:20.310 align:start position:0%
and they don't need to be lumped
together

06:06:20.310 --> 06:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:06:21.910 --> 06:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people seem to think that
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
if you do
 
06:06:25.590 --> 06:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
put them together
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
the end result is better
 
06:06:27.600 --> 06:06:28.310 align:start position:0%
the end result is better
but

06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
06:06:31.390 --> 06:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
experience with rsa
 
06:06:34.708 --> 06:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
53-e shows that it is not necessarily
 
06:06:34.718 --> 06:06:37.270 align:start position:0%
53-e shows that it is not necessarily
better

06:06:37.270 --> 06:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to read the governor's
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
letter now that i have a copy in front
 
06:06:42.788 --> 06:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
of me that i can read
 
06:06:44.548 --> 06:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
it says dear chairman rose and members
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the sde committee committee community
 
06:06:48.628 --> 06:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
aggregation provides a unique
 
06:06:50.708 --> 06:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for municipalities to lower
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
energy costs and to provide options for
 
06:06:54.548 --> 06:06:54.558 align:start position:0%
their citizens
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
in 2019 i signed senate bill 286 into
 
06:06:59.430 --> 06:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
law with the hope that enhancing
 
06:07:01.110 --> 06:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
community aggregation would lead to
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
increased local control and lower
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
electric bills for rate payers
 
06:07:07.270 --> 06:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
especially for seniors and those of
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
lower incomes
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unintended unanticipated
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
complications and technical
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
uncertainties have kept this policy
 
06:07:16.470 --> 06:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
change from moving forward as quickly as
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
it should these difficulties threaten to
 
06:07:21.350 --> 06:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
bog down the implementation of policy
 
06:07:23.350 --> 06:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
changes to community aggregation for a
 
06:07:24.708 --> 06:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
long time to come
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
i urge you to use house bill 315 as of
 
06:07:29.750 --> 06:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
ended to clarify uncertainties remove
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
barriers to compromise and to bring our
 
06:07:36.150 --> 06:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.350 --> 06:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
to bring
 
06:07:39.670 --> 06:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
to our community swift access rather to
 
06:07:41.910 --> 06:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
these policy changes
 
06:07:43.510 --> 06:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
the key for the long-term success of
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
community aggregation
 
06:07:47.510 --> 06:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
will be the stakeholders engaging in
 
06:07:49.430 --> 06:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
constructive dialogue to reach
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
achievable policy goals the worst result
 
06:07:54.470 --> 06:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be to never advance community
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
aggregation because of technical
 
06:07:58.470 --> 06:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
disputes and overreach
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
together we can ensure that state energy
 
06:08:00.558 --> 06:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
together we can ensure that state energy
policy

06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
policy
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
is sustainable responsible and
 
06:08:07.510 --> 06:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
accountable to our rate payers
 
06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
and that's signed by governor chris
 
06:08:09.440 --> 06:08:14.788 align:start position:0%
and that's signed by governor chris
sununu

06:08:14.788 --> 06:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
so because that i don't have the um
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment to share with you i will
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
point out a couple of things that uh the
 
06:08:26.628 --> 06:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
amendment will do
 
06:08:29.430 --> 06:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
one thing is it implements a purchase of
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
receivables program
 
06:08:33.430 --> 06:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
current law doesn't include a
 
06:08:35.910 --> 06:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
por so-called por
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:08:41.190 --> 06:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
it may not be viewed as necessary but a
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
lot by a lot of people but it's offered
 
06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
as a way to help true community
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
i have some text here that goes through
 
06:08:56.628 --> 06:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
06:08:58.470 --> 06:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
some of the sections of the event that
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
are added by the amendment
 
06:09:02.708 --> 06:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
but i think it would be too long to to
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
go through them without having access to
 
06:09:06.150 --> 06:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself so i'm going to
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
forego doing that
 
06:09:07.920 --> 06:09:09.670 align:start position:0%
forego doing that
and

06:09:09.670 --> 06:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:12.310 --> 06:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
cut off my testimony at this point and
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
encourage people to ask questions and
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
then we can proceed from there so thanks
 
06:09:30.708 --> 06:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.708 --> 06:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:37.430 --> 06:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
i can't hardly hear you
 
06:09:37.440 --> 06:09:38.548 align:start position:0%
i can't hardly hear you
yes

06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's much better
 
06:09:45.110 --> 06:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
oh representative you're recognized for
 
06:09:49.430 --> 06:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
a question go ahead thank you uh and
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you representative both taking my
 
06:09:50.798 --> 06:09:51.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative both taking my
question

06:09:51.750 --> 06:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
it seems as if we've got a situation
 
06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
here where the lard is presently written
 
06:09:58.390 --> 06:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't work but everyone wants to fix
 
06:10:00.070 --> 06:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
it to make it work including the
 
06:10:00.080 --> 06:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
it to make it work including the
governor

06:10:01.030 --> 06:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
governor
 
06:10:02.948 --> 06:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
what would you recommend he he talked
 
06:10:04.788 --> 06:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
about getting the different parties
 
06:10:07.750 --> 06:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
together going forward to work this out
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
to get a solution that i think everybody
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
wants what would you recommend as a the
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
best method of doing that
 
06:10:16.470 --> 06:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
well i think the first step is this
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing let's hear from everybody
 
06:10:20.230 --> 06:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
let's hear what everybody has to say
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
let's hear what their objections are
 
06:10:25.430 --> 06:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
let's hear what their solutions are
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
from there we can go forward and craft
 
06:10:31.190 --> 06:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
06:10:33.350 --> 06:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
to get the job done now we may not be
 
06:10:35.430 --> 06:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
able to get it done
 
06:10:37.350 --> 06:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
right away i would like to get it done
 
06:10:39.430 --> 06:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
right away if possible but
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
there just may not be enough time
 
06:10:43.750 --> 06:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
if that should be the case we might have
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill and work on it over
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
the summer and the fall to get it right
 
06:10:48.718 --> 06:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
the summer and the fall to get it right
but

06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:10:51.270 --> 06:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
06:10:53.830 --> 06:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not this discussion leads to
 
06:10:55.590 --> 06:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
any kind of consensus
 
06:10:57.430 --> 06:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
we may be able to do something this
 
06:10:59.350 --> 06:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
spring in time for
 
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
this legislature to act on it uh before
 
06:11:03.670 --> 06:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
06:11:05.910 --> 06:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
this first year of the biennium
 
06:11:07.590 --> 06:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
and follow up
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so to be clear on this because i
 
06:11:12.070 --> 06:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
think i was wrong this is not a second
 
06:11:14.390 --> 06:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee bill so what's the date we
 
06:11:17.830 --> 06:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
have to act on this bill
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is not a second committee bill
 
06:11:21.830 --> 06:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're you are correct about that
 
06:11:21.840 --> 06:11:22.788 align:start position:0%
you're you are correct about that
the

06:11:22.788 --> 06:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:11:22.798 --> 06:11:23.910 align:start position:0%
the
uh

06:11:23.910 --> 06:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
house calendar deadline i believe for
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
action on all
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee bills is march 11th
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
so we would have roughly a month
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
to try to get something hammered out and
 
06:11:38.470 --> 06:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
put together
 
06:11:40.230 --> 06:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
06:11:41.670 --> 06:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
by the deadline
 
06:11:48.230 --> 06:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative representative sampson
 
06:11:52.868 --> 06:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
06:11:55.670 --> 06:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
06:11:57.590 --> 06:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative votes for taking my
 
06:11:57.600 --> 06:11:58.548 align:start position:0%
representative votes for taking my
question

06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:11:58.558 --> 06:12:00.548 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:12:00.548 --> 06:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:02.708 --> 06:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
06:12:05.670 --> 06:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
i sympathize actually with
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
the situation of our new hampshire
 
06:12:08.160 --> 06:12:09.830 align:start position:0%
the situation of our new hampshire
utilities

06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
06:12:12.470 --> 06:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
after the
 
06:12:15.750 --> 06:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
deregulation of the uh utility market
 
06:12:17.110 --> 06:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
based on
 
06:12:20.948 --> 06:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh integrated services
 
06:12:23.590 --> 06:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
those those utilities cannot really make
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
money on just transporting electrons
 
06:12:29.110 --> 06:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
anymore so the that leaves them with a
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
couple of options including providing
 
06:12:32.788 --> 06:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
various types of services to their
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
customers on which they can make some uh
 
06:12:35.920 --> 06:12:37.190 align:start position:0%
customers on which they can make some uh
profits

06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
profits
 
06:12:39.430 --> 06:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
however it's also true that there are
 
06:12:41.430 --> 06:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
lots of companies out there that want to
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
compete for those services
 
06:12:45.590 --> 06:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i can see how utilities are trying
 
06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
to protect their turf by saying we don't
 
06:12:50.070 --> 06:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
want all these other companies competing
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
with us on these services
 
06:12:55.270 --> 06:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a dilemma i i see for them
 
06:12:57.430 --> 06:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
but the answer is not to shut off
 
06:12:57.440 --> 06:12:58.868 align:start position:0%
but the answer is not to shut off
competition

06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
competition
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's to figure out a way that uh that
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
competition could be made beneficial for
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
all all residents in new hampshire
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
so i want to kind of follow up on the on
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
the question that was just asked
 
06:13:16.230 --> 06:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
how do you envision the role of the
 
06:13:19.190 --> 06:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
utilities in this community power uh
 
06:13:21.350 --> 06:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
situation where they don't feel
 
06:13:23.350 --> 06:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
threatened on the one hand and on the
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
other hand that residents can have an
 
06:13:25.360 --> 06:13:26.548 align:start position:0%
other hand that residents can have an
opportunity

06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:13:29.430 --> 06:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
to aggregate and bid for services that
 
06:13:33.750 --> 06:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:35.350 --> 06:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
06:13:38.868 --> 06:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
i guess my answer would be to that
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
question that
 
06:13:42.708 --> 06:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
the utilities have been parties
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the informal rulemaking discussions
 
06:13:48.548 --> 06:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
that have been ongoing since the passage
 
06:13:53.110 --> 06:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 286 in 2019
 
06:13:53.120 --> 06:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 286 in 2019
and

06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
amongst the parties there has been broad
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
disagreement about
 
06:13:59.840 --> 06:14:00.708 align:start position:0%
disagreement about
what

06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:14:03.430 --> 06:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the rules should look like and how the
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
behavior of these aggregation
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
entities should
 
06:14:09.120 --> 06:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
entities should
should

06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:14:12.868 --> 06:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
go forward with
 
06:14:16.548 --> 06:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
so the utilities have a stake in
 
06:14:19.910 --> 06:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
approving whatever rules get written to
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
protect their own
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
financial interests
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
they want to prevent for example
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
any kind of activity aggregation
 
06:14:32.310 --> 06:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
activity that could shift costs to
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
non-aggregation rate payers
 
06:14:36.788 --> 06:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
especially if they couldn't recover
 
06:14:39.910 --> 06:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
those costs in their rates so because
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a violation of the takings
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
clause of the constitution so there are
 
06:14:47.430 --> 06:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
there are issues here that the utilities
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh object to because they
 
06:14:53.030 --> 06:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
not only want
 
06:14:55.670 --> 06:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
could it affect their ability to provide
 
06:14:57.190 --> 06:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
services to customers but it could
 
06:14:59.110 --> 06:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
actually cost their existing customers
 
06:15:01.590 --> 06:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
money and they want to avoid that
 
06:15:01.600 --> 06:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
money and they want to avoid that
so

06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:15:04.948 --> 06:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
the parties have to come together and
 
06:15:07.350 --> 06:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to do this
 
06:15:07.360 --> 06:15:10.390 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to do this
without

06:15:10.390 --> 06:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:13.830 --> 06:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
imposing unnecessary financial risks on
 
06:15:17.110 --> 06:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
anybody and it's without shifting costs
 
06:15:19.830 --> 06:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
to anybody else
 
06:15:22.868 --> 06:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up mr chairman
 
06:15:25.510 --> 06:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
06:15:25.520 --> 06:15:26.628 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
okay

06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
so um would you agree with me that
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
considering that this is a um
 
06:15:32.948 --> 06:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
a um an act labeled community power
 
06:15:38.390 --> 06:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
the last thing we want to do is dampen
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
the enthusiasm and engagement of local
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities to try to do
 
06:15:45.270 --> 06:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
something to control their own energy
 
06:15:45.280 --> 06:15:47.910 align:start position:0%
something to control their own energy
costs

06:15:47.910 --> 06:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:50.230 --> 06:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
no i wouldn't agree with you about that
 
06:15:52.390 --> 06:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
because i think the problem here is the
 
06:15:54.230 --> 06:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
conflation of
 
06:15:56.150 --> 06:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
community aggregation and community
 
06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
power the two are two different things
 
06:15:58.878 --> 06:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
power the two are two different things
and

06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go together
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and attempts to
 
06:16:06.628 --> 06:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
make them go together
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
have just
 
06:16:10.470 --> 06:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
muddied the waters with regard to how to
 
06:16:13.350 --> 06:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
make the aggregation piece work
 
06:16:13.360 --> 06:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
make the aggregation piece work
so

06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:19.270 --> 06:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
i think the essence of hp 315 is to try
 
06:16:20.470 --> 06:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
community power from community
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
aggregation and to focus strictly on
 
06:16:28.230 --> 06:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
community aggregation so that that piece
 
06:16:30.470 --> 06:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
can get done because community power can
 
06:16:33.350 --> 06:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
be done independently of aggregation it
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
could also be done in conjunction with
 
06:16:42.390 --> 06:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee you have your
 
06:16:46.390 --> 06:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
hand up for a question
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr vice chairman and thank
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman for taking my question
 
06:16:54.548 --> 06:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
um i am happy to see the governor's
 
06:16:57.670 --> 06:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
letter um that you know supporting local
 
06:16:59.910 --> 06:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
control and also supporting a
 
06:17:01.830 --> 06:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that they're from what i've
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
seen of the
 
06:17:07.270 --> 06:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
copious testimony that we've received
 
06:17:09.670 --> 06:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
from various experts in the
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
community power
 
06:17:14.150 --> 06:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
sector it appears that we have people
 
06:17:15.990 --> 06:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
with great expertise who are very
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
interested in how this moves forward
 
06:17:20.628 --> 06:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire so my question is
 
06:17:23.750 --> 06:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
who was involved in the crafting
 
06:17:23.760 --> 06:17:24.628 align:start position:0%
who was involved in the crafting
of

06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:17:26.628 --> 06:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
the definitions in this bill and its
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendment on
 
06:17:33.190 --> 06:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:33.200 --> 06:17:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:17:34.470 --> 06:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:36.948 --> 06:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure exactly who was involved
 
06:17:39.590 --> 06:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
the utilities uh asked me to file this
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill on their behalf
 
06:17:44.070 --> 06:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh i can't say for sure
 
06:17:46.310 --> 06:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
who the parties were that
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
all three regulated utilities
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.788 --> 06:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
okay so you weren't involved in it you
 
06:17:56.948 --> 06:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
were just it was given to you
 
06:17:56.958 --> 06:17:57.750 align:start position:0%
were just it was given to you
yes

06:17:57.750 --> 06:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:17:57.760 --> 06:17:59.590 align:start position:0%
yes
correct

06:17:59.590 --> 06:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
because i think that that is probably
 
06:18:02.948 --> 06:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing so many people
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
speaking up is that the people who are
 
06:18:06.628 --> 06:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
most affected by this weren't really
 
06:18:08.150 --> 06:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
involved in the crafting of it and i
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
think the governor's letter also sort of
 
06:18:12.390 --> 06:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
indicates that that would
 
06:18:13.910 --> 06:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
that would be the process that would get
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
us where we need to go in terms of who's
 
06:18:18.310 --> 06:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
defining what is needed
 
06:18:20.310 --> 06:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
rather than just one segment of the
 
06:18:20.320 --> 06:18:21.190 align:start position:0%
rather than just one segment of the
industry

06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
industry
 
06:18:23.750 --> 06:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
defining it especially the attributes of
 
06:18:26.070 --> 06:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
another segment of the industry that's
 
06:18:28.390 --> 06:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
how i see it i'm sorry i'm always
 
06:18:29.990 --> 06:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make connections and it just
 
06:18:31.910 --> 06:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
appears to me that the bill is being
 
06:18:34.708 --> 06:18:34.718 align:start position:0%
filed by one competitor versus another
 
06:18:37.190 --> 06:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
set of competitors and that's why
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
06:18:40.470 --> 06:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
maybe not inclusive of all the things it
 
06:18:48.548 --> 06:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:51.430 --> 06:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh next uh with his hand up is
 
06:18:53.350 --> 06:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
represent next with his hands up is
 
06:18:53.360 --> 06:18:54.548 align:start position:0%
represent next with his hands up is
representative

06:18:54.548 --> 06:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:18:54.558 --> 06:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
representative
pimentel

06:18:55.830 --> 06:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
pimentel
 
06:18:55.840 --> 06:18:56.830 align:start position:0%
pimentel
for

06:18:56.830 --> 06:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:18:56.840 --> 06:18:58.628 align:start position:0%
for
question

06:18:58.628 --> 06:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:19:00.948 --> 06:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you chairman
 
06:19:03.430 --> 06:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
votes for taking my questions
 
06:19:06.548 --> 06:19:06.558 align:start position:0%
my question involves timelines
 
06:19:11.270 --> 06:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill was removing barriers to
 
06:19:13.920 --> 06:19:15.750 align:start position:0%
this bill was removing barriers to
compromise

06:19:15.750 --> 06:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
06:19:15.760 --> 06:19:16.628 align:start position:0%
compromise
and

06:19:16.628 --> 06:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:18.788 --> 06:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
i i have a sense that
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is actually putting up barriers
 
06:19:23.430 --> 06:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
preventing compromise
 
06:19:27.270 --> 06:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question on timelines is
 
06:19:27.280 --> 06:19:28.230 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question on timelines is
uh

06:19:28.230 --> 06:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:19:29.990 --> 06:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
one of the you said that you wanted to
 
06:19:32.948 --> 06:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
do this so that we could move forward
 
06:19:34.948 --> 06:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
and i understand that i would like us to
 
06:19:36.310 --> 06:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
06:19:37.830 --> 06:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i guess
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
what are the what is the timeline now
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
06:19:45.430 --> 06:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
just allowing the the parties
 
06:19:48.230 --> 06:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
to continue with their negotiating to
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
find a solution
 
06:19:50.638 --> 06:19:51.990 align:start position:0%
find a solution
and

06:19:51.990 --> 06:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:19:54.150 --> 06:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think the timeline would be
 
06:19:57.030 --> 06:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
if we rush this bill through
 
06:19:58.708 --> 06:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:19:58.718 --> 06:20:00.150 align:start position:0%
um and
essentially

06:20:00.150 --> 06:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:20:00.160 --> 06:20:01.110 align:start position:0%
essentially
uh

06:20:01.110 --> 06:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
here only one
 
06:20:06.470 --> 06:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
have only one side of the um
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
the parties basically write the bill
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that question
 
06:20:15.590 --> 06:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
so the way to answer that question is
 
06:20:15.600 --> 06:20:18.548 align:start position:0%
so the way to answer that question is
this

06:20:18.548 --> 06:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
we know that the process has been
 
06:20:23.590 --> 06:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
stalled at the public utilities
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
commission because they haven't even
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
gotten to formal rulemaking yet the
 
06:20:29.510 --> 06:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
informal rulemaking process
 
06:20:29.520 --> 06:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
informal rulemaking process
was

06:20:30.470 --> 06:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:20:32.948 --> 06:20:32.958 align:start position:0%
taking very very long and
 
06:20:34.830 --> 06:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
not being particularly
 
06:20:38.708 --> 06:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
productive so the utilities decided to
 
06:20:41.510 --> 06:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
put a proposal on the table
 
06:20:45.910 --> 06:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
hb 315 is a proposal it's on the table
 
06:20:47.750 --> 06:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's open for discussion
 
06:20:47.760 --> 06:20:48.548 align:start position:0%
it's open for discussion
so

06:20:48.548 --> 06:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:20:50.948 --> 06:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
this public hearing will give people a
 
06:20:53.590 --> 06:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
chance to respond to the proposal on the
 
06:20:53.600 --> 06:20:54.708 align:start position:0%
chance to respond to the proposal on the
table

06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
table
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
and we'll see if it has enough merit to
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
go forward with some changes
 
06:21:03.270 --> 06:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
or if it needs to be scrapped
 
06:21:03.280 --> 06:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
or if it needs to be scrapped
and

06:21:04.000 --> 06:21:04.010 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:04.010 --> 06:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

06:21:06.070 --> 06:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:21:06.080 --> 06:21:07.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
a

06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:21:11.750 --> 06:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:14.070 --> 06:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed in 2019 and
 
06:21:16.470 --> 06:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
is already uh like 18 months
 
06:21:22.948 --> 06:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
from implementation
 
06:21:25.270 --> 06:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
18 months away from
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
having been
 
06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
an attempt being made to make it
 
06:21:30.948 --> 06:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
implementable and it it hasn't gotten
 
06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
there yet so this is an attempt to see
 
06:21:35.830 --> 06:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
if we can put something on the table to
 
06:21:38.310 --> 06:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
move it forward
 
06:21:40.868 --> 06:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
and the response we'll get today i think
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
will tell us whether or not that's
 
06:21:42.558 --> 06:21:48.310 align:start position:0%
will tell us whether or not that's
possible

06:21:48.310 --> 06:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:49.590 --> 06:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
06:21:49.600 --> 06:21:53.110 align:start position:0%
okay uh
representative

06:21:53.110 --> 06:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:53.120 --> 06:21:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
no

06:21:54.470 --> 06:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
bernardi is next not first
 
06:21:59.590 --> 06:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:03.840 --> 06:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:22:05.350 --> 06:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
just to get a
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
scope of this issue do you have a
 
06:22:12.788 --> 06:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
feeling or is there an understanding
 
06:22:12.798 --> 06:22:18.230 align:start position:0%
feeling or is there an understanding
from

06:22:18.230 --> 06:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:20.070 --> 06:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me can this be a little louder we
 
06:22:22.868 --> 06:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
can barely hear you
 
06:22:26.708 --> 06:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
approximately how many communities are
 
06:22:32.230 --> 06:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
interested in community aggregation and
 
06:22:34.310 --> 06:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
how many communities are interested in
 
06:22:36.948 --> 06:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
community power do you have a sense for
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:42.708 --> 06:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
that is a good question and my sense is
 
06:22:44.310 --> 06:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
the research that i've done that there
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
may be
 
06:22:50.470 --> 06:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
a few communities who are interested in
 
06:22:50.480 --> 06:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
a few communities who are interested in
aggregation

06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
06:22:53.510 --> 06:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
and a very few who might be interested
 
06:23:00.310 --> 06:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:00.320 --> 06:23:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:23:02.788 --> 06:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
06:23:06.070 --> 06:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
06:23:08.548 --> 06:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
representative vols
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the discussion of 315
 
06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
06:23:15.030 --> 06:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
two separate issues
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
so there is no
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
problem per se with the idea of
 
06:23:18.958 --> 06:23:20.150 align:start position:0%
problem per se with the idea of
community

06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:23:20.160 --> 06:23:21.430 align:start position:0%
community
communities

06:23:21.430 --> 06:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:23:21.440 --> 06:23:23.270 align:start position:0%
communities
municipalities

06:23:23.270 --> 06:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:23:25.190 --> 06:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
providing aggregated
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
power to customers
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct that should be as the
 
06:23:32.310 --> 06:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
governor says
 
06:23:33.590 --> 06:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure i think a lot of people think it's
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:41.190 --> 06:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
is it possible that municipalities
 
06:23:44.230 --> 06:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
can also produce and provide power this
 
06:23:46.948 --> 06:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
is a separate now not combined
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:52.708 --> 06:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
know if they can figure out how to do it
 
06:23:52.718 --> 06:23:53.830 align:start position:0%
know if they can figure out how to do it
um

06:23:53.830 --> 06:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:56.070 --> 06:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's no no issues there either a
 
06:23:56.080 --> 06:23:57.030 align:start position:0%
there's no no issues there either a
follow-up

06:23:57.030 --> 06:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:23:59.110 --> 06:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
third question mr chair
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:06.548 --> 06:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
so if community uh municipality
 
06:24:10.708 --> 06:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
can aggregate and wants to got a plan
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
and that same
 
06:24:12.718 --> 06:24:14.230 align:start position:0%
and that same
municipality

06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
06:24:15.910 --> 06:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
has a
 
06:24:18.310 --> 06:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
energy production for electricity
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
providing electricity
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
06:24:23.830 --> 06:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
problem you would see
 
06:24:25.590 --> 06:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
from them
 
06:24:27.510 --> 06:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
to use
 
06:24:29.830 --> 06:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
that municipality's
 
06:24:33.670 --> 06:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
provided power in for the aggregates
 
06:24:35.110 --> 06:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
well i think that's one of the issues
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
under dispute here is is how would that
 
06:24:38.400 --> 06:24:39.510 align:start position:0%
under dispute here is is how would that
happen

06:24:39.510 --> 06:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:24:39.520 --> 06:24:40.788 align:start position:0%
happen
uh

06:24:40.788 --> 06:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:40.798 --> 06:24:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh
and

06:24:42.470 --> 06:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:24:44.390 --> 06:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
is there any rule making that would be
 
06:24:47.030 --> 06:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to allow that to happen
 
06:24:48.868 --> 06:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of part of the impasse
 
06:24:51.030 --> 06:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address by putting this
 
06:24:54.628 --> 06:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
proposal on the table
 
06:24:57.670 --> 06:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
to get people to talk about
 
06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:25:01.270 --> 06:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
this is a an acceptable way to try to
 
06:25:03.510 --> 06:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
solve this problem
 
06:25:06.868 --> 06:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:08.470 --> 06:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative man i see you have your
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:14.788 --> 06:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you very much mr chairman
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to confess to being having
 
06:25:21.270 --> 06:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
having read the the bill and so on
 
06:25:23.510 --> 06:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh and everything i can but i'm very
 
06:25:26.230 --> 06:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
confused as to what the
 
06:25:28.948 --> 06:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
objectives are it's a very complex
 
06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
system seems to me if why does a town or
 
06:25:35.670 --> 06:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
a municipality want to take over
 
06:25:37.830 --> 06:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
solving all the problems
 
06:25:40.788 --> 06:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
in in all the houses in the municipality
 
06:25:43.030 --> 06:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
related to electricity
 
06:25:44.628 --> 06:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
when the
 
06:25:46.868 --> 06:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
the utilities have a tremendous amount
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
of expertise
 
06:25:50.948 --> 06:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
that is not i don't i'm not objecting to
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
06:25:54.868 --> 06:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
of aggregation but i don't understand it
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
well enough to understand what the point
 
06:25:58.948 --> 06:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
of it is
 
06:26:01.430 --> 06:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
what are the advantages to a town other
 
06:26:01.440 --> 06:26:02.628 align:start position:0%
what are the advantages to a town other
than

06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps having some generation of their
 
06:26:09.990 --> 06:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:10.000 --> 06:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:15.030 --> 06:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
where does these savings come from when
 
06:26:15.040 --> 06:26:16.390 align:start position:0%
where does these savings come from when
when

06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:26:18.470 --> 06:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know you aggregate all the customers
 
06:26:20.230 --> 06:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
in lebanon say
 
06:26:23.190 --> 06:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
and um somebody has got to deal with all
 
06:26:24.868 --> 06:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
that complexity
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
and what is the role of
 
06:26:28.868 --> 06:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
the utility in a
 
06:26:31.830 --> 06:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
in this whole situation so i think
 
06:26:34.230 --> 06:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
maybe it's i mean i'm not afraid to say
 
06:26:38.830 --> 06:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
um i just can't get a handle on the the
 
06:26:45.030 --> 06:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
how this thing is is something that's
 
06:26:46.470 --> 06:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
useful to try
 
06:26:48.788 --> 06:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
or that even is reasonable to try to
 
06:26:48.798 --> 06:26:50.150 align:start position:0%
or that even is reasonable to try to
operate

06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
operate
 
06:26:53.030 --> 06:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a pretty
 
06:26:56.390 --> 06:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:58.948 --> 06:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
i can easily i can easily just drop out
 
06:27:01.590 --> 06:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
and just listen but um
 
06:27:03.190 --> 06:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
i thought that might be a useful
 
06:27:06.070 --> 06:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
question to ask frankly
 
06:27:08.390 --> 06:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
06:27:10.468 --> 06:27:10.478 align:start position:0%
the crucial question and that's what i
 
06:27:11.830 --> 06:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
started with
 
06:27:13.590 --> 06:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
by explaining that there is a difference
 
06:27:15.910 --> 06:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
between aggregation and community
 
06:27:18.548 --> 06:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
aggregation and community power
 
06:27:21.350 --> 06:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
and mixing the two together
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
can lead to a lot of confusion and
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we're
 
06:27:25.840 --> 06:27:26.868 align:start position:0%
that's what we're
we're

06:27:26.868 --> 06:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:27:30.468 --> 06:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
trying to find a solution for
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
by putting this proposal on the table
 
06:27:38.070 --> 06:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:40.548 --> 06:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
might i suggest at this point that we
 
06:27:41.910 --> 06:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
let uh
 
06:27:43.670 --> 06:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
some of the other 26 people who want to
 
06:27:47.030 --> 06:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
other perspectives can be
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:57.670 --> 06:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts i see every
 
06:27:59.190 --> 06:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
hand up uh
 
06:28:03.750 --> 06:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
is it up or did you put it down it's up
 
06:28:06.788 --> 06:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
the question i had was a a technical
 
06:28:10.548 --> 06:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
question i think i was i'm 53e says
 
06:28:14.150 --> 06:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the in the revised from 315 that
 
06:28:15.430 --> 06:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
the utilities would be the
 
06:28:18.230 --> 06:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
administrators of the program but i i
 
06:28:20.628 --> 06:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
would like to know if somebody
 
06:28:22.548 --> 06:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
anybody can tell me
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
if the
 
06:28:25.830 --> 06:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
process leading up to rule making in the
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
rule making process
 
06:28:30.948 --> 06:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
is available anywhere if you can see it
 
06:28:32.868 --> 06:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
or read
 
06:28:35.590 --> 06:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
read discussion or testimony
 
06:28:38.468 --> 06:28:38.478 align:start position:0%
that's what i was interested in and i
 
06:28:41.270 --> 06:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it anywhere
 
06:28:44.070 --> 06:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh because formal rule making has
 
06:28:46.868 --> 06:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
not begun yet the only rule making
 
06:28:48.390 --> 06:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
discussions that have happened so far
 
06:28:50.948 --> 06:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
have been informal discussions
 
06:28:53.830 --> 06:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
and apparently they haven't been able to
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
achieve enough consensus to proceed to
 
06:28:58.468 --> 06:28:58.478 align:start position:0%
formal rule making
 
06:29:01.190 --> 06:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
there is some question about whether
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
that may start imminently
 
06:29:06.628 --> 06:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
but it has not started yet
 
06:29:10.468 --> 06:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:13.270 --> 06:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman rose i see no other
 
06:29:15.510 --> 06:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions so i think we'll move on to
 
06:29:17.430 --> 06:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
our next speaker which i believe on the
 
06:29:18.628 --> 06:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
list is a
 
06:29:18.638 --> 06:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
list is a

uh we respectfully submit these comments
 
06:30:19.990 --> 06:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the house science technology and

energy committee in support of the house
 
06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill 315
 
06:30:26.468 --> 06:30:26.478 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the opportunity to comment
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
on this piece of legislation that's
 
06:30:29.750 --> 06:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
designed to enhance that electric
 
06:30:31.750 --> 06:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
aggregation and through this process
 
06:30:33.590 --> 06:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
consider other suggestions to strengthen
 
06:30:35.350 --> 06:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
the bill which would open the state's
 
06:30:37.110 --> 06:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
retail market while providing more
 
06:30:39.670 --> 06:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
options and functionality for customers
 
06:30:42.310 --> 06:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
eei is the association that represents
 
06:30:44.150 --> 06:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
all u.s investor owned electric
 
06:30:45.830 --> 06:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
companies our members provide
 
06:30:47.910 --> 06:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
electricity for more than 220 million
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
americans and operate in all 50 states
 
06:30:52.310 --> 06:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
as well as the district of columbia
 
06:30:54.628 --> 06:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
eei's members include all investor-owned
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
electric companies that serve customers
 
06:30:57.910 --> 06:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:30:59.990 --> 06:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
retail electric choice and the ability
 
06:31:01.910 --> 06:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
for customers to actively choose from
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
whom they want to receive electric
 
06:31:05.590 --> 06:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
generation is nothing new for the state
 
06:31:06.948 --> 06:31:06.958 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
06:31:09.190 --> 06:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
in fact the ability for customers to
 
06:31:11.030 --> 06:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
make an affirmative choice has been in
 
06:31:12.948 --> 06:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
effect for over two decades
 
06:31:14.548 --> 06:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
as with other restructured electric
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
states new hampshire both through
 
06:31:18.868 --> 06:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
legislative and regulatory proposals
 
06:31:20.788 --> 06:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
periodically considers refinements
 
06:31:22.708 --> 06:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
designed to enhance the retail electric
 
06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
market such as house bill 315
 
06:31:27.030 --> 06:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's with this desire for new
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire's customers to have more
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
options and greater functionality that
 
06:31:33.670 --> 06:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
eei submits comments regarding this bill
 
06:31:35.430 --> 06:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
community aggregation which is what you
 
06:31:37.590 --> 06:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
just heard which is available if in a
 
06:31:39.030 --> 06:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
handful of states including new
 
06:31:39.040 --> 06:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
handful of states including new
hampshire

06:31:39.990 --> 06:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:31:42.070 --> 06:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
is a program that allows localities and
 
06:31:43.910 --> 06:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities to procure power from
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
alternative suppliers while still
 
06:31:48.230 --> 06:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
retaining their local energy company for
 
06:31:50.628 --> 06:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
distribution transmission and other
 
06:31:53.190 --> 06:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
associated regulated functions including
 
06:31:55.670 --> 06:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
billing electric assistance and net
 
06:31:55.680 --> 06:31:56.788 align:start position:0%
billing electric assistance and net
metering

06:31:56.788 --> 06:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
metering
 
06:31:58.868 --> 06:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
house bill 315 is an important piece of
 
06:32:00.868 --> 06:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
legislation because it ensures that
 
06:32:03.830 --> 06:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
these customer protections remain intact
 
06:32:05.430 --> 06:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to the bill that's before
 
06:32:07.590 --> 06:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
you we do have some suggestions to
 
06:32:08.948 --> 06:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
strengthen the bill's impact for
 
06:32:08.958 --> 06:32:10.230 align:start position:0%
strengthen the bill's impact for
customers

06:32:10.230 --> 06:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
customers
 
06:32:12.070 --> 06:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
the first would be more guidance around
 
06:32:14.230 --> 06:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
the procurement timeline and the amount
 
06:32:16.948 --> 06:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
of load associated with aggregations to
 
06:32:18.868 --> 06:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
better coordinate and avoid stranded
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
costs for default service
 
06:32:22.548 --> 06:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
while the aggregation program is
 
06:32:25.270 --> 06:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
contemplated must have commission review
 
06:32:27.670 --> 06:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 315 is silent as to the
 
06:32:29.990 --> 06:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
interplay width or overlap of default
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
service procurements
 
06:32:33.510 --> 06:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
in order to resolve this absence and to
 
06:32:35.110 --> 06:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
better protect customers and energy
 
06:32:36.868 --> 06:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
companies from procuring power that they
 
06:32:39.110 --> 06:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
may not ultimately need the commission
 
06:32:40.390 --> 06:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
should be given the authority to
 
06:32:42.548 --> 06:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
determine whether aggregation enrollment
 
06:32:44.070 --> 06:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
should conform to default service
 
06:32:44.080 --> 06:32:45.350 align:start position:0%
should conform to default service
schedules

06:32:45.350 --> 06:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
schedules
 
06:32:47.270 --> 06:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
the second is the creation of a purchase
 
06:32:49.190 --> 06:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
of receivables program
 
06:32:51.670 --> 06:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
under this construct the local electric
 
06:32:53.430 --> 06:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
company would purchase the receivables
 
06:32:55.750 --> 06:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
of suppliers minus a discount rate
 
06:32:57.510 --> 06:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's approved by the commission
 
06:32:59.030 --> 06:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
these programs are common in
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
long-standing and other restructured
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
states such as connecticut maryland
 
06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts pennsylvania and new york
 
06:33:08.070 --> 06:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
when these programs are in place there's
 
06:33:10.230 --> 06:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
both more shopping and more customer
 
06:33:10.240 --> 06:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
both more shopping and more customer
satisfaction

06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
satisfaction
 
06:33:13.190 --> 06:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
06:33:15.190 --> 06:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
public comment on these issues
 
06:33:17.350 --> 06:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
eei remains available going forward to
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
work with the house science technology
 
06:33:20.868 --> 06:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
and energy committee as it builds on its
 
06:33:22.628 --> 06:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
experience and refines its retail
 
06:33:24.468 --> 06:33:24.478 align:start position:0%
electric market programs of policy for
 
06:33:26.468 --> 06:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
the state we look forward to working
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
with both the committee and other
 
06:33:29.510 --> 06:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders as you set a
 
06:33:31.190 --> 06:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
pathway for access to the retail
 
06:33:33.590 --> 06:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
electric market the benefit that's all
 
06:33:36.390 --> 06:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's citizens

do not um i i but we will be following
 
06:33:55.510 --> 06:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
up um we understand from listening to
 
06:33:56.948 --> 06:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
the chair's testimony that there's going
 
06:33:59.270 --> 06:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
to be an amendment so if possible uh we
 
06:34:01.110 --> 06:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
were hoping to wait to see the amendment
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
and then submit something electronically
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
to the full committee

i am also the chief operating officer of

we are a consulting energy consulting
 
06:35:21.990 --> 06:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
firm here in the state of new hampshire
 
06:35:24.788 --> 06:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
and i was very much involved
 
06:35:24.798 --> 06:35:25.590 align:start position:0%
and i was very much involved
in

06:35:25.590 --> 06:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:35:28.230 --> 06:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
the progress and eventual passage of sb
 
06:35:28.240 --> 06:35:29.590 align:start position:0%
the progress and eventual passage of sb
286

06:35:29.590 --> 06:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
286
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
which was the enabling legislation for
 
06:35:36.310 --> 06:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
community choice aggregation and
 
06:35:37.910 --> 06:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
i come before you today because i'm in
 
06:35:40.868 --> 06:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 315
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
as it is currently
 
06:35:42.718 --> 06:35:43.990 align:start position:0%
as it is currently
written

06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:35:45.990 --> 06:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
now i am open and hopeful for some
 
06:35:47.270 --> 06:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
changes that can
 
06:35:49.750 --> 06:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
help to move this market forward
 
06:35:52.788 --> 06:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
um i have been an active participant uh
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
in the informal process that's taking
 
06:35:57.110 --> 06:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
place at the puc surrounding the uh the
 
06:35:59.350 --> 06:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
rule rules promulgation
 
06:36:00.868 --> 06:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
one thing i can assure you through that
 
06:36:00.878 --> 06:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
one thing i can assure you through that
process

06:36:02.150 --> 06:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:36:04.468 --> 06:36:04.478 align:start position:0%
is that we would have active ccas in
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
place right now in the state of new
 
06:36:08.310 --> 06:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire but there is a disagreement
 
06:36:08.320 --> 06:36:09.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire but there is a disagreement
between

06:36:09.830 --> 06:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
many of us stakeholders in eversource in
 
06:36:13.430 --> 06:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
terms of whether or not they would be in
 
06:36:13.440 --> 06:36:14.788 align:start position:0%
terms of whether or not they would be in
violation

06:36:14.788 --> 06:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
violation
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
of utility privatization statutes uh in
 
06:36:19.830 --> 06:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
terms of furnishing account level
 
06:36:21.990 --> 06:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
information which is needed uh by
 
06:36:24.628 --> 06:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
aggregators to move forward uh with a
 
06:36:26.230 --> 06:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
community choice aggregation so that
 
06:36:27.990 --> 06:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's really been the the crux or the
 
06:36:30.468 --> 06:36:30.478 align:start position:0%
largest hold up we've had so far
 
06:36:34.628 --> 06:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh now in terms of what's in hb 315 uh
 
06:36:37.350 --> 06:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
that that we are so opposed to uh
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
there's it breaks down on three
 
06:36:40.390 --> 06:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
different levels
 
06:36:42.548 --> 06:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
so in terms of how the bill was
 
06:36:43.910 --> 06:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
introduced and some of the language that
 
06:36:45.670 --> 06:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
was put forward
 
06:36:49.750 --> 06:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
first is the puc oversight proposal
 
06:36:52.390 --> 06:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
puc oversight is utilized by our
 
06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the south of massachusetts
 
06:36:56.628 --> 06:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
and that process can take upwards of a
 
06:36:59.830 --> 06:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
year in terms of hearings and reviews uh
 
06:37:01.750 --> 06:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
of these plans before they get final
 
06:37:01.760 --> 06:37:02.948 align:start position:0%
of these plans before they get final
approval

06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
approval
 
06:37:06.150 --> 06:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh now eversource has asked uh or or has
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
put this forward uh i would ascertain
 
06:37:11.430 --> 06:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
because of their their long-standing
 
06:37:14.390 --> 06:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
request at the informal puc process
 
06:37:17.830 --> 06:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
that each uh aggregation start and stop
 
06:37:19.830 --> 06:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh in line with the standard offer
 
06:37:22.468 --> 06:37:22.478 align:start position:0%
cycles uh eversource and the other
 
06:37:24.948 --> 06:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
utilities have asked us to agree in the
 
06:37:27.190 --> 06:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
rules uh that any community that wanted
 
06:37:29.590 --> 06:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
to move forward with cca uh would have
 
06:37:30.948 --> 06:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
to essentially
 
06:37:33.990 --> 06:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh agree to uh sending out their price
 
06:37:34.000 --> 06:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
uh agree to uh sending out their price
notifications

06:37:35.430 --> 06:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
notifications
 
06:37:37.270 --> 06:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:37:39.830 --> 06:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
opt-out notifications to their uh
 
06:37:42.310 --> 06:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
to their communities uh four or five
 
06:37:44.310 --> 06:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
months prior to when a standard offer
 
06:37:45.670 --> 06:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
cycle begins
 
06:37:47.190 --> 06:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
the problem with this and why this is
 
06:37:49.110 --> 06:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
completely unworkable from from our
 
06:37:51.110 --> 06:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
vantage point is because you're asking
 
06:37:53.350 --> 06:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
community leaders to take significant
 
06:37:55.990 --> 06:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
risk by moving forward on offering a
 
06:37:57.830 --> 06:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
price to their constituencies without
 
06:37:59.270 --> 06:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
knowing what the price to compare is
 
06:38:00.628 --> 06:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
the other issue that we have with this
 
06:38:04.628 --> 06:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
is the fact that by getting on and off
 
06:38:06.548 --> 06:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
during the standard offer cycles it
 
06:38:08.070 --> 06:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
takes away one of the greatest
 
06:38:08.080 --> 06:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
takes away one of the greatest
advantages

06:38:09.270 --> 06:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
advantages
 
06:38:11.830 --> 06:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
for a successful cca in any marketplace
 
06:38:13.830 --> 06:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the ability to
 
06:38:16.948 --> 06:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
to move forward and to contract based
 
06:38:18.708 --> 06:38:18.718 align:start position:0%
upon market signals
 
06:38:20.390 --> 06:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues with the standard
 
06:38:21.910 --> 06:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
offer procurements that we have in the
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
state is that they start and stop at
 
06:38:26.468 --> 06:38:26.478 align:start position:0%
predetermined times irregardless of what
 
06:38:28.708 --> 06:38:28.718 align:start position:0%
the market is doing at that point
 
06:38:31.270 --> 06:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
if we take that away from these ccas uh
 
06:38:34.230 --> 06:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
that will be a a huge burden in terms of
 
06:38:35.910 --> 06:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
them being able to be price competitive
 
06:38:37.510 --> 06:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
with the utilities
 
06:38:39.590 --> 06:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
to answer one of representative mann's
 
06:38:39.600 --> 06:38:41.110 align:start position:0%
to answer one of representative mann's
questions

06:38:41.110 --> 06:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:38:43.030 --> 06:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
the other issue is that some of the
 
06:38:44.230 --> 06:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
wording that they put in the bill is
 
06:38:46.150 --> 06:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
rather sneaky in terms of how they've
 
06:38:47.590 --> 06:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
said that they wanted to work with us
 
06:38:49.830 --> 06:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
and find compromise and that this bill
 
06:38:52.230 --> 06:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
was presented to chairman vos and others
 
06:38:54.070 --> 06:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the context of how can we move
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
forward if you take a look at the bill
 
06:38:58.628 --> 06:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
eversource puts in a strict prohibition
 
06:39:01.190 --> 06:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
on any incidental cost
 
06:39:03.750 --> 06:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be borne by the tax base of any
 
06:39:06.310 --> 06:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
community even in the investigation of
 
06:39:08.628 --> 06:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the cca so when they
 
06:39:11.750 --> 06:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
put forward uh the proposal that the puc
 
06:39:11.760 --> 06:39:13.190 align:start position:0%
put forward uh the proposal that the puc
review

06:39:13.190 --> 06:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:39:13.200 --> 06:39:14.230 align:start position:0%
review
these

06:39:14.230 --> 06:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:39:16.628 --> 06:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
cca plans a community
 
06:39:18.628 --> 06:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
based upon this law if it were to pass
 
06:39:20.788 --> 06:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
as written would not even be able to
 
06:39:22.948 --> 06:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
hire council to represent them during
 
06:39:25.270 --> 06:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
the puc process because all costs have
 
06:39:28.870 --> 06:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be born out of the cca program itself
 
06:39:28.880 --> 06:39:30.150 align:start position:0%
to be born out of the cca program itself
[Music]

06:39:30.150 --> 06:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
that needs to be uh to be dealt with
 
06:39:36.310 --> 06:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh on another issue is that 286 was
 
06:39:38.548 --> 06:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for opt-out
 
06:39:41.270 --> 06:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
aggregation we've had opt-in aggregation
 
06:39:43.590 --> 06:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
on the books for quite some time opt-in
 
06:39:45.030 --> 06:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
aggregation is basically when the
 
06:39:46.628 --> 06:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
customer comes and makes an affirmative
 
06:39:48.948 --> 06:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
decision signs a contract and says yes
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
i'd like to be part of your plan
 
06:39:52.628 --> 06:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
opt out is when a notice is sent out to
 
06:39:54.230 --> 06:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
the entire community and the community
 
06:39:56.628 --> 06:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
is given 30 days to respond if they do
 
06:39:58.468 --> 06:39:58.478 align:start position:0%
not respond they've deemed to have
 
06:40:00.390 --> 06:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
accepted the program this has
 
06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
significant benefit in that it reduces
 
06:40:05.430 --> 06:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
costs for customer acquisition and
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
really puts us on par as an alternative
 
06:40:09.510 --> 06:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
default supplier if you will or
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
alternative standard offer one of the
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
problems presented by hp 315 is that as
 
06:40:18.788 --> 06:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
written today it calls on communities to
 
06:40:20.948 --> 06:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
use public records to send out those
 
06:40:23.350 --> 06:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
notifications rather than any
 
06:40:25.590 --> 06:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
cooperation by the utilities well the
 
06:40:27.190 --> 06:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
problem with that is even we send out
 
06:40:29.430 --> 06:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
the notifications through our tax rolls
 
06:40:31.510 --> 06:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
or other mechanisms we don't have any
 
06:40:33.910 --> 06:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
account level data that was necessary to
 
06:40:36.150 --> 06:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
a price that customer or b enroll that
 
06:40:38.628 --> 06:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
customer in the program
 
06:40:41.510 --> 06:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
data that's needed
 
06:40:43.510 --> 06:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's judd
 
06:40:45.590 --> 06:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
hi chad
 
06:40:45.600 --> 06:40:46.788 align:start position:0%
hi chad
yucky

06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
yucky
 
06:40:48.868 --> 06:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for testimony any questions
 
06:40:54.868 --> 06:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:59.830 --> 06:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:01.990 --> 06:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
06:41:03.430 --> 06:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
06:41:03.440 --> 06:41:04.788 align:start position:0%
your testimony
um

06:41:04.788 --> 06:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:41:06.548 --> 06:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you're
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
someone who is actually
 
06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh sitting at the table
 
06:41:13.670 --> 06:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh as far as trying to figure this out
 
06:41:17.030 --> 06:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the previous uh
 
06:41:20.788 --> 06:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
first person who testified ms linton
 
06:41:23.590 --> 06:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
ketty said that there are
 
06:41:25.350 --> 06:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
quite a few states that are already
 
06:41:27.510 --> 06:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
doing this community
 
06:41:27.520 --> 06:41:29.110 align:start position:0%
doing this community
aggregation

06:41:29.110 --> 06:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that it's they're doing it
 
06:41:31.680 --> 06:41:32.628 align:start position:0%
and that it's they're doing it
and

06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:34.548 --> 06:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a person that don't look
 
06:41:37.510 --> 06:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't like reinventing the wheel have
 
06:41:38.948 --> 06:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
has your group
 
06:41:40.708 --> 06:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
spent much time
 
06:41:43.510 --> 06:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
looking at how they are doing it
 
06:41:43.520 --> 06:41:44.468 align:start position:0%
looking at how they are doing it
and

06:41:44.468 --> 06:41:44.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:46.230 --> 06:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
trying to use
 
06:41:49.030 --> 06:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
those things as a template for what we
 
06:41:51.270 --> 06:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
do in this state
 
06:41:52.628 --> 06:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you for the question
 
06:41:54.868 --> 06:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
representative and yes we we have taken
 
06:41:57.590 --> 06:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
a look at how this is um this has been
 
06:41:59.830 --> 06:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
brought forth in other states i can tell
 
06:42:01.670 --> 06:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
you uh that by looking at every other
 
06:42:04.628 --> 06:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
state that has an active cca marketplace
 
06:42:07.430 --> 06:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
no other state requires their ccas to
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
start and stop on the standard offer
 
06:42:11.750 --> 06:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
cycle uh that that requirement is is
 
06:42:13.190 --> 06:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
nowhere to be found in the united states
 
06:42:14.708 --> 06:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
in the the eight active markets that
 
06:42:20.230 --> 06:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:21.590 --> 06:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:42:22.948 --> 06:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative harrington do you have a
 
06:42:22.958 --> 06:42:26.948 align:start position:0%
representative harrington do you have a
question

06:42:26.948 --> 06:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:29.110 --> 06:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
get unmuted here uh yes thank you and
 
06:42:32.150 --> 06:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh uh mr chairman or vice
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
06:42:37.110 --> 06:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
mr falmouth uh my question is uh
 
06:42:38.548 --> 06:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
no one's been mentioning the thing about
 
06:42:40.150 --> 06:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
meters on this thing which is kind of
 
06:42:41.190 --> 06:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
like a
 
06:42:43.110 --> 06:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
little pain in my butt on this because
 
06:42:45.350 --> 06:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion on it
 
06:42:47.510 --> 06:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
with other people and
 
06:42:48.948 --> 06:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
we have to you know if you're going to
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
go to the community aggregators then you
 
06:42:52.390 --> 06:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
someone has to have the meter on the
 
06:42:54.468 --> 06:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
house and i don't think the utilities
 
06:42:56.868 --> 06:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
are going to allow the community
 
06:42:58.868 --> 06:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
aggregators to have a meter there unless
 
06:43:00.390 --> 06:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
it undergoes the
 
06:43:02.708 --> 06:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
multiple pages of regulations that the
 
06:43:05.350 --> 06:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
puc requires a utility meter
 
06:43:07.430 --> 06:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh so there's a possibility of double
 
06:43:09.670 --> 06:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
meters but so how would you what what's
 
06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
the solution to the meter issue
 
06:43:13.990 --> 06:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
well i i thought there was a a rather
 
06:43:15.750 --> 06:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
elegant solution in the current law
 
06:43:18.310 --> 06:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
under sb286 so that that calls for
 
06:43:20.868 --> 06:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
either community owned meters to be uh
 
06:43:23.270 --> 06:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
jointly applied with uh or a second
 
06:43:24.868 --> 06:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
meter if you will to be put on top of
 
06:43:27.990 --> 06:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
the utility meter uh or or co-ownership
 
06:43:29.990 --> 06:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
with with the utility it it gives the
 
06:43:32.548 --> 06:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
communities an opportunity uh to invest
 
06:43:34.868 --> 06:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
themselves or invest with the utilities
 
06:43:37.270 --> 06:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
um the bill also called for a review
 
06:43:39.190 --> 06:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
process by the puc
 
06:43:41.510 --> 06:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
um which was helpful in that regard to
 
06:43:43.830 --> 06:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that um that the me the meters
 
06:43:45.510 --> 06:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
were uh
 
06:43:47.430 --> 06:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
the quality uh that they they needed to
 
06:43:47.440 --> 06:43:48.310 align:start position:0%
the quality uh that they they needed to
be

06:43:48.310 --> 06:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:43:49.910 --> 06:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that's really important uh
 
06:43:52.150 --> 06:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
from a community choice aggregation and
 
06:43:53.750 --> 06:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was a kind of a
 
06:43:56.468 --> 06:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
big success i thought from 286 was
 
06:43:58.390 --> 06:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
it allows through this additional
 
06:44:02.230 --> 06:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
metering upgrade opportunity uh to bring
 
06:44:03.510 --> 06:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities such as demand side
 
06:44:05.590 --> 06:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
management to the residential uh user
 
06:44:07.030 --> 06:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's something right now that all of
 
06:44:09.350 --> 06:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
our c i customers in the state have an
 
06:44:11.350 --> 06:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to partake in because they
 
06:44:13.990 --> 06:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
have specialized time of use meters uh
 
06:44:15.750 --> 06:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
time abuse seaters will tell you
 
06:44:17.670 --> 06:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
obviously when you use your power and
 
06:44:19.910 --> 06:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's helpful uh for these these um
 
06:44:22.150 --> 06:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
these demand curtailments which can not
 
06:44:24.070 --> 06:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
only help the individual user in terms
 
06:44:26.548 --> 06:44:26.558 align:start position:0%
of their capacity obligations but can be
 
06:44:28.548 --> 06:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
a net benefit to all regional
 
06:44:30.468 --> 06:44:30.478 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and that's a big
 
06:44:32.708 --> 06:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
reason why eversource unitil and liberty
 
06:44:33.990 --> 06:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
support them and have their own
 
06:44:35.510 --> 06:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
individual demand side management
 
06:44:37.750 --> 06:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
programs but again unfortunately those
 
06:44:39.350 --> 06:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
are only offered to commercial
 
06:44:42.230 --> 06:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
industrial customers so in keeping uh
 
06:44:45.190 --> 06:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the the uh the mission of 286
 
06:44:46.628 --> 06:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
bringing these opportunities finally to
 
06:44:48.230 --> 06:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
the residential and small commercial
 
06:44:50.070 --> 06:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
customer metering is a is a big
 
06:44:52.390 --> 06:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
component of that and i i think you know
 
06:44:54.708 --> 06:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
without the metering language staying in
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
there we won't have that opportunity
 
06:45:03.590 --> 06:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:05.590 --> 06:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i i guess i'm trying to get down
 
06:45:08.150 --> 06:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
more basic is uh the meter on the side
 
06:45:10.548 --> 06:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
if you have a community aggregated uh uh
 
06:45:13.270 --> 06:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
house so who owns the meter on the side
 
06:45:14.788 --> 06:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
of the house and if it's the community
 
06:45:17.110 --> 06:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
aggregator to what standards that they
 
06:45:19.350 --> 06:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
have to calibrate that to and so forth i
 
06:45:21.350 --> 06:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
just it's going to be an issue
 
06:45:23.990 --> 06:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think because the utilities are not
 
06:45:26.070 --> 06:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
going to go along with any
 
06:45:28.948 --> 06:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
meter results that don't meet their own
 
06:45:30.230 --> 06:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
standards so i'm just trying to think
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
how would you resolve that issue
 
06:45:34.868 --> 06:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
well we see that actually again somewhat
 
06:45:36.948 --> 06:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of these demand
 
06:45:39.110 --> 06:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
response programs and outside vendors
 
06:45:41.030 --> 06:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
are hired to implement these programs
 
06:45:44.070 --> 06:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
and uh they have approved revenue grade
 
06:45:46.868 --> 06:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
meters that they install on any building
 
06:45:48.548 --> 06:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
that participates in these programs
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
specifically the iso new england uh
 
06:45:54.390 --> 06:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
programs uh um and and so i would expect
 
06:45:56.310 --> 06:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
that would that would unfold in a very
 
06:45:58.628 --> 06:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
similar fashion uh for the residential
 
06:46:00.548 --> 06:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
customer and and again if you take a
 
06:46:02.868 --> 06:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
look at the original language in 286 it
 
06:46:02.878 --> 06:46:03.990 align:start position:0%
look at the original language in 286 it
enables

06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
enables
 
06:46:05.830 --> 06:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
the community to go and take on that
 
06:46:08.628 --> 06:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
cost uh while working with the utilities
 
06:46:11.430 --> 06:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
and with puc approval in order to get
 
06:46:13.430 --> 06:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
there so i i think we we do have that
 
06:46:16.150 --> 06:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
covered it's not as though a community
 
06:46:17.350 --> 06:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
or an aggregate
 
06:46:18.948 --> 06:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
act sorry aggregator can just go and
 
06:46:21.430 --> 06:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
throw on a meter and hope for the best
 
06:46:23.350 --> 06:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
there is significant oversight already
 
06:46:26.788 --> 06:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
built into 286. thank you
 
06:46:28.150 --> 06:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:46:28.160 --> 06:46:29.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
next

06:46:29.110 --> 06:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
next
 
06:46:30.708 --> 06:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative dodder had her hand up
 
06:46:32.468 --> 06:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
please for a question thank you mr
 
06:46:35.110 --> 06:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and hey judd can you hear me i
 
06:46:36.708 --> 06:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
can hear you
 
06:46:39.350 --> 06:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you um
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
who would pay for these extra meters
 
06:46:45.030 --> 06:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
so a great question and and uh so as
 
06:46:47.990 --> 06:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
part of the puc process uh there can be
 
06:46:50.548 --> 06:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
an agreement between uh the utilities in
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
the community where they share payment
 
06:46:53.910 --> 06:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh again they both have to meet uh
 
06:46:56.230 --> 06:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
mutually acceptable terms the community
 
06:46:57.910 --> 06:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
can also offer to pay for the meters
 
06:46:59.910 --> 06:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
outright and one thing that we see in
 
06:47:01.990 --> 06:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions that have community
 
06:47:03.830 --> 06:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
choice aggregation is that they'll
 
06:47:06.310 --> 06:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
typically go and put that cost uh for
 
06:47:08.390 --> 06:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of those meter upgrades into
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
the base rate for that community choice
 
06:47:12.468 --> 06:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
aggregation plan so when i hear some of
 
06:47:13.910 --> 06:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
you mention the fact that you don't want
 
06:47:16.230 --> 06:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
anybody not involved in the aggregation
 
06:47:19.030 --> 06:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
to bear the costs of these programs this
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
is a great solve for that because only
 
06:47:22.230 --> 06:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
people that will be involved in the
 
06:47:23.910 --> 06:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
community choice aggregation will be
 
06:47:28.310 --> 06:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
paying for those meter costs thank you
 
06:47:31.030 --> 06:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh riverside pitcher handed up
 
06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
06:47:35.030 --> 06:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes one thank you one of the things that
 
06:47:37.830 --> 06:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
really bothers me is the data mining
 
06:47:37.840 --> 06:47:38.628 align:start position:0%
really bothers me is the data mining
i

06:47:38.628 --> 06:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:47:41.910 --> 06:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
ha once the data leaves
 
06:47:43.510 --> 06:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
06:47:45.750 --> 06:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
what are the protections from for the
 
06:47:48.070 --> 06:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
customer that it is not going to go
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:53.910 --> 06:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
that i i can tell you representative
 
06:47:55.910 --> 06:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
kelly pitts i i am not an expert in that
 
06:47:57.190 --> 06:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i'd be the wrong person to answer
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
that question um there might be a few
 
06:48:00.230 --> 06:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
people behind me that that could answer
 
06:48:02.070 --> 06:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
that one for you okay we'll leave that
 
06:48:06.230 --> 06:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:08.548 --> 06:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
representative samsic you're next on the
 
06:48:08.558 --> 06:48:15.030 align:start position:0%
representative samsic you're next on the
question

06:48:15.030 --> 06:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:17.350 --> 06:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much
 
06:48:20.390 --> 06:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you mr forma for
 
06:48:22.708 --> 06:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:48:24.468 --> 06:48:24.478 align:start position:0%
since since it was mentioned a couple
 
06:48:24.478 --> 06:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
since since it was mentioned a couple
times

06:48:25.510 --> 06:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
times
 
06:48:27.190 --> 06:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
in passing
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
it sounded like people were saying
 
06:48:35.350 --> 06:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:37.990 --> 06:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
would i be correct in assuming that in
 
06:48:41.190 --> 06:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
fact i as a resident if i am able to
 
06:48:44.788 --> 06:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
pick my power supplier which i can now
 
06:48:47.030 --> 06:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a form of aggregation of
 
06:48:49.670 --> 06:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
one you know i i chose to select the
 
06:48:49.680 --> 06:48:50.868 align:start position:0%
one you know i i chose to select the
supplier

06:48:50.868 --> 06:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
06:48:53.430 --> 06:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's the price i chose that
 
06:48:55.830 --> 06:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the same is true for for
 
06:48:58.390 --> 06:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
businesses however businesses are
 
06:48:58.400 --> 06:48:59.910 align:start position:0%
businesses however businesses are
dramatically

06:48:59.910 --> 06:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
06:49:02.390 --> 06:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
involved in commercial and industrial
 
06:49:03.510 --> 06:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
are already
 
06:49:06.150 --> 06:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
involved dramatically in getting their
 
06:49:08.548 --> 06:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
own source of power i think it's
 
06:49:10.390 --> 06:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
something like 80 percent of them have
 
06:49:12.628 --> 06:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
chosen not the default rate
 
06:49:14.788 --> 06:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
while only 18 percent of residents
 
06:49:15.830 --> 06:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
choose it
 
06:49:19.430 --> 06:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
so is that in fact kind of the model for
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
aggregation where now a town can get
 
06:49:24.070 --> 06:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
together and say i want to do the same
 
06:49:26.948 --> 06:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
as a business that goes out to bid
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
and and that that is not happening right
 
06:49:30.708 --> 06:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
now i mean i i don't think it's
 
06:49:33.110 --> 06:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
happening right now is it
 
06:49:35.270 --> 06:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
well as you pointed out your numbers are
 
06:49:37.110 --> 06:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
accurate yes it's about 18 of
 
06:49:38.548 --> 06:49:38.558 align:start position:0%
residential customers are taking
 
06:49:39.750 --> 06:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of the current competitive
 
06:49:41.830 --> 06:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
marketplace the commercial industrial
 
06:49:42.868 --> 06:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
numbers are probably a little bit closer
 
06:49:45.430 --> 06:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
to 90 in terms of who are choosing
 
06:49:47.990 --> 06:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
third-party suppliers a big reason for
 
06:49:49.990 --> 06:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
that is because of the fact that
 
06:49:51.750 --> 06:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
on the residential side everything is is
 
06:49:53.190 --> 06:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
largely take it or leave it there's no
 
06:49:55.590 --> 06:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
negotiating there's no uh there's
 
06:49:57.750 --> 06:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's no differentiation of contracts
 
06:50:00.150 --> 06:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's kind of a mass market offer
 
06:50:02.708 --> 06:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
and if you like it great take it if not
 
06:50:04.948 --> 06:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know stay with standard offer one
 
06:50:07.110 --> 06:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the the the big benefits of of
 
06:50:09.830 --> 06:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
aggregating lots of users like yourself
 
06:50:11.750 --> 06:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
and going through the community leaders
 
06:50:13.190 --> 06:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh that are making the decision to move
 
06:50:14.150 --> 06:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
forward with community choice
 
06:50:16.310 --> 06:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
aggregation is that the overall load
 
06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they represent is on par with some
 
06:50:19.590 --> 06:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
of the largest users that we have on the
 
06:50:21.270 --> 06:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial side in this state
 
06:50:22.468 --> 06:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
so your buying power and your
 
06:50:24.468 --> 06:50:24.478 align:start position:0%
negotiating power your leverage if you
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
will is much more significant than the
 
06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
average resident on their own so there
 
06:50:31.350 --> 06:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of benefit in that
 
06:50:33.750 --> 06:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow up mr chairman
 
06:50:35.670 --> 06:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
06:50:35.680 --> 06:50:36.468 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
so

06:50:36.468 --> 06:50:36.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:50:36.478 --> 06:50:39.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:50:39.110 --> 06:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:41.030 --> 06:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
because i mean
 
06:50:43.190 --> 06:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
well i hear from a lot of constituents
 
06:50:45.510 --> 06:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
of mine when i mentioned that they could
 
06:50:47.670 --> 06:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
choose their own power supplier one of
 
06:50:49.590 --> 06:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
the biggest things
 
06:50:52.310 --> 06:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
reservations they have is they're not
 
06:50:54.708 --> 06:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
sure about this system can i depend on
 
06:50:57.110 --> 06:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
this can i get is this fraudulent or
 
06:50:59.590 --> 06:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
whatever and it seems to me and i don't
 
06:51:01.590 --> 06:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
know if you would agree with this that
 
06:51:03.750 --> 06:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
aggregating in a municipality would give
 
06:51:05.430 --> 06:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people more confidence that
 
06:51:08.868 --> 06:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
this is a process that they can trust
 
06:51:11.030 --> 06:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
i i would agree with the fact that
 
06:51:13.110 --> 06:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more oversight and again
 
06:51:15.030 --> 06:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
leverage to get better contractual terms
 
06:51:16.628 --> 06:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
so when i hear a lot of people complain
 
06:51:18.070 --> 06:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
about how the residential marketplace
 
06:51:20.390 --> 06:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
has unfolded over the last uh 10 years
 
06:51:23.110 --> 06:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
or so the biggest issue is that people
 
06:51:25.110 --> 06:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
sign up for one rate it looked good at
 
06:51:26.310 --> 06:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
the time they were doing better than
 
06:51:28.548 --> 06:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
ever source 12 months went by and next
 
06:51:30.628 --> 06:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
thing i know uh their bill doubled on
 
06:51:32.948 --> 06:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
them with the community choice program
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to happen because
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
of the fact that the community elders
 
06:51:37.750 --> 06:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
are the ones negotiating the contracts
 
06:51:39.030 --> 06:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to let the contract
 
06:51:40.708 --> 06:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
lapse they're going to have provisions
 
06:51:42.390 --> 06:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
in there to either return to the utility
 
06:51:44.390 --> 06:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the deal or seek out a new
 
06:51:44.400 --> 06:51:45.590 align:start position:0%
at the end of the deal or seek out a new
vendor

06:51:45.590 --> 06:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
06:51:48.230 --> 06:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:51:50.310 --> 06:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do i have any
 
06:51:53.830 --> 06:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
other hands left for questions for uh
 
06:51:57.270 --> 06:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:59.030 --> 06:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
anybody at all
 
06:52:03.270 --> 06:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:03.280 --> 06:52:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:52:04.150 --> 06:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:52:06.788 --> 06:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
next on the list is mr
 
06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
clifton baylo
 
06:52:10.708 --> 06:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
from lebanon
 
06:52:25.350 --> 06:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:25.360 --> 06:52:26.788 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:52:26.788 --> 06:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:52:26.798 --> 06:52:28.628 align:start position:0%
okay
it

06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:52:30.390 --> 06:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
had to reset me
 
06:52:34.230 --> 06:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:36.390 --> 06:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um i want to
 
06:52:38.628 --> 06:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank the uh sponsors for their good
 
06:52:42.150 --> 06:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
intentions i appreciate the fact that uh
 
06:52:44.310 --> 06:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
they see that they're trying to help
 
06:52:46.948 --> 06:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
move this along um and they're certainly
 
06:52:48.708 --> 06:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
some a couple good things about this
 
06:52:52.868 --> 06:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill including the por language um
 
06:52:54.708 --> 06:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
but overall i think there's a lot of
 
06:52:57.030 --> 06:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
problems in this bill um let me back up
 
06:52:58.868 --> 06:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
um i am the assistant mayor of the city
 
06:53:00.868 --> 06:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
of lebanon and i am here testifying on
 
06:53:02.788 --> 06:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
behalf of the city of lebanon
 
06:53:05.510 --> 06:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have provided you fairly uh very
 
06:53:08.150 --> 06:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
extensive detailed critique of the bill
 
06:53:09.990 --> 06:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
as well as a couple of suggested
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
amendments that you should all have um i
 
06:53:15.190 --> 06:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
would strongly urge you to take the time
 
06:53:17.590 --> 06:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
to review that i i know it's it's dense
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
and complicated subject but it is um
 
06:53:20.638 --> 06:53:22.150 align:start position:0%
and complicated subject but it is um
uh

06:53:22.150 --> 06:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of important
 
06:53:26.468 --> 06:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
details to get right here um and i'm
 
06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
certainly open to working with the
 
06:53:31.430 --> 06:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors um the utilities the poc other
 
06:53:33.990 --> 06:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
parties uh to um
 
06:53:35.750 --> 06:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
see if we can find some common ground
 
06:53:37.270 --> 06:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
that will actually help move this
 
06:53:39.990 --> 06:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
forward um but i gotta say at this point
 
06:53:41.270 --> 06:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
that you know i think just the
 
06:53:42.948 --> 06:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill is the thing
 
06:53:45.430 --> 06:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
that has held up the puc uh moving ahead
 
06:53:47.510 --> 06:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
with formal rulemaking i'm just
 
06:53:49.910 --> 06:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
speculating i have no knowledge of that
 
06:53:51.670 --> 06:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
except that uh back before the end of
 
06:53:54.468 --> 06:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
the year they expected uh to be
 
06:53:56.708 --> 06:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
proposing um doing the initial rule
 
06:53:58.948 --> 06:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
proposal fairly soon and quite honestly
 
06:54:01.190 --> 06:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
i i thought we were about 90 95 of the
 
06:54:04.230 --> 06:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
way on the rules uh in the informal
 
06:54:06.070 --> 06:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
process um
 
06:54:07.910 --> 06:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know there was certainly an openness
 
06:54:10.230 --> 06:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
for the utilities and any stakeholder to
 
06:54:12.468 --> 06:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
propose a rural language
 
06:54:14.788 --> 06:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
and um we you know we just didn't see
 
06:54:17.190 --> 06:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
the rule language that that you know
 
06:54:19.430 --> 06:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
would perhaps close the gap uh if you
 
06:54:19.440 --> 06:54:20.548 align:start position:0%
would perhaps close the gap uh if you
will

06:54:20.548 --> 06:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:54:20.558 --> 06:54:22.230 align:start position:0%
will
um

06:54:22.230 --> 06:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:26.230 --> 06:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:27.910 --> 06:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
we've probably been at the city of
 
06:54:30.070 --> 06:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
lebanon four and a half years ago
 
06:54:31.590 --> 06:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
designated our lebanon electric
 
06:54:34.070 --> 06:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
aggregation committee um our energy
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
advisory committee as its electric
 
06:54:38.548 --> 06:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
aggregation committee and um
 
06:54:40.788 --> 06:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
that was in the context of the uh
 
06:54:42.310 --> 06:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
development of new net metering tariffs
 
06:54:44.708 --> 06:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
where the city proposed in its testimony
 
06:54:46.868 --> 06:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
that we actually pilot um using
 
06:54:49.110 --> 06:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
real-time prices as a mechanism with
 
06:54:51.110 --> 06:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
regard to net metering uh both for
 
06:54:52.948 --> 06:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
buying and selling electricity at the
 
06:54:55.190 --> 06:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
retail level uh translating the
 
06:54:56.628 --> 06:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
wholesale market price directly to
 
06:54:58.708 --> 06:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
customers new hampshire's that law has
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
actually called for that since 1996 in
 
06:55:03.910 --> 06:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
the restructuring statute uh that says
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
customers should have choices such as
 
06:55:07.750 --> 06:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
access to real-time pricing
 
06:55:09.590 --> 06:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
generally that's just not an option for
 
06:55:10.788 --> 06:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
smaller customers because they don't
 
06:55:13.750 --> 06:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
have the metering capacity for that um
 
06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bill does not the current law does
 
06:55:17.990 --> 06:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
not change a lot of things about the way
 
06:55:20.548 --> 06:55:20.558 align:start position:0%
anything that the utilities work
 
06:55:22.310 --> 06:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
without a process that would have the
 
06:55:25.350 --> 06:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
puc um a finding that it's for the
 
06:55:26.948 --> 06:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
public good whether it's regard with
 
06:55:29.350 --> 06:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
regard to metering or billing or
 
06:55:32.230 --> 06:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
anything else of that nature um and in
 
06:55:35.510 --> 06:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
fact the bill actually repeals or
 
06:55:37.190 --> 06:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
modifies quite a bit of language from
 
06:55:40.150 --> 06:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
the original statute going back to 1996.
 
06:55:42.390 --> 06:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
it does just it doesn't simply undo
 
06:55:46.150 --> 06:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
things uh from two years ago um
 
06:55:48.070 --> 06:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i i i do want to say i think it's
 
06:55:49.590 --> 06:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that
 
06:55:51.030 --> 06:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't see any difference
 
06:55:53.350 --> 06:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
between the terms municipal and county
 
06:55:53.360 --> 06:55:54.548 align:start position:0%
between the terms municipal and county
aggregation

06:55:54.548 --> 06:55:54.558 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
06:55:56.708 --> 06:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh community aggregation
 
06:55:58.468 --> 06:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
uh community or community power or
 
06:56:00.230 --> 06:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
community choice aggregation those those
 
06:56:02.390 --> 06:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
are all terms that are interchangeable
 
06:56:05.670 --> 06:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
um and they're simply about what um
 
06:56:07.510 --> 06:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh the law
 
06:56:09.670 --> 06:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
attempts to enable and what it i think
 
06:56:12.548 --> 06:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
at its core attempts to enable is
 
06:56:14.788 --> 06:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
a more market-based approach to our
 
06:56:17.670 --> 06:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
energy supply uh one that um
 
06:56:19.590 --> 06:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
gives small customers the similar
 
06:56:21.830 --> 06:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities that large customers have
 
06:56:24.868 --> 06:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
today in the competitive market um and
 
06:56:27.830 --> 06:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
that allows for innovation and adaption
 
06:56:30.230 --> 06:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
to local conditions um
 
06:56:33.270 --> 06:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what this bill would undo
 
06:56:34.948 --> 06:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
would would get rid of those things it
 
06:56:36.708 --> 06:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
would get rid of a lot of the
 
06:56:40.070 --> 06:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities to provide value added uh
 
06:56:43.190 --> 06:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
benefits to both local customers and the
 
06:56:46.628 --> 06:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
grid as a whole i would argue um
 
06:56:46.638 --> 06:56:48.310 align:start position:0%
grid as a whole i would argue um
uh

06:56:48.310 --> 06:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:56:49.590 --> 06:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
i know you've got a lot of folks who
 
06:56:52.310 --> 06:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
want to testify i do want to
 
06:56:53.670 --> 06:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
i could go ahead and address
 
06:56:55.110 --> 06:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts one of her
 
06:56:57.430 --> 06:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
concerns about customer data the current
 
06:57:01.430 --> 06:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
law very expressly says that um uh um
 
06:57:03.750 --> 06:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
municipal and county aggregations and
 
06:57:05.430 --> 06:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i use the term community power just
 
06:57:08.628 --> 06:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
as a shorthand for that um uh
 
06:57:10.390 --> 06:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know have the same obligations that
 
06:57:12.788 --> 06:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
utilities have as a service provider
 
06:57:15.030 --> 06:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
because they would be uh
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
serving people's electricity supply
 
06:57:17.760 --> 06:57:18.788 align:start position:0%
serving people's electricity supply
needs

06:57:18.788 --> 06:57:18.798 align:start position:0%
needs
 
06:57:20.548 --> 06:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
as the utilities to protect customer
 
06:57:22.948 --> 06:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
data and it goes a step further and also
 
06:57:24.628 --> 06:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
says that that any of that data is not
 
06:57:27.190 --> 06:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
subject to disclosure under 91a just
 
06:57:28.708 --> 06:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
because there's a historic court case
 
06:57:30.070 --> 06:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
that said
 
06:57:32.070 --> 06:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
information about cni customers would
 
06:57:34.150 --> 06:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
have to be disclosed if it's held by the
 
06:57:35.990 --> 06:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
puc for instance so we want to make
 
06:57:38.548 --> 06:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
clear that this would all still be
 
06:57:41.830 --> 06:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
protected confidential data
 
06:57:43.430 --> 06:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
you mr phil
 
06:57:44.708 --> 06:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:57:46.468 --> 06:57:46.478 align:start position:0%
happy happy to work with the committee
 
06:57:46.478 --> 06:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
happy happy to work with the committee
um

06:57:57.510 --> 06:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:59.030 --> 06:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative oxenham you
 
06:58:01.910 --> 06:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
recognize your question
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr bilo could you
 
06:58:07.510 --> 06:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
go back for a moment to your uh
 
06:58:09.510 --> 06:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
statement that community aggregation and
 
06:58:11.430 --> 06:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
community's choice and
 
06:58:13.190 --> 06:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
there was a third term that they all
 
06:58:14.788 --> 06:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
actually referred to the same thing
 
06:58:17.190 --> 06:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
could you just flesh that out for us
 
06:58:17.200 --> 06:58:19.670 align:start position:0%
could you just flesh that out for us
please

06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:23.350 --> 06:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
i will say the term community power came
 
06:58:25.670 --> 06:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
very in the early days of of our
 
06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee talking about this and say
 
06:58:29.670 --> 06:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
what would we call it um
 
06:58:31.750 --> 06:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we you know played around with
 
06:58:33.990 --> 06:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
lebanon light and power there's a cape
 
06:58:35.270 --> 06:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
light in power
 
06:58:35.280 --> 06:58:36.310 align:start position:0%
light in power
um

06:58:36.310 --> 06:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:58:39.270 --> 06:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know cca is kind of obscure lebanon
 
06:58:40.948 --> 06:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
municipal aggregation didn't sound good
 
06:58:42.390 --> 06:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
so we just said let's call it lebanon
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
community power because we would be
 
06:58:46.868 --> 06:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
supplying the power uh to our customers
 
06:58:48.628 --> 06:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
that's what aggregation is the
 
06:58:51.110 --> 06:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
aggregation is the responsible entity
 
06:58:53.670 --> 06:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
for providing the power supply not
 
06:58:57.190 --> 06:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
delivering it and and um
 
06:58:58.468 --> 06:58:58.478 align:start position:0%
so that's why i don't really think
 
06:59:00.548 --> 06:59:00.558 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction um
 
06:59:03.030 --> 06:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
we did discover that that
 
06:59:05.110 --> 06:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities cannot reserve trade
 
06:59:07.590 --> 06:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
names so we we wrote into the law that
 
06:59:09.830 --> 06:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
communities could reserve the term
 
06:59:12.468 --> 06:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
lebanon or plainfield or nashua
 
06:59:14.468 --> 06:59:14.478 align:start position:0%
community power just so that people
 
06:59:16.230 --> 06:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
could have a name that they could use
 
06:59:18.708 --> 06:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
reliably and consistently
 
06:59:22.948 --> 06:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
06:59:27.830 --> 06:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
06:59:30.310 --> 06:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'll take the follow-up um could
 
06:59:31.910 --> 06:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
could you explain
 
06:59:34.468 --> 06:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
why when we were presented with this
 
06:59:36.628 --> 06:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
bill by the sponsor we were told there
 
06:59:39.350 --> 06:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
are two separate things and it's
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
possible for community aggregation to go
 
06:59:45.430 --> 06:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
forward and we should not be held up by
 
06:59:48.310 --> 06:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
all these other issues that are
 
06:59:50.310 --> 06:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
holding things up
 
06:59:52.230 --> 06:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
well i'm afraid the bill is introduced
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure this was not the intent of
 
06:59:56.070 --> 06:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsors but but um
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
the effect of some of the language that
 
07:00:00.230 --> 07:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
was provided to them by eversource
 
07:00:02.948 --> 07:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
was to make basically
 
07:00:04.708 --> 07:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
community aggregation municipal and
 
07:00:08.070 --> 07:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
county aggregation impossible to do um
 
07:00:09.750 --> 07:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh you might as well repeal the whole
 
07:00:11.750 --> 07:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
statute and if you wonder why you just
 
07:00:13.830 --> 07:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
you need to read through my detailed uh
 
07:00:15.270 --> 07:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
explanation of this in my written
 
07:00:17.350 --> 07:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
comments um
 
07:00:17.360 --> 07:00:18.230 align:start position:0%
comments um
uh

07:00:18.230 --> 07:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:00:19.510 --> 07:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
i guess that's it
 
07:00:21.830 --> 07:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
but well i i i have read all of your
 
07:00:26.708 --> 07:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:26.718 --> 07:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:00:27.510 --> 07:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
i really had your follow-up excuse me
 
07:00:31.190 --> 07:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay i'll go on to representative mcgee
 
07:00:33.510 --> 07:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
please for a question
 
07:00:36.310 --> 07:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you mr vice chair and
 
07:00:38.708 --> 07:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr vilo for coming here today
 
07:00:41.990 --> 07:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
um i i did read through um your notes
 
07:00:42.000 --> 07:00:42.948 align:start position:0%
um i i did read through um your notes
and

07:00:42.948 --> 07:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:00:44.708 --> 07:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to refer to when you were
 
07:00:46.468 --> 07:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
testifying you mentioned that there's
 
07:00:48.150 --> 07:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
already an existing process through
 
07:00:51.030 --> 07:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
which the puc oversees the billing the
 
07:00:52.948 --> 07:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
metering um
 
07:00:54.788 --> 07:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
the pieces of the process that seem to
 
07:00:58.390 --> 07:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
be um redefined in the bill
 
07:01:00.468 --> 07:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
language and i was just curious if you
 
07:01:01.750 --> 07:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
could say a little bit more about that
 
07:01:03.990 --> 07:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
so that we could understand that piece
 
07:01:04.000 --> 07:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
so that we could understand that piece
better

07:01:05.750 --> 07:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
07:01:05.760 --> 07:01:06.548 align:start position:0%
better
well

07:01:06.548 --> 07:01:06.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:01:08.788 --> 07:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
um you know the bill would strike for
 
07:01:11.030 --> 07:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
instance some of the authority that has
 
07:01:13.830 --> 07:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
existed since 1996
 
07:01:13.840 --> 07:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
existed since 1996
for

07:01:15.030 --> 07:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:01:17.030 --> 07:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
a municipal aggregation
 
07:01:20.070 --> 07:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
to provide customer service or meter
 
07:01:22.868 --> 07:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
reading or other related services
 
07:01:25.430 --> 07:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
or conservation and decide demand side
 
07:01:28.390 --> 07:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
management um it takes those first the
 
07:01:30.230 --> 07:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
the last two i just mentioned and says
 
07:01:32.070 --> 07:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
you can only do it through the utility
 
07:01:34.390 --> 07:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
or ice on new england programs which
 
07:01:37.190 --> 07:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
makes no sense because today
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
third party providers do all kinds of
 
07:01:41.110 --> 07:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
demand side management i point to one
 
07:01:43.270 --> 07:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
that freedom energy logistics has helped
 
07:01:45.510 --> 07:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
the city save tens and tens of thousands
 
07:01:47.590 --> 07:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
of dollars we'd like to be able to
 
07:01:49.990 --> 07:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
continue to do that in working with
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
these uh vendors um you know even meter
 
07:01:56.310 --> 07:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
reading it you know right now there's
 
07:01:58.070 --> 07:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
two forms of meter reading that
 
07:02:00.708 --> 07:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
third-party vendors can do uh you have
 
07:02:02.390 --> 07:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
your independent monitors for reading
 
07:02:04.230 --> 07:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
the production meters for wreck
 
07:02:06.230 --> 07:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
production that is something we would
 
07:02:07.910 --> 07:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
like to be able to offer to smaller
 
07:02:07.920 --> 07:02:08.948 align:start position:0%
like to be able to offer to smaller
customers

07:02:08.948 --> 07:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
customers
 
07:02:10.708 --> 07:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
this would a language would prohibit
 
07:02:10.718 --> 07:02:12.070 align:start position:0%
this would a language would prohibit
that

07:02:12.070 --> 07:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:02:14.868 --> 07:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
all suppliers competitive suppliers many
 
07:02:16.628 --> 07:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
of them provide their own customer
 
07:02:18.788 --> 07:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
service when customers have questions
 
07:02:20.868 --> 07:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
about their supply
 
07:02:22.468 --> 07:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't a community power
 
07:02:24.390 --> 07:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
aggregation be able to provide customer
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
service particularly if we're doing
 
07:02:27.510 --> 07:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
something innovative like offering
 
07:02:29.990 --> 07:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
customers access to real-time pricing
 
07:02:31.750 --> 07:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
utility may not know anything about our
 
07:02:33.910 --> 07:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
real-time pricing program we should be
 
07:02:35.590 --> 07:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
the ones who are able to answer customer
 
07:02:37.830 --> 07:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
questions about that not apparently have
 
07:02:40.070 --> 07:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
to contract oh we couldn't even contract
 
07:02:41.270 --> 07:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
with utility because it wouldn't even
 
07:02:43.510 --> 07:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
allow us to contract with anybody for
 
07:02:45.590 --> 07:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
customer service so we just couldn't do
 
07:02:47.110 --> 07:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
customer service
 
07:02:49.510 --> 07:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
there's just many things about what the
 
07:02:51.910 --> 07:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill does that i just don't understand
 
07:02:54.868 --> 07:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
why and and when you look at the bill
 
07:02:56.708 --> 07:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
itself they're not obvious because many
 
07:02:59.270 --> 07:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill are a repeal and
 
07:03:01.670 --> 07:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
reenactment and so that is why i've
 
07:03:04.310 --> 07:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
provided you attachment a which goes
 
07:03:07.270 --> 07:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
through the entire rsa 53e and shows how
 
07:03:09.190 --> 07:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
it would be changed and you can also go
 
07:03:11.590 --> 07:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
back to my attachment c and see how it
 
07:03:14.310 --> 07:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
changed two years ago including detailed
 
07:03:16.830 --> 07:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
explanation for the why of each of those
 
07:03:19.190 --> 07:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
changes well thank you i would like to
 
07:03:20.788 --> 07:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for all the work that you did
 
07:03:23.190 --> 07:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
because it is really difficult you do
 
07:03:27.350 --> 07:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
need a decoder to figure out changes um
 
07:03:29.830 --> 07:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
and to that end i think you know it
 
07:03:31.910 --> 07:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
brings me back to the question of the
 
07:03:35.030 --> 07:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
objectives which i think for us as
 
07:03:36.948 --> 07:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
policy makers
 
07:03:39.270 --> 07:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
we should probably have clear a clear
 
07:03:40.868 --> 07:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we're trying to
 
07:03:40.878 --> 07:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we're trying to
achieve

07:03:41.990 --> 07:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
07:03:44.868 --> 07:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
with changes and start there and then
 
07:03:46.548 --> 07:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
understand whether the changes that
 
07:03:48.230 --> 07:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
we're making achieve those objectives
 
07:03:50.310 --> 07:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that clearly laid out
 
07:03:51.910 --> 07:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
here either i think it's
 
07:03:54.390 --> 07:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
um really hard for us to
 
07:03:57.510 --> 07:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
say sure go do this when it it has uh
 
07:03:59.750 --> 07:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
such significant implications apparently
 
07:04:01.990 --> 07:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh to people's planning
 
07:04:04.230 --> 07:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
but thank you i appreciate your wealth
 
07:04:05.910 --> 07:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
and knowledge
 
07:04:06.788 --> 07:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:04:07.830 --> 07:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:04:09.510 --> 07:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
07:04:11.750 --> 07:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
if i may remind the members to please
 
07:04:13.670 --> 07:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
request a follow-up
 
07:04:16.150 --> 07:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
instead of just talking please thank you
 
07:04:18.310 --> 07:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize representative
 
07:04:20.468 --> 07:04:20.478 align:start position:0%
resny right now for a question
 
07:04:22.150 --> 07:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman and thank you mr
 
07:04:24.708 --> 07:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
villa for your testimony you mentioned
 
07:04:26.788 --> 07:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
meter reading and customer service as
 
07:04:28.868 --> 07:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
some of the services that community
 
07:04:31.110 --> 07:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
power would offer can you
 
07:04:33.830 --> 07:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
explain any other services that
 
07:04:36.230 --> 07:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
community power would would provide to
 
07:04:38.070 --> 07:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
the resident to the ratepayers
 
07:04:41.590 --> 07:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
and also how that
 
07:04:43.110 --> 07:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
squares with
 
07:04:45.670 --> 07:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
it being duplicate services that the uh
 
07:04:48.070 --> 07:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
that the utilities can also provide or
 
07:04:50.230 --> 07:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
how the committee power can provide
 
07:04:52.548 --> 07:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
those better
 
07:04:56.390 --> 07:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
or more efficiently thank you
 
07:04:59.590 --> 07:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
sorry i muted myself um i think a basic
 
07:05:01.830 --> 07:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
um sort of criteria in terms of thinking
 
07:05:03.670 --> 07:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
about these things is
 
07:05:05.750 --> 07:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
are these natural monopolies that should
 
07:05:07.510 --> 07:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
only be provided by
 
07:05:10.310 --> 07:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
the electric distribution utility or are
 
07:05:13.510 --> 07:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
these things that can be or should be
 
07:05:17.030 --> 07:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
open to competition and market options
 
07:05:19.510 --> 07:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
customer choice and community choice
 
07:05:19.520 --> 07:05:21.430 align:start position:0%
customer choice and community choice
and

07:05:21.430 --> 07:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:05:23.270 --> 07:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a whole range of
 
07:05:23.280 --> 07:05:25.190 align:start position:0%
so there's a whole range of
possibilities

07:05:25.190 --> 07:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
07:05:25.200 --> 07:05:26.468 align:start position:0%
possibilities
on

07:05:26.468 --> 07:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:05:27.910 --> 07:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
there is a piece of this that
 
07:05:33.590 --> 07:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
wants we want to be enabled to provide
 
07:05:36.310 --> 07:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
customers with interval metering so that
 
07:05:39.670 --> 07:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
they can access temporal price signals
 
07:05:41.350 --> 07:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
07:05:43.350 --> 07:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of long overdue in new
 
07:05:46.468 --> 07:05:46.478 align:start position:0%
hampshire um unitil and the co-op have
 
07:05:48.150 --> 07:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
already have that kind of metering in
 
07:05:50.070 --> 07:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
place our utility is moving in that
 
07:05:52.868 --> 07:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
direction we've been engaged in dialogue
 
07:05:55.510 --> 07:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
with liberty as to how we could do that
 
07:05:57.990 --> 07:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
and one option that just was a natural
 
07:05:59.990 --> 07:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
is we pay for the additional cost to
 
07:06:01.830 --> 07:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
upgrade the meters they have meter
 
07:06:05.110 --> 07:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
options uh to provide an upgraded meter
 
07:06:07.830 --> 07:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
that could do this once you do that then
 
07:06:09.350 --> 07:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
the customer there's this thing called
 
07:06:11.510 --> 07:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
capacity tag and that is part of the
 
07:06:13.910 --> 07:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
underlying charge in energy electricity
 
07:06:17.430 --> 07:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
supply it's it's it's based on each
 
07:06:20.070 --> 07:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
customers theoretically their share of
 
07:06:22.390 --> 07:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
the coincident peak demand for the
 
07:06:26.788 --> 07:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
highest demand hour of the entire year
 
07:06:28.468 --> 07:06:28.478 align:start position:0%
and right now
 
07:06:29.750 --> 07:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
people get their
 
07:06:32.150 --> 07:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
capacity tagged based on their class
 
07:06:34.230 --> 07:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
average load shape unless they have
 
07:06:35.830 --> 07:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
interval metering
 
07:06:37.510 --> 07:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
so for the city we only have two
 
07:06:39.510 --> 07:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
accounts our two largest accounts about
 
07:06:41.830 --> 07:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
40 of the totals city electricity
 
07:06:45.030 --> 07:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
consumption uh our water treatment and
 
07:06:47.350 --> 07:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
our wastewater treatment plants so we
 
07:06:50.230 --> 07:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
had fairly high capacity tags for those
 
07:06:51.910 --> 07:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
and working with freedom energy
 
07:06:54.150 --> 07:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
logistics we put them on a first of we
 
07:06:56.868 --> 07:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
put them on a real-time pricing product
 
07:06:58.628 --> 07:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
which is saving money just in and of
 
07:07:01.830 --> 07:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
itself and then they also helped us do
 
07:07:04.070 --> 07:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
load management outside of any utility
 
07:07:04.080 --> 07:07:05.190 align:start position:0%
load management outside of any utility
program

07:07:05.190 --> 07:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:07:07.190 --> 07:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
to say okay we think there's going to be
 
07:07:09.670 --> 07:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
a coincident peace demand between three
 
07:07:11.670 --> 07:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and six o'clock this coming you know
 
07:07:14.868 --> 07:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow try to curtail your load so we
 
07:07:16.708 --> 07:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
have done that for three years in a row
 
07:07:18.948 --> 07:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
this year because we had some fairly
 
07:07:21.110 --> 07:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
modest sized solar systems that mostly
 
07:07:23.670 --> 07:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
served the load behind those plants the
 
07:07:25.750 --> 07:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
plant operators had gotten pretty
 
07:07:27.750 --> 07:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
sophisticated about how they could turn
 
07:07:29.430 --> 07:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
down the power consumption at those
 
07:07:32.468 --> 07:07:32.478 align:start position:0%
large industrial size loads
 
07:07:35.670 --> 07:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we managed to zero out our capacity
 
07:07:37.910 --> 07:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
tags for next year between the hour and
 
07:07:39.590 --> 07:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
five and six
 
07:07:43.030 --> 07:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
five and six pm on a july afternoon
 
07:07:45.510 --> 07:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
we reduced our energy consumption at our
 
07:07:47.430 --> 07:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
water treatment and wastewater treatment
 
07:07:49.590 --> 07:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
plants so that we were serving 100
 
07:07:51.750 --> 07:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
of that load by our on-site solar that
 
07:07:53.670 --> 07:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
late in the afternoon and we're
 
07:07:55.590 --> 07:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
exporting power to the grid that
 
07:07:57.270 --> 07:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
benefits everyone because it means we
 
07:07:58.868 --> 07:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
don't have to buy as much capacity in
 
07:08:01.430 --> 07:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
the future to meet peak demand and the
 
07:08:03.430 --> 07:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
whole grid has to be sized to meet the
 
07:08:05.830 --> 07:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
highest load so if we can shave the peak
 
07:08:07.910 --> 07:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
take some of that load off peak it
 
07:08:09.910 --> 07:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
actually means we're spreading the cost
 
07:08:12.548 --> 07:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
over fewer costs over more kilowatt
 
07:08:14.070 --> 07:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
hours and help lower the price for
 
07:08:16.310 --> 07:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
everyone we want to be able to do that
 
07:08:18.310 --> 07:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
for smaller customers who don't have
 
07:08:20.548 --> 07:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
access to that now but but the way the
 
07:08:22.150 --> 07:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill's written it wouldn't even allow us
 
07:08:24.868 --> 07:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
to do it for the large customers our own
 
07:08:27.510 --> 07:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
city account so
 
07:08:29.430 --> 07:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
if if you hear some frustration from me
 
07:08:31.990 --> 07:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
it is because i have been down in the
 
07:08:34.230 --> 07:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
weeds on these issues for a quarter of a
 
07:08:35.990 --> 07:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
century and
 
07:08:38.150 --> 07:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's so much opportunity to produce
 
07:08:40.390 --> 07:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
value and savings you know just an
 
07:08:42.628 --> 07:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
example of that is is is helping
 
07:08:44.948 --> 07:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
customers think about battery storage
 
07:08:47.510 --> 07:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the same kind of purpose and and we
 
07:08:49.030 --> 07:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
see this as an opportunity to make
 
07:08:51.350 --> 07:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
communities and the citizens of those
 
07:08:52.868 --> 07:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
communities real partners with the
 
07:08:55.350 --> 07:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities in terms of
 
07:08:56.708 --> 07:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
timing doing the kinds of grid
 
07:08:59.590 --> 07:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
modernization and the kind of new
 
07:09:01.670 --> 07:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
options for customers that can actually
 
07:09:03.430 --> 07:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
produce value and savings for the whole
 
07:09:05.350 --> 07:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
system um so
 
07:09:07.910 --> 07:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
rational question uh thank you very much
 
07:09:09.830 --> 07:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move on now to uh
 
07:09:12.390 --> 07:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative has a question he just
 
07:09:14.070 --> 07:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
answered on the
 
07:09:15.430 --> 07:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
question i was going to ask himself who
 
07:09:16.788 --> 07:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
was paying for the customer service and
 
07:09:18.788 --> 07:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
the meter reading that he talked about
 
07:09:20.468 --> 07:09:20.478 align:start position:0%
he has given the answer in his last
 
07:09:23.910 --> 07:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
little spiel okay thank you uh see no
 
07:09:25.510 --> 07:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
other hands raised
 
07:09:26.868 --> 07:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere around
 
07:09:28.548 --> 07:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony mr
 
07:09:30.468 --> 07:09:30.478 align:start position:0%
barrow thank you
 
07:09:32.548 --> 07:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to the next speaker
 
07:09:34.310 --> 07:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
which would be uh
 
07:09:37.510 --> 07:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
mr don price for our office of consumer
 
07:09:39.190 --> 07:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
advocate mr
 
07:09:46.390 --> 07:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:48.070 --> 07:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
07:09:49.830 --> 07:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
07:09:49.840 --> 07:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
testify

07:09:51.030 --> 07:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
testify
 
07:09:53.270 --> 07:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh as you all know i
 
07:09:54.948 --> 07:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
am the head of the office of the
 
07:09:56.468 --> 07:09:56.478 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate i represent
 
07:09:59.030 --> 07:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers
 
07:10:00.708 --> 07:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to take up very much of
 
07:10:01.830 --> 07:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
your time
 
07:10:04.788 --> 07:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
i agree with everything i heard
 
07:10:07.430 --> 07:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh assistant mayor belo and before him
 
07:10:09.590 --> 07:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
mr frohmath of freedom energy logistics
 
07:10:09.600 --> 07:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
mr frohmath of freedom energy logistics
say

07:10:11.030 --> 07:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
07:10:14.628 --> 07:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
i oppose house bill 315
 
07:10:16.230 --> 07:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
i think the most sensible thing to do
 
07:10:18.070 --> 07:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the bill is to retain it because i
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
agree that there are certain discussions
 
07:10:23.350 --> 07:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
that ought to take place that would lead
 
07:10:23.360 --> 07:10:24.150 align:start position:0%
that ought to take place that would lead
to

07:10:24.150 --> 07:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:10:26.468 --> 07:10:26.478 align:start position:0%
perhaps the refinement of community
 
07:10:29.110 --> 07:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
power aggregation as a concept it's very
 
07:10:30.788 --> 07:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
gratified to hear
 
07:10:32.628 --> 07:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
assistant mayor below say that he
 
07:10:34.390 --> 07:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand or recognize a
 
07:10:37.830 --> 07:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
distinction between community power uh
 
07:10:40.230 --> 07:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
or community aggregation and community
 
07:10:42.468 --> 07:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
power because i don't think i understand
 
07:10:45.190 --> 07:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
or discern any distinction between those
 
07:10:46.788 --> 07:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
two things either
 
07:10:49.510 --> 07:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
either in law or in fact
 
07:10:52.390 --> 07:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
i want to use my limited time to ask you
 
07:10:55.110 --> 07:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
to think and i i suggested this in my
 
07:10:57.590 --> 07:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony about what the real
 
07:10:59.990 --> 07:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of electric industry
 
07:11:03.030 --> 07:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
restructuring was in 1996 and what it
 
07:11:05.270 --> 07:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
remains today the question that i think
 
07:11:07.670 --> 07:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature needs to ask itself is
 
07:11:09.590 --> 07:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
do you want to protect default service
 
07:11:10.948 --> 07:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
or do you want to protect and help
 
07:11:13.030 --> 07:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
consumers if you want to protect and
 
07:11:15.830 --> 07:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
help default service and make sure that
 
07:11:18.468 --> 07:11:18.478 align:start position:0%
residential customers are perpetually
 
07:11:20.868 --> 07:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
tethered to default service as provided
 
07:11:23.030 --> 07:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
by the utilities then you really
 
07:11:24.708 --> 07:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't like community power
 
07:11:27.670 --> 07:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
aggregation because it really does posit
 
07:11:30.548 --> 07:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
or present itself as a legitimate rival
 
07:11:33.190 --> 07:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
to default service and it really does
 
07:11:35.270 --> 07:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
have the potential to cause lots and
 
07:11:37.750 --> 07:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
lots of residential customers to migrate
 
07:11:39.830 --> 07:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
away from total dependence on
 
07:11:41.350 --> 07:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
on the utility
 
07:11:43.990 --> 07:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
into combining their demand with their
 
07:11:44.000 --> 07:11:45.030 align:start position:0%
into combining their demand with their
neighbors

07:11:45.030 --> 07:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
07:11:45.040 --> 07:11:45.910 align:start position:0%
neighbors
and

07:11:45.910 --> 07:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:11:48.390 --> 07:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
being part of a
 
07:11:51.510 --> 07:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
very potent and compelling alternative
 
07:11:55.110 --> 07:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
to default service but as i suggested uh
 
07:11:57.750 --> 07:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
even the new hampshire supreme court has
 
07:11:59.910 --> 07:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the purpose of the
 
07:12:02.150 --> 07:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
restructuring act as essentially
 
07:12:04.310 --> 07:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
protecting default service and trying to
 
07:12:06.150 --> 07:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that default service is as
 
07:12:08.708 --> 07:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
cheap as it possibly can be
 
07:12:10.788 --> 07:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
i will deem restructuring to have been
 
07:12:13.430 --> 07:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
successful when i see residential
 
07:12:15.830 --> 07:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
customers migrating away from default
 
07:12:19.350 --> 07:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
service in droves so that they can rely
 
07:12:22.628 --> 07:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
on the non-regulated market
 
07:12:24.948 --> 07:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
to get them the best deals that they can
 
07:12:27.190 --> 07:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
and that would tend to cause default
 
07:12:28.948 --> 07:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
service to wither on the vine i actually
 
07:12:31.030 --> 07:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a sign of success of
 
07:12:34.548 --> 07:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
restructuring and so for those reasons i
 
07:12:37.430 --> 07:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
urge you not to nurture default service
 
07:12:39.830 --> 07:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
i urge you to nurture community power
 
07:12:42.708 --> 07:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
aggregation i think that's uh all i'm
 
07:12:44.230 --> 07:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
going to say because i'm sure there are
 
07:12:46.788 --> 07:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
lots of witnesses who have more
 
07:12:48.788 --> 07:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
substantive and useful things to say
 
07:12:53.190 --> 07:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:54.868 --> 07:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chris i see your
 
07:12:56.468 --> 07:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
representative santosh has been signed
 
07:13:03.830 --> 07:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:03.840 --> 07:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:13:05.030 --> 07:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:13:06.948 --> 07:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
yes sorry
 
07:13:09.110 --> 07:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
07:13:11.590 --> 07:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
mr crease for taking my question my
 
07:13:14.468 --> 07:13:14.478 align:start position:0%
question is pretty simple
 
07:13:16.788 --> 07:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
why do you think that the industrial and
 
07:13:19.990 --> 07:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
commercial users have migrated away from
 
07:13:22.868 --> 07:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
default service and ordinary residents
 
07:13:25.030 --> 07:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
have not
 
07:13:27.110 --> 07:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative samsit for
 
07:13:28.548 --> 07:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
that question i think the answer is
 
07:13:30.788 --> 07:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious um commercial and
 
07:13:32.868 --> 07:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
industrial customers are bigger than
 
07:13:35.190 --> 07:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
residential customers and so if you are
 
07:13:38.628 --> 07:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
a major manufacturer or a major employer
 
07:13:41.190 --> 07:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
or a major business entity you are far
 
07:13:44.150 --> 07:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
more attractive to competitive suppliers
 
07:13:46.868 --> 07:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
than you or i are as individual
 
07:13:48.868 --> 07:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
residential customers so
 
07:13:51.030 --> 07:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh so and and you know we've seen this
 
07:13:52.628 --> 07:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
in every state i think that is
 
07:13:55.190 --> 07:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
restructured the cni the commercial and
 
07:13:57.270 --> 07:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
industrial customers they sought
 
07:13:58.948 --> 07:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
restructuring because they knew they
 
07:14:01.430 --> 07:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
would benefit they have benefited and
 
07:14:03.430 --> 07:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the benefits have not yet accrued to
 
07:14:04.868 --> 07:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
residential customers here in new
 
07:14:04.878 --> 07:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
residential customers here in new
hampshire

07:14:05.910 --> 07:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:14:07.750 --> 07:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
in fact if anything they have fared
 
07:14:09.350 --> 07:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
worse because
 
07:14:09.360 --> 07:14:10.310 align:start position:0%
worse because
uh

07:14:10.310 --> 07:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:14:10.320 --> 07:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh
the

07:14:11.430 --> 07:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:14:13.110 --> 07:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
07:14:15.670 --> 07:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
non-regulated competitive providers that
 
07:14:15.680 --> 07:14:16.548 align:start position:0%
non-regulated competitive providers that
have

07:14:16.548 --> 07:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:14:18.868 --> 07:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
reached out to residential customers
 
07:14:21.910 --> 07:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
tend to be the bottom feeding entities
 
07:14:24.628 --> 07:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
that like to take advantage of people
 
07:14:30.628 --> 07:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:33.830 --> 07:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see any other hands up
 
07:14:38.948 --> 07:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:40.310 --> 07:14:40.320 align:start position:0%

i want to say that nashua is one of a
 
07:15:40.150 --> 07:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
whole series of communities and counties
 
07:15:43.190 --> 07:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
that are interested in community power
 
07:15:45.270 --> 07:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
or aggregation
 
07:15:48.150 --> 07:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
we are actively working with
 
07:15:50.310 --> 07:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
cheshire county rockingham county
 
07:15:52.868 --> 07:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
lebanon hanover
 
07:15:56.230 --> 07:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
and other communities and uh formally
 
07:15:59.350 --> 07:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
and talking with cities across the state
 
07:15:59.360 --> 07:16:00.390 align:start position:0%
and talking with cities across the state
about

07:16:00.390 --> 07:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:16:02.310 --> 07:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
this opportunity
 
07:16:03.910 --> 07:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh so there are a lot of people
 
07:16:05.830 --> 07:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
interested in this and as is already
 
07:16:07.910 --> 07:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
stated the underlying purpose is to
 
07:16:07.920 --> 07:16:09.510 align:start position:0%
stated the underlying purpose is to
promote

07:16:09.510 --> 07:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
promote
 
07:16:09.520 --> 07:16:11.190 align:start position:0%
promote
competition

07:16:11.190 --> 07:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
competition
 
07:16:12.468 --> 07:16:12.478 align:start position:0%
now the
 
07:16:14.868 --> 07:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
i want to we're second what you've heard
 
07:16:17.430 --> 07:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
from i think mr from the consumer
 
07:16:19.990 --> 07:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
advocate mr bilo that
 
07:16:22.788 --> 07:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
the i the concept of separating
 
07:16:24.948 --> 07:16:24.958 align:start position:0%
community power from community
 
07:16:24.958 --> 07:16:26.468 align:start position:0%
community power from community
aggregation

07:16:26.468 --> 07:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
07:16:28.868 --> 07:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
is creating more confusion
 
07:16:31.190 --> 07:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
than help and is causing delay
 
07:16:33.750 --> 07:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh not moving the the matter forward
 
07:16:36.628 --> 07:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
there we don't see the difference
 
07:16:39.430 --> 07:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
there are it is the same thing
 
07:16:41.830 --> 07:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh certainly different little
 
07:16:43.670 --> 07:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
bells and whistles could be included
 
07:16:46.548 --> 07:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
within aggregation community power but
 
07:16:49.910 --> 07:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
there is no distinction between the two
 
07:16:52.310 --> 07:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh second i i want a second when mr
 
07:16:56.070 --> 07:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
below said that 315 if you pass all and
 
07:16:57.830 --> 07:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
even the amended version
 
07:16:59.430 --> 07:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
at least the way we look at this you
 
07:17:01.830 --> 07:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
pass that and you might as well just
 
07:17:02.830 --> 07:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:17:05.510 --> 07:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
eradicate uh the the all the efforts
 
07:17:07.190 --> 07:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
have been made in the past because this
 
07:17:09.110 --> 07:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
will essentially
 
07:17:11.110 --> 07:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh kill community power
 
07:17:15.190 --> 07:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
or aggregation both of them same thing
 
07:17:15.200 --> 07:17:16.150 align:start position:0%
or aggregation both of them same thing
so

07:17:16.150 --> 07:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:17:19.030 --> 07:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
i have been on these calls with the puc
 
07:17:21.510 --> 07:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert in this
 
07:17:22.390 --> 07:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:17:24.868 --> 07:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh and have just been mostly listening
 
07:17:26.788 --> 07:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
to the discussion
 
07:17:29.350 --> 07:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
but there are i think several main
 
07:17:32.788 --> 07:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
issues which seem to be stumbling blocks
 
07:17:34.628 --> 07:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
number one as you've already heard the
 
07:17:36.070 --> 07:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
window when
 
07:17:38.070 --> 07:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
community power
 
07:17:38.080 --> 07:17:39.590 align:start position:0%
community power
organizations

07:17:39.590 --> 07:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
07:17:42.070 --> 07:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
wish can buy power
 
07:17:42.080 --> 07:17:44.230 align:start position:0%
wish can buy power
the

07:17:44.230 --> 07:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:17:45.750 --> 07:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
aggregators community power
 
07:17:48.230 --> 07:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
organizations the communities want to be
 
07:17:51.270 --> 07:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
able to buy power when it is best in the
 
07:17:51.280 --> 07:17:52.230 align:start position:0%
able to buy power when it is best in the
market

07:17:52.230 --> 07:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
market
 
07:17:54.548 --> 07:17:54.558 align:start position:0%
i think the utilities eversource has
 
07:17:56.468 --> 07:17:56.478 align:start position:0%
taken the position that
 
07:17:59.430 --> 07:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
they want to require that we go into the
 
07:18:02.150 --> 07:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
market at the same time they do now of
 
07:18:04.708 --> 07:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
course that would have the effect of
 
07:18:07.510 --> 07:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know basically uh you know undermine
 
07:18:10.628 --> 07:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
the competitive aspect of allowing us to
 
07:18:13.670 --> 07:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
be nimble and try to get power at the
 
07:18:16.070 --> 07:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
cheapest possible price
 
07:18:18.948 --> 07:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
number two there's this issue of the
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
the billing
 
07:18:22.788 --> 07:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh we need um
 
07:18:25.590 --> 07:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
we anybody who's going to embark on
 
07:18:28.548 --> 07:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
aggregation is going to need customer
 
07:18:31.270 --> 07:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
information from
 
07:18:32.948 --> 07:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
07:18:35.270 --> 07:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
and of course that the confidentiality
 
07:18:37.670 --> 07:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
of that confidentiality of that would be
 
07:18:37.680 --> 07:18:38.948 align:start position:0%
of that confidentiality of that would be
protected

07:18:38.948 --> 07:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
protected
 
07:18:41.670 --> 07:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh just like the utility protects it but
 
07:18:44.150 --> 07:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to need it to
 
07:18:46.310 --> 07:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
figure out who the customers even are
 
07:18:46.320 --> 07:18:49.430 align:start position:0%
figure out who the customers even are
and

07:18:49.430 --> 07:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:51.910 --> 07:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
determine uh you know who would be in
 
07:18:53.270 --> 07:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
the program
 
07:18:55.190 --> 07:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
for example there are apartment
 
07:18:57.190 --> 07:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
complexes with hundreds of residents we
 
07:18:59.190 --> 07:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
have no idea who's who lives there the
 
07:19:01.270 --> 07:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
city doesn't have a record of who lives
 
07:19:03.910 --> 07:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
in apartment 203 we might know who the
 
07:19:06.310 --> 07:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
owner of the complex is but
 
07:19:09.190 --> 07:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
not not the individual residents
 
07:19:11.110 --> 07:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
and even if we were required to for
 
07:19:13.510 --> 07:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
single-family homes to require to to
 
07:19:14.708 --> 07:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
rely on
 
07:19:17.590 --> 07:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
tax information that's possible but
 
07:19:19.270 --> 07:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
still far more difficult than just
 
07:19:19.280 --> 07:19:20.310 align:start position:0%
still far more difficult than just
getting

07:19:20.310 --> 07:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
getting
 
07:19:22.948 --> 07:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
detailed information from the utilities
 
07:19:24.390 --> 07:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
and third
 
07:19:25.750 --> 07:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
07:19:27.350 --> 07:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
07:19:28.948 --> 07:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt-out
 
07:19:28.958 --> 07:19:30.150 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt-out
uh

07:19:30.150 --> 07:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:19:32.070 --> 07:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
issue which mr from
 
07:19:34.468 --> 07:19:34.478 align:start position:0%
uh discussed is very important
 
07:19:37.350 --> 07:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you have an opt-in
 
07:19:40.150 --> 07:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
the if you change this system from opt
 
07:19:40.160 --> 07:19:41.190 align:start position:0%
the if you change this system from opt
out

07:19:41.190 --> 07:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
07:19:43.510 --> 07:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
in other words community power comes
 
07:19:45.430 --> 07:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
customers have to opt out if you change
 
07:19:47.270 --> 07:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that to opt-in then you
 
07:19:49.350 --> 07:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
greatly reduce the
 
07:19:51.190 --> 07:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
ability of the
 
07:19:51.200 --> 07:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
ability of the
aggregation

07:19:53.110 --> 07:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
07:19:55.990 --> 07:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
organization community power aggregator
 
07:19:56.000 --> 07:19:56.948 align:start position:0%
organization community power aggregator
to

07:19:56.948 --> 07:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:19:59.110 --> 07:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
attract customers because of course
 
07:20:01.270 --> 07:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
residential customers would be skeptical
 
07:20:03.270 --> 07:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
about any change and
 
07:20:05.350 --> 07:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
we need the opt out
 
07:20:07.270 --> 07:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
approach that's already been adopted by
 
07:20:09.590 --> 07:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature that's what has been
 
07:20:12.150 --> 07:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
enacted already that's the approach that
 
07:20:14.468 --> 07:20:14.478 align:start position:0%
means makes the most sense
 
07:20:17.830 --> 07:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think those are the major issues but
 
07:20:19.750 --> 07:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to give the
 
07:20:21.670 --> 07:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
committee a little more perspective of
 
07:20:24.708 --> 07:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
kind of a lay lay person's
 
07:20:26.868 --> 07:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
understanding of all this because uh mr
 
07:20:30.390 --> 07:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
bilo mr from uh the consumer advocate
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
have far more technical knowledge than
 
07:20:36.230 --> 07:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:38.150 --> 07:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair and if you have questions of
 
07:20:40.628 --> 07:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
course i'd be glad to answer them
 
07:20:40.638 --> 07:20:42.468 align:start position:0%
course i'd be glad to answer them
uh

07:20:42.468 --> 07:20:42.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:20:44.868 --> 07:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
i call i see uh representative kerry
 
07:20:49.350 --> 07:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:51.350 --> 07:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am man don't just thank you for
 
07:20:54.468 --> 07:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
taking my question would your program is
 
07:20:56.788 --> 07:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
as you're thinking about
 
07:20:59.670 --> 07:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation
 
07:21:02.468 --> 07:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
would your program be exclusive or would
 
07:21:04.468 --> 07:21:04.478 align:start position:0%
you exclude
 
07:21:07.590 --> 07:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
customers perhaps who had
 
07:21:07.600 --> 07:21:08.788 align:start position:0%
customers perhaps who had
uh

07:21:08.788 --> 07:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:21:10.948 --> 07:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
late bill pays or hadn't paid their
 
07:21:12.310 --> 07:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
bills or
 
07:21:14.788 --> 07:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
would it be anybody in the community who
 
07:21:18.708 --> 07:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
wants to get into the program
 
07:21:20.150 --> 07:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
well again um
 
07:21:20.160 --> 07:21:21.030 align:start position:0%
well again um
my

07:21:21.030 --> 07:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
07:21:23.430 --> 07:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying that
 
07:21:25.670 --> 07:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
the city's energy manager whose name is
 
07:21:27.910 --> 07:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
doria brown is on this call as well and
 
07:21:30.868 --> 07:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
is lined up to testify later
 
07:21:33.590 --> 07:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay on technical issues you know very
 
07:21:35.430 --> 07:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
detailed issues such as the one you've
 
07:21:37.670 --> 07:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
raised i think you need to i think the
 
07:21:39.430 --> 07:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions are better directed to those
 
07:21:41.430 --> 07:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
who are very enmeshed in the in the
 
07:21:43.270 --> 07:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
details of
 
07:21:45.590 --> 07:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
exactly how billing would take place and
 
07:21:47.510 --> 07:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
07:21:47.520 --> 07:21:48.310 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
so

07:21:48.310 --> 07:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:21:50.468 --> 07:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
i'm more trying to just advance the idea
 
07:21:52.708 --> 07:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
of competition and
 
07:21:55.990 --> 07:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
making trying to offer alternatives to
 
07:21:57.430 --> 07:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
residents and
 
07:21:59.910 --> 07:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
also give communities the opportunity to
 
07:22:01.990 --> 07:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
buy green power
 
07:22:03.990 --> 07:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
if they wish
 
07:22:05.830 --> 07:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
can i follow up i don't know who i'm
 
07:22:05.840 --> 07:22:10.830 align:start position:0%
can i follow up i don't know who i'm
asked

07:22:10.830 --> 07:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:14.468 --> 07:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
what mayor the the opportunity to buy
 
07:22:17.590 --> 07:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
green power and to choose a supplier
 
07:22:19.670 --> 07:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
right now is out there
 
07:22:23.750 --> 07:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
and what it doesn't have is enough
 
07:22:26.070 --> 07:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think stability because customers have
 
07:22:27.910 --> 07:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
been burned in the past
 
07:22:27.920 --> 07:22:28.628 align:start position:0%
been burned in the past
so

07:22:28.628 --> 07:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:22:31.670 --> 07:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
do you think perhaps an education
 
07:22:33.910 --> 07:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
program about what's out there would be
 
07:22:36.070 --> 07:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
very important
 
07:22:38.390 --> 07:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
i think i think unity power aggregation
 
07:22:41.190 --> 07:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
would be much more effective i mean uh
 
07:22:41.200 --> 07:22:42.390 align:start position:0%
would be much more effective i mean uh
because

07:22:42.390 --> 07:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:22:44.628 --> 07:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
as has already been
 
07:22:46.548 --> 07:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
testified to
 
07:22:49.350 --> 07:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh the aggregation itself creates the
 
07:22:53.990 --> 07:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining power necessary to uh
 
07:22:56.468 --> 07:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
create many more options in terms of
 
07:22:59.270 --> 07:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
price and mix
 
07:23:00.628 --> 07:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
07:23:03.670 --> 07:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh number one number two i just know as
 
07:23:05.190 --> 07:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
a consumer that when you get these
 
07:23:07.590 --> 07:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
solicitations you're on your own you're
 
07:23:09.590 --> 07:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know you you don't know who this is
 
07:23:12.150 --> 07:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with you know who is this
 
07:23:15.350 --> 07:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
is this a scam you know who knows right
 
07:23:15.360 --> 07:23:16.310 align:start position:0%
is this a scam you know who knows right
so

07:23:16.310 --> 07:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:23:19.750 --> 07:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
um the so i think customers who uh would
 
07:23:19.760 --> 07:23:20.868 align:start position:0%
um the so i think customers who uh would
be

07:23:20.868 --> 07:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:23:24.788 --> 07:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
confident in a an aggregation program
 
07:23:26.708 --> 07:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
a county a city
 
07:23:29.110 --> 07:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
would be more much more comfortable in
 
07:23:31.910 --> 07:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
working with this alternative than
 
07:23:34.230 --> 07:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
people would be trying to deal with the
 
07:23:39.350 --> 07:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:41.350 --> 07:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
07:23:41.360 --> 07:23:42.548 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
um

07:23:42.548 --> 07:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:45.270 --> 07:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
question from representative president
 
07:23:47.670 --> 07:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
07:23:48.830 --> 07:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
mayor for
 
07:23:52.390 --> 07:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned that you support
 
07:23:54.948 --> 07:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
an opt-out and also
 
07:23:57.590 --> 07:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
having access to the customer list
 
07:24:00.150 --> 07:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
would you agree that if it was an opt-in
 
07:24:03.030 --> 07:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
program then as customers sign up for it
 
07:24:05.990 --> 07:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
you would also get the customer list
 
07:24:07.670 --> 07:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
so that would solve both of those
 
07:24:07.680 --> 07:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
so that would solve both of those
problems

07:24:09.110 --> 07:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
problems
 
07:24:10.868 --> 07:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
but the problem that it would create is
 
07:24:13.510 --> 07:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
let's face it i mean the reality is
 
07:24:15.430 --> 07:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
most customers
 
07:24:18.310 --> 07:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
are are not going to really make a
 
07:24:21.270 --> 07:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
opt-in out opt-out decision most will
 
07:24:23.750 --> 07:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
just go with what they're given because
 
07:24:25.110 --> 07:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to understand they're
 
07:24:26.868 --> 07:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
not going to know they're not
 
07:24:29.110 --> 07:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
so they get a letter in the mail they
 
07:24:31.190 --> 07:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't really you know i mean i've gotten
 
07:24:32.708 --> 07:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
these letters i you know what do they
 
07:24:34.310 --> 07:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
mean i you know i
 
07:24:34.320 --> 07:24:35.270 align:start position:0%
mean i you know i
so

07:24:35.270 --> 07:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:24:37.510 --> 07:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
if you have opt in
 
07:24:39.270 --> 07:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
if you have an opt-out system as the
 
07:24:41.670 --> 07:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislature has already adopted then
 
07:24:43.990 --> 07:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
most people will end up in community
 
07:24:46.548 --> 07:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
power just by just because
 
07:24:47.990 --> 07:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're already there
 
07:24:50.390 --> 07:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
and then if they are dissatisfied they
 
07:24:52.150 --> 07:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
can opt out
 
07:24:54.708 --> 07:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
if it's an opt in program then most
 
07:24:57.590 --> 07:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
people will never opt in because
 
07:24:59.030 --> 07:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know you know
 
07:25:01.750 --> 07:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
you it's it's just would be very hard
 
07:25:03.350 --> 07:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know to just
 
07:25:06.070 --> 07:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
people will just go what with the the
 
07:25:08.468 --> 07:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
the path of least resistance which is
 
07:25:11.350 --> 07:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
just to stay with what you have
 
07:25:15.190 --> 07:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
so the whole point of opting out is to
 
07:25:17.670 --> 07:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
introduce people to community power to
 
07:25:19.030 --> 07:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
show them the advent you know to
 
07:25:21.030 --> 07:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
firsthand not try to persuade them but
 
07:25:23.670 --> 07:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate the advantages through
 
07:25:26.468 --> 07:25:26.478 align:start position:0%
lower prices through
 
07:25:28.548 --> 07:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
maybe a different mix of energy
 
07:25:29.670 --> 07:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:25:30.948 --> 07:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh when
 
07:25:33.390 --> 07:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
you know if they find that it is
 
07:25:35.670 --> 07:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory we don't deliver on the
 
07:25:38.070 --> 07:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
promise the price goes up or whatever
 
07:25:39.990 --> 07:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
they can opt out and go back to uh the
 
07:25:40.000 --> 07:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
they can opt out and go back to uh the
utility

07:25:49.030 --> 07:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:49.040 --> 07:25:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
i

07:25:49.910 --> 07:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:25:52.150 --> 07:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
believe i see a representative
 
07:25:53.830 --> 07:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham's hand is up for
 
07:25:56.708 --> 07:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
a question
 
07:25:58.390 --> 07:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much and thank you mr
 
07:26:00.548 --> 07:26:00.558 align:start position:0%
mayor for taking my question you're the
 
07:26:02.628 --> 07:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
first speaker who's spoken about green
 
07:26:05.670 --> 07:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
energy or a different mix of energy
 
07:26:07.910 --> 07:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
when i first encountered community power
 
07:26:10.150 --> 07:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
aggregation that was the advantage that
 
07:26:11.990 --> 07:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
caught my eye that you know we weren't
 
07:26:13.670 --> 07:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with
 
07:26:16.548 --> 07:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
large stodgy utilities who just keep
 
07:26:18.230 --> 07:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
doing things the way they've always done
 
07:26:19.830 --> 07:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
them this is you said was going to be a
 
07:26:23.110 --> 07:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
more nimble organization that could make
 
07:26:25.750 --> 07:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know make choices that were locally
 
07:26:25.760 --> 07:26:28.310 align:start position:0%
you know make choices that were locally
advantageous

07:26:28.310 --> 07:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
advantageous
 
07:26:31.110 --> 07:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
in your dissertation
 
07:26:32.388 --> 07:26:32.398 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
07:26:34.070 --> 07:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
it makes it way harder when you
 
07:26:35.510 --> 07:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
interrupt and i have to listen to your
 
07:26:37.510 --> 07:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
question and figure out what my answer
 
07:26:38.948 --> 07:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
is because now
 
07:26:38.958 --> 07:26:39.910 align:start position:0%
is because now
i

07:26:39.910 --> 07:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:26:41.590 --> 07:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
i was talking about green energy in a
 
07:26:44.388 --> 07:26:44.398 align:start position:0%
different energy mix well i think that i
 
07:26:46.468 --> 07:26:46.478 align:start position:0%
think the point was that you're i'm
 
07:26:48.388 --> 07:26:48.398 align:start position:0%
sorry mr mayor you you you're ahead of
 
07:26:50.150 --> 07:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
me go ahead and answer the question i
 
07:26:52.788 --> 07:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
think i understand the the intent of the
 
07:26:52.798 --> 07:26:53.670 align:start position:0%
think i understand the the intent of the
question

07:26:53.670 --> 07:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:26:56.868 --> 07:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
i mean a community is much more
 
07:26:56.878 --> 07:26:58.788 align:start position:0%
i mean a community is much more
experienced

07:26:58.788 --> 07:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
07:26:58.798 --> 07:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
experienced
in

07:26:59.590 --> 07:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:27:01.830 --> 07:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
reaching out to citizens and getting
 
07:27:03.830 --> 07:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
input i mean we do that all the time
 
07:27:05.830 --> 07:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
like right now the city of nashua is
 
07:27:08.150 --> 07:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
doing a master planning exercise
 
07:27:09.910 --> 07:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're getting the input of people as to
 
07:27:12.070 --> 07:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
what they'd like to see
 
07:27:14.150 --> 07:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
so in addition to developing
 
07:27:16.388 --> 07:27:16.398 align:start position:0%
alternatives i think an advantage of
 
07:27:16.398 --> 07:27:17.830 align:start position:0%
alternatives i think an advantage of
community

07:27:17.830 --> 07:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
07:27:19.750 --> 07:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
power aggregation
 
07:27:20.788 --> 07:27:20.798 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:27:23.030 --> 07:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
we could
 
07:27:23.040 --> 07:27:24.230 align:start position:0%
we could
seek

07:27:24.230 --> 07:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
seek
 
07:27:25.830 --> 07:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
a consensus
 
07:27:27.670 --> 07:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
of customers
 
07:27:31.270 --> 07:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
as to you know what mix of these
 
07:27:33.030 --> 07:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
different alternatives you know these
 
07:27:35.190 --> 07:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
different ideas do you like
 
07:27:37.110 --> 07:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
do you would you rather us to go just as
 
07:27:39.590 --> 07:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
cheap as we can would you rather us to
 
07:27:43.190 --> 07:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
introduce green power or maybe a mix
 
07:27:45.990 --> 07:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
um it would also potentially be possible
 
07:27:47.750 --> 07:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
to maybe offer
 
07:27:47.760 --> 07:27:48.788 align:start position:0%
to maybe offer
several

07:27:48.788 --> 07:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
several
 
07:27:48.798 --> 07:27:54.548 align:start position:0%
several
um

07:27:54.548 --> 07:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:56.948 --> 07:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
oh dear
 
07:27:59.190 --> 07:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
07:28:01.510 --> 07:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
some bargaining power
 
07:28:04.468 --> 07:28:04.478 align:start position:0%
here's a portfolio with the less green
 
07:28:06.708 --> 07:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
energy that costs less but here's the
 
07:28:08.150 --> 07:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
one that caught you know more green
 
07:28:10.868 --> 07:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
energy costs maybe a little more
 
07:28:12.628 --> 07:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
and people could select i mean we could
 
07:28:14.468 --> 07:28:14.478 align:start position:0%
work with our residents to come up with
 
07:28:17.510 --> 07:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
these alternatives that
 
07:28:21.270 --> 07:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
and give them the kind of uh input and
 
07:28:23.750 --> 07:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
involvement which really is not
 
07:28:26.150 --> 07:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
realistic when you're dealing with
 
07:28:27.510 --> 07:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
a you know
 
07:28:30.708 --> 07:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
a national publicly traded utility
 
07:28:32.868 --> 07:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
07:28:34.628 --> 07:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
07:28:37.190 --> 07:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
i see a hand raised by uh representative
 
07:28:39.830 --> 07:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
samson police for a question
 
07:28:42.868 --> 07:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh nice to
 
07:28:45.030 --> 07:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
hear from you jim this is peter samsich
 
07:28:46.310 --> 07:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
hi peter
 
07:28:48.468 --> 07:28:48.478 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
07:28:50.548 --> 07:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
number one i it was mentioned before
 
07:28:50.558 --> 07:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
number one i it was mentioned before
that

07:28:51.350 --> 07:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:28:53.990 --> 07:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh there was not a really big demand by
 
07:28:56.150 --> 07:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in this state for
 
07:28:59.110 --> 07:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
community power and aggregation you
 
07:29:01.750 --> 07:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
listed a whole bunch of towns and cities
 
07:29:04.388 --> 07:29:04.398 align:start position:0%
that you you thought were involved in
 
07:29:06.948 --> 07:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
serious interest in this uh how would
 
07:29:10.150 --> 07:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
you assess how big the demand is right
 
07:29:12.388 --> 07:29:12.398 align:start position:0%
now that you know of
 
07:29:14.708 --> 07:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
well so we've been working uh
 
07:29:17.670 --> 07:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
closely with kesher county rockingham
 
07:29:17.680 --> 07:29:18.628 align:start position:0%
closely with kesher county rockingham
county

07:29:18.628 --> 07:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
county
 
07:29:18.638 --> 07:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
county
hanover

07:29:19.910 --> 07:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
hanover
 
07:29:22.150 --> 07:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
and mr bilo could give you the more
 
07:29:25.990 --> 07:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
details but hanover lebanon
 
07:29:28.628 --> 07:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
and i think other communities
 
07:29:31.110 --> 07:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh formally
 
07:29:32.628 --> 07:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
seeking to
 
07:29:35.110 --> 07:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
actually formalize an agreement between
 
07:29:37.510 --> 07:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
between us as to how to
 
07:29:39.110 --> 07:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
service customers if this thing ever
 
07:29:42.310 --> 07:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
gets off the ground things like that
 
07:29:42.320 --> 07:29:43.670 align:start position:0%
gets off the ground things like that
the

07:29:43.670 --> 07:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:29:45.670 --> 07:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i've been talking with other
 
07:29:47.590 --> 07:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
communities that are certainly
 
07:29:49.830 --> 07:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
interested as they begin to learn about
 
07:29:51.910 --> 07:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
it for example
 
07:29:54.070 --> 07:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation this is just one
 
07:29:56.070 --> 07:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
example but with the
 
07:29:57.990 --> 07:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh mayor of dover and we've i've
 
07:29:59.750 --> 07:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
discussed this we've discussed this on a
 
07:30:02.230 --> 07:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
call with mayors from about 10 cities
 
07:30:04.230 --> 07:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
all at the same time but in the
 
07:30:04.240 --> 07:30:05.270 align:start position:0%
all at the same time but in the
follow-up

07:30:05.270 --> 07:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
07:30:06.788 --> 07:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
i talked with the mayor of dober whose
 
07:30:09.350 --> 07:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
name bob carrier and he says you know
 
07:30:11.350 --> 07:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
that sounds pretty good i would like you
 
07:30:13.670 --> 07:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
to we have an energy advisory committee
 
07:30:15.350 --> 07:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
here in dover and you know this is
 
07:30:18.070 --> 07:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
pretty technical could you get together
 
07:30:20.548 --> 07:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
with you know virtually of course with
 
07:30:22.708 --> 07:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
our energy committee and
 
07:30:24.948 --> 07:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
brief them on this so that they can they
 
07:30:27.430 --> 07:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
can give me their their thoughts on
 
07:30:29.830 --> 07:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether this makes sense for dover
 
07:30:29.840 --> 07:30:30.788 align:start position:0%
whether this makes sense for dover
and

07:30:30.788 --> 07:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:30:33.190 --> 07:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh we're we've got that kind of in the
 
07:30:36.468 --> 07:30:36.478 align:start position:0%
works um and we've had other similar
 
07:30:38.788 --> 07:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
discussions with other communities who i
 
07:30:42.070 --> 07:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
think as they learn more about it uh
 
07:30:44.628 --> 07:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
become more and more interested
 
07:30:46.708 --> 07:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh follow up mr chair
 
07:30:48.708 --> 07:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
yes from last follow
 
07:30:52.468 --> 07:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
uh and uh jim uh the uh as i understood
 
07:30:54.788 --> 07:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
it for a standard from what nashua is
 
07:30:57.030 --> 07:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
involved with right now with their hydro
 
07:30:58.628 --> 07:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
dams and so forth
 
07:31:01.190 --> 07:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
how would your capability of providing
 
07:31:02.468 --> 07:31:02.478 align:start position:0%
your local
 
07:31:04.948 --> 07:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh city uh power
 
07:31:06.868 --> 07:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
as part of this program how does that
 
07:31:09.270 --> 07:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
integrate into this community power
 
07:31:11.750 --> 07:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
equation was taken home
 
07:31:15.030 --> 07:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
i think we would need to get um i i
 
07:31:16.548 --> 07:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
think we need to get someone with more
 
07:31:18.310 --> 07:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
technical knowledge than me to answer
 
07:31:20.708 --> 07:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
that question okay but that does remind
 
07:31:22.548 --> 07:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
me of another issue which is that under
 
07:31:22.558 --> 07:31:24.230 align:start position:0%
me of another issue which is that under
315

07:31:24.230 --> 07:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
315
 
07:31:26.948 --> 07:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
the default utility would retain all
 
07:31:28.708 --> 07:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
solar customers meaning people
 
07:31:30.548 --> 07:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
residential uh
 
07:31:33.830 --> 07:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
solar uh users soda
 
07:31:35.910 --> 07:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
solar panels on their roof even those
 
07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
that went solar after the convert after
 
07:31:39.670 --> 07:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
the switchover
 
07:31:41.510 --> 07:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't seem like it makes
 
07:31:42.948 --> 07:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
sense either so that's another issue
 
07:31:44.788 --> 07:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
with 315.
 
07:31:47.110 --> 07:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:31:48.948 --> 07:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
we've spent a long time and we have a
 
07:31:51.030 --> 07:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
lot more people to speak on the interest
 
07:31:53.830 --> 07:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
of moving on i'm going to thank uh mary
 
07:31:55.830 --> 07:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
dodges for his testimony and the
 
07:31:58.788 --> 07:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
questions and i will call on a member of
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
the public a uh an amy farhan if she's
 
07:32:04.150 --> 07:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
07:32:07.350 --> 07:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
a member of the public yeah iran
 
07:32:09.670 --> 07:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thanks for taking my
 
07:32:12.310 --> 07:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
call thank you um to all of you
 
07:32:14.628 --> 07:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
especially who are staying home and
 
07:32:16.708 --> 07:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
staying safe
 
07:32:19.030 --> 07:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
i am one of those people that has solar
 
07:32:20.948 --> 07:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
on my home um you were just talking to
 
07:32:22.788 --> 07:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
the mayor about
 
07:32:22.798 --> 07:32:24.310 align:start position:0%
the mayor about
and

07:32:24.310 --> 07:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:32:28.548 --> 07:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
i um my my family wants to be a part of
 
07:32:30.468 --> 07:32:30.478 align:start position:0%
this community power
 
07:32:34.070 --> 07:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
but under hb 315
 
07:32:37.270 --> 07:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
we would not have the ability to do that
 
07:32:37.280 --> 07:32:38.628 align:start position:0%
we would not have the ability to do that
so

07:32:38.628 --> 07:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:32:40.868 --> 07:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
315 eliminates
 
07:32:44.230 --> 07:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know the ability for my solar power
 
07:32:46.948 --> 07:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
to participate in the community power
 
07:32:46.958 --> 07:32:48.230 align:start position:0%
to participate in the community power
aggregation

07:32:48.230 --> 07:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
07:32:51.670 --> 07:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue for me personally um
 
07:32:54.230 --> 07:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know i was able to afford a solar
 
07:32:54.240 --> 07:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
you know i was able to afford a solar
array

07:32:55.190 --> 07:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
array
 
07:32:57.350 --> 07:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
not a lot of people can
 
07:32:59.190 --> 07:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that's been an issue
 
07:33:00.628 --> 07:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
07:33:03.750 --> 07:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone
 
07:33:06.548 --> 07:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
and another problem with hp 315 is that
 
07:33:08.150 --> 07:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
it prevents
 
07:33:10.628 --> 07:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
low to moderate income folks from
 
07:33:10.638 --> 07:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
low to moderate income folks from
receiving

07:33:11.750 --> 07:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
07:33:13.990 --> 07:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit of solar power
 
07:33:15.910 --> 07:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
and from participating in community
 
07:33:17.190 --> 07:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
power so
 
07:33:19.670 --> 07:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know the governor's letter is saying
 
07:33:21.350 --> 07:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
sure that he's
 
07:33:23.830 --> 07:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
he's very interested in helping low to
 
07:33:26.548 --> 07:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
moderate income families but
 
07:33:28.310 --> 07:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
the truth is
 
07:33:32.150 --> 07:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
315 is is not going to allow them to
 
07:33:32.160 --> 07:33:33.270 align:start position:0%
315 is is not going to allow them to
to

07:33:33.270 --> 07:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:33:35.590 --> 07:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
be part of this so
 
07:33:37.430 --> 07:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
07:33:40.230 --> 07:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
i i'll also work on an energy committee
 
07:33:43.190 --> 07:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
in exeter um we've worked with
 
07:33:45.670 --> 07:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
mr bilo and mr herndon
 
07:33:48.070 --> 07:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
and our energy committee has been very
 
07:33:51.510 --> 07:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
excited about this project and
 
07:33:53.830 --> 07:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
we've formed committees we've we've
 
07:33:57.590 --> 07:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
worked we've spent a lot of hours on it
 
07:34:00.788 --> 07:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
and so i guess just from
 
07:34:02.230 --> 07:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
their point of view from our point of
 
07:34:04.150 --> 07:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
view it's disappointing because it feels
 
07:34:04.160 --> 07:34:05.190 align:start position:0%
view it's disappointing because it feels
like

07:34:05.190 --> 07:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:34:08.788 --> 07:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
hb 315 is just basically crushing that
 
07:34:09.910 --> 07:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
for us
 
07:34:09.920 --> 07:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
for us
um

07:34:11.270 --> 07:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:13.350 --> 07:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
and that's going on with a lot of town
 
07:34:13.360 --> 07:34:14.070 align:start position:0%
and that's going on with a lot of town
so

07:34:14.070 --> 07:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:34:16.708 --> 07:34:16.718 align:start position:0%
i hope we're seeing this for what it is
 
07:34:19.590 --> 07:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know the idea that um
 
07:34:22.628 --> 07:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
that eversource was coming in to sort of
 
07:34:24.868 --> 07:34:24.878 align:start position:0%
clean up the language here
 
07:34:24.878 --> 07:34:25.590 align:start position:0%
clean up the language here
i

07:34:25.590 --> 07:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:34:26.910 --> 07:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's a
 
07:34:29.110 --> 07:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization i think
 
07:34:31.590 --> 07:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
they recognized a sort of lull in
 
07:34:32.948 --> 07:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
progress and
 
07:34:35.030 --> 07:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
and jumped in and said here's what we
 
07:34:36.628 --> 07:34:36.638 align:start position:0%
want instead
 
07:34:38.628 --> 07:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
so i hope
 
07:34:43.030 --> 07:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
i hope everyone today can can see that
 
07:34:44.150 --> 07:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:34:44.160 --> 07:34:44.948 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

07:34:44.948 --> 07:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:48.948 --> 07:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony i
 
07:34:50.310 --> 07:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
07:34:52.788 --> 07:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
hands raised anywhere in the room or
 
07:34:55.030 --> 07:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
on the screen so thank you very much for
 
07:34:57.750 --> 07:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
testimony we appreciate it moving on to
 
07:34:59.110 --> 07:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
the next
 
07:35:01.590 --> 07:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
speaker we are going to recognize mr
 
07:35:05.030 --> 07:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
donaghy from eversource
 
07:35:06.788 --> 07:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
donna iran
 
07:35:09.350 --> 07:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much good afternoon um i
 
07:35:10.788 --> 07:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
am donna gamache director of
 
07:35:13.190 --> 07:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
governmental affairs for eversource and
 
07:35:15.910 --> 07:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
i have matthew fossum uh with me today
 
07:35:18.310 --> 07:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
who's intimately engaged at the puc on
 
07:35:20.150 --> 07:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
this issue and is available to answer
 
07:35:22.150 --> 07:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
your questions after
 
07:35:24.948 --> 07:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
we support house bill 315 especially
 
07:35:26.230 --> 07:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that's been talked
 
07:35:28.388 --> 07:35:28.398 align:start position:0%
about it's important to note that we
 
07:35:30.070 --> 07:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
have worked with many communities in
 
07:35:31.990 --> 07:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
other states to successfully implement
 
07:35:33.750 --> 07:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
community aggregation over the past
 
07:35:35.830 --> 07:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
several years for example in
 
07:35:38.150 --> 07:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts eversource has worked with
 
07:35:40.628 --> 07:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 different communities
 
07:35:42.868 --> 07:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
to get aggregation programs on the
 
07:35:46.310 --> 07:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
ground of the 70 10 have just completed
 
07:35:49.270 --> 07:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
the regulatory review of the programs by
 
07:35:51.430 --> 07:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts version of the public
 
07:35:53.590 --> 07:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
utilities commission and they should be
 
07:35:55.590 --> 07:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
on the ground very soon
 
07:35:57.350 --> 07:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
as you have already heard there's a
 
07:35:59.110 --> 07:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
difference between community aggregation
 
07:36:01.190 --> 07:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
and community power although they can be
 
07:36:04.948 --> 07:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
combined house bill 315 ends the hold up
 
07:36:06.788 --> 07:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
of rolling out community aggregation
 
07:36:09.350 --> 07:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
upon passage we support the bill and the
 
07:36:10.788 --> 07:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
amendment because not only does it
 
07:36:12.868 --> 07:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
finally unlock aggregation but it
 
07:36:15.190 --> 07:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
actually ensures that
 
07:36:17.030 --> 07:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
some of the risks to aggregators that
 
07:36:19.670 --> 07:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
exist today are removed and it makes
 
07:36:21.350 --> 07:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
sure that they recognize that new
 
07:36:23.830 --> 07:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire is serious on this issue
 
07:36:25.910 --> 07:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
unlike the open discussion that's taking
 
07:36:28.548 --> 07:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
place right now about this bill and what
 
07:36:31.030 --> 07:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
this bill might or might not do
 
07:36:33.270 --> 07:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
and the upcoming amendment unfortunately
 
07:36:35.190 --> 07:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
in 2019 there were a number of last
 
07:36:36.868 --> 07:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
minute amendments added to a bill where
 
07:36:39.350 --> 07:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
the language was vague and confusing
 
07:36:41.430 --> 07:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
and there was no public input there was
 
07:36:43.750 --> 07:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
no review there was no public hearing
 
07:36:45.910 --> 07:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
there are always unintended consequences
 
07:36:48.230 --> 07:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
when such complex and sweeping language
 
07:36:50.150 --> 07:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
does not have stakeholder input or
 
07:36:53.030 --> 07:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
review so as a result the lack of
 
07:36:54.868 --> 07:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
understanding and disagreement from a
 
07:36:56.628 --> 07:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
variety of interests over what the
 
07:36:58.788 --> 07:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
existing law means has resulted in rules
 
07:37:00.708 --> 07:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
being stalled at the public utilities
 
07:37:03.110 --> 07:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission a year and a half after the
 
07:37:05.670 --> 07:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
bill passed no progress has been made
 
07:37:07.510 --> 07:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing a number of bills that
 
07:37:09.030 --> 07:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
have already been introduced this
 
07:37:10.628 --> 07:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
session by other legislators and
 
07:37:12.948 --> 07:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
supported by different energy interests
 
07:37:15.430 --> 07:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
aimed at trying to clarify the law so it
 
07:37:18.868 --> 07:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
is clear that a fix is necessary let's
 
07:37:21.030 --> 07:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
get down to the current problems during
 
07:37:23.350 --> 07:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
rule making discussions at the puc
 
07:37:24.788 --> 07:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
several issues have come to light
 
07:37:26.708 --> 07:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
specific to community power plans
 
07:37:26.718 --> 07:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
specific to community power plans
including

07:37:27.910 --> 07:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
including
 
07:37:29.830 --> 07:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
um problems with infrastructure and
 
07:37:31.910 --> 07:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
system changes that the utilities would
 
07:37:33.750 --> 07:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
need to implement
 
07:37:34.948 --> 07:37:34.958 align:start position:0%
you know in order to implement some of
 
07:37:36.948 --> 07:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
these billing requirements it includes
 
07:37:39.670 --> 07:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
potentially converting our meters to ami
 
07:37:42.788 --> 07:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
meters or what we call smart meters that
 
07:37:45.750 --> 07:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
shares two-way information
 
07:37:47.190 --> 07:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
and also
 
07:37:49.670 --> 07:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
also changes to our customer information
 
07:37:49.680 --> 07:37:50.388 align:start position:0%
also changes to our customer information
system

07:37:50.388 --> 07:37:50.398 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:37:51.750 --> 07:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
so between in
 
07:37:53.270 --> 07:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
changes to our customer information
 
07:37:55.750 --> 07:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
system and in the potential for
 
07:37:57.510 --> 07:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
widespread or we don't really know how
 
07:38:00.628 --> 07:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
much uh new smart meters
 
07:38:02.310 --> 07:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
we don't actually know what the cost
 
07:38:03.670 --> 07:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be for it because we haven't been
 
07:38:06.310 --> 07:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
told what the scope is yet but we are on
 
07:38:08.708 --> 07:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
record in a specific puc docket about
 
07:38:11.030 --> 07:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
the cost to convert to those meters and
 
07:38:14.708 --> 07:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
that is it on record in excess of 200
 
07:38:16.230 --> 07:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
07:38:18.548 --> 07:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
given limited time to testify today we
 
07:38:19.830 --> 07:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
want you to recognize that there are
 
07:38:21.350 --> 07:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
many many other issues that are
 
07:38:24.230 --> 07:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
potentially costly and complex i will
 
07:38:25.990 --> 07:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony that goes into
 
07:38:27.990 --> 07:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
further detail on all of those issues
 
07:38:30.230 --> 07:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
but there is one particular issue that
 
07:38:32.468 --> 07:38:32.478 align:start position:0%
is concerning that i want to raise today
 
07:38:34.628 --> 07:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
the lack of clarity in existing law
 
07:38:37.110 --> 07:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
about what is and is not included has
 
07:38:39.030 --> 07:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
led to claims that communities who
 
07:38:41.670 --> 07:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
undertake community power plans should
 
07:38:44.230 --> 07:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
or must have a view of our distribution
 
07:38:46.948 --> 07:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
grid to support plans that they may
 
07:38:50.230 --> 07:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
potentially develop in the future
 
07:38:52.868 --> 07:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
theoretical now because the law is
 
07:38:54.948 --> 07:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
unclear there is an interpretation of
 
07:38:56.948 --> 07:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
that language that would require a
 
07:38:59.430 --> 07:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
prototype for a brand new platform
 
07:39:01.830 --> 07:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
allowing a town employee employees or
 
07:39:04.468 --> 07:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
some contractor perhaps to have a view
 
07:39:07.030 --> 07:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
into this grid into the distribution
 
07:39:07.040 --> 07:39:07.990 align:start position:0%
into this grid into the distribution
grid

07:39:07.990 --> 07:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
grid
 
07:39:10.230 --> 07:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
let me be clear there is nothing on the
 
07:39:11.830 --> 07:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
shelf that would enable this and
 
07:39:14.150 --> 07:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
therefore no idea on the overall cost
 
07:39:16.628 --> 07:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
and who would pay for this set the cost
 
07:39:18.548 --> 07:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
aside how would these communities ensure
 
07:39:21.110 --> 07:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
security of the grid every single week
 
07:39:23.590 --> 07:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
we receive more than one million hits on
 
07:39:25.910 --> 07:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
our system mainly by bad characters in
 
07:39:28.150 --> 07:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
other countries to shut down our system
 
07:39:30.868 --> 07:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
we have a highly sophisticated security
 
07:39:32.868 --> 07:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
system and as you can imagine we're
 
07:39:35.830 --> 07:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
heavily regulated to make sure that we
 
07:39:38.468 --> 07:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
are always more than adequately securing
 
07:39:41.030 --> 07:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
the system these issues are outside of
 
07:39:43.430 --> 07:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
typical aggregation policies in place in
 
07:39:45.830 --> 07:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
most states and make this law extremely
 
07:39:48.548 --> 07:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
complicated and expensive to implement
 
07:39:49.510 --> 07:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
so in
 
07:39:51.190 --> 07:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
closing i just wanted to reiterate that
 
07:39:53.270 --> 07:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
we support implementing a law that
 
07:39:55.190 --> 07:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
allows a community aggregation to move
 
07:39:58.150 --> 07:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
forward but we also support still
 
07:40:00.070 --> 07:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
studying all those other issues all the
 
07:40:02.388 --> 07:40:02.398 align:start position:0%
concerns that we just raised so that we
 
07:40:04.310 --> 07:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
can find a way to move forward if it
 
07:40:06.788 --> 07:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
makes sense if if our customers want it
 
07:40:09.030 --> 07:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
and if we everybody can afford it
 
07:40:11.510 --> 07:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
they're very complex and we want to make
 
07:40:13.350 --> 07:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
sure that if there are going to be major
 
07:40:15.750 --> 07:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
investments and major ratepayer
 
07:40:18.310 --> 07:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
contributions that it gets the it gets
 
07:40:19.910 --> 07:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
the light of day and it gets fully
 
07:40:23.910 --> 07:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
studied so we believe house bill 13 315
 
07:40:26.310 --> 07:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
allows all of that to happen and so with
 
07:40:28.150 --> 07:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
that i just wanted to make sure that you
 
07:40:29.670 --> 07:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
knew that matthew was here and matthew
 
07:40:31.430 --> 07:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
can respond to your questions because of
 
07:40:34.388 --> 07:40:34.398 align:start position:0%
his um in-depth involvement at the buc
 
07:40:35.590 --> 07:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:40:36.948 --> 07:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you from squash thank you for your
 
07:40:39.670 --> 07:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
testimony uh questions
 
07:40:41.670 --> 07:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
i see uh
 
07:40:43.830 --> 07:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative samsung's hand
 
07:40:45.830 --> 07:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
up for a question
 
07:40:47.750 --> 07:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
07:40:49.750 --> 07:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you donna for taking my
 
07:40:49.760 --> 07:40:50.948 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you donna for taking my
question

07:40:50.948 --> 07:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:40:54.548 --> 07:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
um i'm not surprised that eversource is
 
07:40:57.030 --> 07:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
really enjoying this bill because they
 
07:40:58.230 --> 07:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
wrote the bill
 
07:40:58.240 --> 07:40:58.948 align:start position:0%
wrote the bill
so

07:40:58.948 --> 07:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:41:00.628 --> 07:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
that's not a surprise to me but i want
 
07:41:03.430 --> 07:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
to say to begin with that uh
 
07:41:06.708 --> 07:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
i congratulate every source for
 
07:41:08.468 --> 07:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
all the accolades they've been getting
 
07:41:10.070 --> 07:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
as one of the best
 
07:41:12.948 --> 07:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
utilities in the country for energy
 
07:41:15.190 --> 07:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
efficiency and even renewable energy
 
07:41:17.750 --> 07:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
efforts unfortunately those efforts have
 
07:41:19.910 --> 07:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
not happened in new hampshire and that
 
07:41:22.708 --> 07:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
is a problem and this bill is maybe
 
07:41:24.548 --> 07:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
reflective of what's happening to them
 
07:41:26.230 --> 07:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire representative
 
07:41:26.240 --> 07:41:27.670 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire representative
thompson

07:41:27.670 --> 07:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
thompson
 
07:41:30.150 --> 07:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
my question is don't you agree with me
 
07:41:32.150 --> 07:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be better for eversource
 
07:41:34.310 --> 07:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
to be leading the charge for community
 
07:41:36.948 --> 07:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
power than opposing it
 
07:41:39.030 --> 07:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
well i am going to let uh matthew speak
 
07:41:41.670 --> 07:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
to that but i want to say that we would
 
07:41:44.310 --> 07:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
be happy to lead the charge on any clean
 
07:41:47.430 --> 07:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
energy programs community power programs
 
07:41:49.190 --> 07:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
as long as we know what the costs are
 
07:41:50.708 --> 07:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
going to be that they're going to be
 
07:41:52.708 --> 07:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
secure and who's going to pay the bill
 
07:41:55.830 --> 07:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
but i can pass that off to um matthew if
 
07:42:00.388 --> 07:42:00.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:02.150 --> 07:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh brazilian for
 
07:42:03.910 --> 07:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions please uh thank you mr
 
07:42:05.910 --> 07:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you donna gamache for
 
07:42:07.590 --> 07:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
07:42:09.990 --> 07:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh is it true that uh municipal solar
 
07:42:11.270 --> 07:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
power would not be allowed to be
 
07:42:14.830 --> 07:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
generated and sold to aggregated
 
07:42:17.430 --> 07:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
customers that i absolutely have to pass
 
07:42:19.190 --> 07:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
off to matthew can you take that matthew
 
07:42:19.200 --> 07:42:25.110 align:start position:0%
off to matthew can you take that matthew
please

07:42:25.110 --> 07:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:27.990 --> 07:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:30.628 --> 07:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
well if matthew can't for some reason
 
07:42:33.190 --> 07:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
respond here's what i'm going to say i i
 
07:42:35.510 --> 07:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
have not heard that i i've not heard
 
07:42:37.830 --> 07:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere that anybody if you if if a
 
07:42:40.310 --> 07:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
local community there's net metering um
 
07:42:42.230 --> 07:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
if a local community wants to have their
 
07:42:43.670 --> 07:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
own power they want to build their own
 
07:42:45.670 --> 07:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
solar they can do all of that today they
 
07:42:47.750 --> 07:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
do not need house bill 315 they don't
 
07:42:49.830 --> 07:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
need to kill house bill 315 to make that
 
07:42:51.990 --> 07:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
happen so um i don't know where that
 
07:42:53.750 --> 07:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
comes from but i do wish that we could
 
07:42:55.110 --> 07:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
get matthew to give a little more
 
07:42:56.388 --> 07:42:56.398 align:start position:0%
clarity to that
 
07:42:58.948 --> 07:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
i see that matthew has come on so uh
 
07:43:02.548 --> 07:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:04.628 --> 07:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me now
 
07:43:04.638 --> 07:43:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me now
yes

07:43:05.430 --> 07:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:43:07.590 --> 07:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh i'll just
 
07:43:10.788 --> 07:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh for tuesday my name is matthew fossum
 
07:43:14.708 --> 07:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
i'm an attorney with eversource focusing
 
07:43:16.788 --> 07:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
primarily almost exclusively on on new
 
07:43:20.388 --> 07:43:20.398 align:start position:0%
hampshire regulatory issues
 
07:43:22.868 --> 07:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
in response to uh the question as i
 
07:43:24.788 --> 07:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
understand it which has to do with
 
07:43:24.798 --> 07:43:26.548 align:start position:0%
understand it which has to do with
whether

07:43:26.548 --> 07:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
whether
 
07:43:29.830 --> 07:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
solar could be included in a community
 
07:43:29.840 --> 07:43:31.430 align:start position:0%
solar could be included in a community
aggregation

07:43:31.430 --> 07:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
07:43:35.110 --> 07:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
if 315 was to pass
 
07:43:37.910 --> 07:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that it can and i it's not
 
07:43:41.670 --> 07:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
clear to me what provision or provisions
 
07:43:43.510 --> 07:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
would seem to indicate
 
07:43:43.520 --> 07:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
would seem to indicate
otherwise

07:43:45.990 --> 07:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
07:43:48.468 --> 07:43:48.478 align:start position:0%
i can only speculate that perhaps
 
07:43:51.030 --> 07:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's a view toward
 
07:43:53.510 --> 07:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of the proposed amendments that's in
 
07:43:53.520 --> 07:43:54.948 align:start position:0%
one of the proposed amendments that's in
315

07:43:54.948 --> 07:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
315
 
07:43:57.590 --> 07:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
um that strikes out a reference to the
 
07:43:57.600 --> 07:43:58.788 align:start position:0%
um that strikes out a reference to the
plan

07:43:58.788 --> 07:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
plan
 
07:44:01.270 --> 07:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh to an aggregation plan covering uh
 
07:44:02.868 --> 07:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
07:44:05.910 --> 07:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
but that's not to eliminate net metering
 
07:44:08.468 --> 07:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
or solar generation
 
07:44:10.070 --> 07:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
those would stay
 
07:44:12.548 --> 07:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
the intent as i understand it there is
 
07:44:14.230 --> 07:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
basically to leave those things more or
 
07:44:16.548 --> 07:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
less as they are today
 
07:44:17.590 --> 07:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
not to
 
07:44:20.388 --> 07:44:20.398 align:start position:0%
eliminate them or
 
07:44:27.350 --> 07:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:28.868 --> 07:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
07:44:31.910 --> 07:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative camola has a
 
07:44:35.110 --> 07:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:35.120 --> 07:44:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

07:44:37.830 --> 07:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:44:39.830 --> 07:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
07:44:41.270 --> 07:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:44:43.590 --> 07:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you i just had a quick
 
07:44:45.590 --> 07:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
question can things like net metering
 
07:44:47.830 --> 07:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
and energy efficiency programs be done
 
07:44:51.190 --> 07:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
separately from aggregation
 
07:44:54.388 --> 07:44:54.398 align:start position:0%
yes they can uh in fact i mean there is
 
07:44:57.110 --> 07:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
there is a statute um that exists and
 
07:44:58.868 --> 07:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
has existed
 
07:45:02.708 --> 07:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
for a number of years now in rsa 37
 
07:45:05.510 --> 07:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry rsa53f
 
07:45:07.190 --> 07:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
that allows for the establishment of
 
07:45:08.788 --> 07:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency in clean energy
 
07:45:12.388 --> 07:45:12.398 align:start position:0%
districts um obviously 315 doesn't touch
 
07:45:12.398 --> 07:45:13.190 align:start position:0%
districts um obviously 315 doesn't touch
that

07:45:13.190 --> 07:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:45:15.350 --> 07:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
that statute at all and it allows
 
07:45:17.430 --> 07:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
certain activities to occur
 
07:45:19.510 --> 07:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh there so that that could be done
 
07:45:21.590 --> 07:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
before can be done after
 
07:45:23.910 --> 07:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
um and so there we don't
 
07:45:26.468 --> 07:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
see anything about 315 that would impede
 
07:45:28.150 --> 07:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh the creation of districts that would
 
07:45:30.310 --> 07:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
do that sort of thing
 
07:45:33.190 --> 07:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
07:45:36.310 --> 07:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
mcgee you have your hand up
 
07:45:37.910 --> 07:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
i do thank you
 
07:45:40.150 --> 07:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you mr fossum for taking my
 
07:45:42.628 --> 07:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
question or miss gamache whoever um
 
07:45:44.150 --> 07:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
prefers to answer it
 
07:45:47.590 --> 07:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about um whether eversource
 
07:45:51.030 --> 07:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
has uh ami or smart meters in other
 
07:45:52.548 --> 07:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
states that they're serving in other
 
07:45:54.948 --> 07:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire
 
07:45:57.190 --> 07:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh we do not
 
07:45:59.030 --> 07:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
so you don't have you don't have smart
 
07:46:02.388 --> 07:46:02.398 align:start position:0%
meters anywhere that you provide service
 
07:46:04.310 --> 07:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
so our service territory in the broader
 
07:46:06.708 --> 07:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
company covers connecticut massachusetts
 
07:46:08.388 --> 07:46:08.398 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire and in all of those
 
07:46:10.230 --> 07:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
states we employ an
 
07:46:12.388 --> 07:46:12.398 align:start position:0%
amr an advance
 
07:46:15.030 --> 07:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
automated meter reading system
 
07:46:15.040 --> 07:46:15.910 align:start position:0%
automated meter reading system
um

07:46:15.910 --> 07:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:46:17.270 --> 07:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the metering that we
 
07:46:19.030 --> 07:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
have in place across our entire service
 
07:46:19.040 --> 07:46:20.788 align:start position:0%
have in place across our entire service
territory

07:46:20.788 --> 07:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
territory
 
07:46:23.030 --> 07:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
and can you explain to us how
 
07:46:25.110 --> 07:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's different in terms of smart like
 
07:46:29.590 --> 07:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:31.510 --> 07:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
certainly and and you know i'll i'll
 
07:46:32.948 --> 07:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
note in this that at least in new
 
07:46:34.230 --> 07:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire i know there's an additional
 
07:46:36.708 --> 07:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
difficulty that um that requires an
 
07:46:39.990 --> 07:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
opt-in uh for for smart meters but
 
07:46:44.070 --> 07:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
that issue aside um the difference is is
 
07:46:44.080 --> 07:46:44.868 align:start position:0%
that issue aside um the difference is is
not

07:46:44.868 --> 07:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:46:47.990 --> 07:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
so a an amr system functions much the
 
07:46:50.948 --> 07:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
same way as the older systems do they
 
07:46:53.190 --> 07:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
generally speaking they take a
 
07:46:54.788 --> 07:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
a single reading
 
07:46:56.310 --> 07:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
actually take multiple readings but that
 
07:46:59.110 --> 07:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
reading is is collected one time per
 
07:46:59.120 --> 07:47:00.388 align:start position:0%
reading is is collected one time per
month

07:47:00.388 --> 07:47:00.398 align:start position:0%
month
 
07:47:03.990 --> 07:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
um and then that is the value that is
 
07:47:07.270 --> 07:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
used for uh determining the bill
 
07:47:10.468 --> 07:47:10.478 align:start position:0%
uh that's rendered to the customer
 
07:47:12.708 --> 07:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
so on our current system that's done by
 
07:47:14.468 --> 07:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
a drive-by system
 
07:47:16.150 --> 07:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
the the meters
 
07:47:16.160 --> 07:47:16.948 align:start position:0%
the the meters
a

07:47:16.948 --> 07:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:47:19.270 --> 07:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle drives by and remotely collects
 
07:47:20.948 --> 07:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
that information
 
07:47:22.548 --> 07:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
and then that's brought back into our
 
07:47:24.868 --> 07:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
secure meter data management system and
 
07:47:26.468 --> 07:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
used for billing
 
07:47:29.350 --> 07:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
an ami system
 
07:47:31.350 --> 07:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
sort of at the basic level eliminates
 
07:47:34.388 --> 07:47:34.398 align:start position:0%
that drive by and has that meter data
 
07:47:35.990 --> 07:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
sent by
 
07:47:38.468 --> 07:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
wireline or wireless technology
 
07:47:40.150 --> 07:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
back to the utility
 
07:47:41.510 --> 07:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh so that's
 
07:47:42.628 --> 07:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
sort of the
 
07:47:45.350 --> 07:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
the one big difference operationally
 
07:47:48.548 --> 07:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
beyond that uh
 
07:47:51.270 --> 07:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of ami system that
 
07:47:53.270 --> 07:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
is installed then you can have meters
 
07:47:54.388 --> 07:47:54.398 align:start position:0%
that can do
 
07:47:55.910 --> 07:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
more than
 
07:47:59.430 --> 07:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
a once a month reading they can
 
07:48:01.590 --> 07:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
send out as mr beelow referred to as
 
07:48:04.468 --> 07:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
interval meters they can read and report
 
07:48:04.478 --> 07:48:06.070 align:start position:0%
interval meters they can read and report
information

07:48:06.070 --> 07:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
information
 
07:48:09.350 --> 07:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
much more frequently than once a month
 
07:48:12.310 --> 07:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps as far down as within 15 minute
 
07:48:12.320 --> 07:48:14.388 align:start position:0%
perhaps as far down as within 15 minute
intervals

07:48:14.388 --> 07:48:14.398 align:start position:0%
intervals
 
07:48:16.388 --> 07:48:16.398 align:start position:0%
they would allow the
 
07:48:19.270 --> 07:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
utility company to
 
07:48:21.430 --> 07:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
send a signal to that meter to test it
 
07:48:22.948 --> 07:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that it's it's
 
07:48:22.958 --> 07:48:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that it's it's
functioning

07:48:23.990 --> 07:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
functioning
 
07:48:26.070 --> 07:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
um and those kinds of things
 
07:48:26.080 --> 07:48:28.310 align:start position:0%
um and those kinds of things
um

07:48:28.310 --> 07:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:48:30.310 --> 07:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
theoretically some of these can be can
 
07:48:32.070 --> 07:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
do even more advanced things but that's
 
07:48:33.910 --> 07:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
in broad strokes those are the big
 
07:48:36.230 --> 07:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
differences between them thank you and
 
07:48:38.310 --> 07:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow up
 
07:48:39.910 --> 07:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
well representative you've already had
 
07:48:41.830 --> 07:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
your follow-up you took it i didn't give
 
07:48:43.830 --> 07:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
it to you but you took it uh you had two
 
07:48:45.670 --> 07:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you very much for
 
07:48:45.680 --> 07:48:46.830 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you very much for
that

07:48:46.830 --> 07:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:48:49.030 --> 07:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
um we have to move on we have many other
 
07:48:50.708 --> 07:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh speakers
 
07:48:53.270 --> 07:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh i don't see any other oh i'm sorry i
 
07:48:55.350 --> 07:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
see uh representative
 
07:48:56.948 --> 07:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
minardi has to stand up for a question
 
07:48:56.958 --> 07:49:04.788 align:start position:0%
minardi has to stand up for a question
please

07:49:04.788 --> 07:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:08.310 --> 07:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
mr christ said that hb 315 preserves
 
07:49:10.788 --> 07:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
default service to the detriment of
 
07:49:13.510 --> 07:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
aggregation in the ratepayers do you see
 
07:49:16.150 --> 07:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
that as true
 
07:49:16.160 --> 07:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
that as true
uh

07:49:17.030 --> 07:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:49:18.708 --> 07:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
i don't suppose it will surprise you to
 
07:49:21.270 --> 07:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
say i do not um
 
07:49:24.150 --> 07:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
as as ms gamache said it um
 
07:49:25.430 --> 07:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
we have no
 
07:49:28.468 --> 07:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
desire or intent to impede the roll out
 
07:49:31.190 --> 07:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
of community aggregation and by that we
 
07:49:32.310 --> 07:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
mean the
 
07:49:34.468 --> 07:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
um the grouping together of customers to
 
07:49:35.430 --> 07:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
give them
 
07:49:37.510 --> 07:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
greater buying power and the ability to
 
07:49:39.830 --> 07:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
set their own priorities for an energy
 
07:49:39.840 --> 07:49:41.430 align:start position:0%
set their own priorities for an energy
mix

07:49:41.430 --> 07:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
mix
 
07:49:43.030 --> 07:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that's not something we have any
 
07:49:45.510 --> 07:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
desire to stop or slow down and we
 
07:49:48.070 --> 07:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that having customers served
 
07:49:50.948 --> 07:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
that way will have an impact on default
 
07:49:50.958 --> 07:49:52.310 align:start position:0%
that way will have an impact on default
service

07:49:52.310 --> 07:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
service
 
07:49:55.030 --> 07:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that is an impact that can be dealt
 
07:49:55.040 --> 07:49:56.388 align:start position:0%
and that is an impact that can be dealt
with

07:49:56.388 --> 07:49:56.398 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:49:58.548 --> 07:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
if it's done in a relatively orderly
 
07:49:58.558 --> 07:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
if it's done in a relatively orderly
fashion

07:49:59.670 --> 07:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
07:50:01.910 --> 07:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh i think where our disagreement may
 
07:50:03.990 --> 07:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
lie is in some of the issues you've
 
07:50:05.990 --> 07:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
heard talked about uh for instance the
 
07:50:06.000 --> 07:50:07.350 align:start position:0%
heard talked about uh for instance the
timing

07:50:07.350 --> 07:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
timing
 
07:50:10.548 --> 07:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
for these aggregations to begin
 
07:50:11.910 --> 07:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the impact that would have on
 
07:50:13.350 --> 07:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
default service
 
07:50:16.070 --> 07:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
our concern there is that
 
07:50:18.388 --> 07:50:18.398 align:start position:0%
in the intent to achieve the best price
 
07:50:21.110 --> 07:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
possible for that aggregation
 
07:50:23.510 --> 07:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
it may have a large number of customers
 
07:50:25.270 --> 07:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
leave or return
 
07:50:29.030 --> 07:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
to default service at inopportune times
 
07:50:31.510 --> 07:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
and that could lead to increased cost
 
07:50:31.520 --> 07:50:32.628 align:start position:0%
and that could lead to increased cost
for

07:50:32.628 --> 07:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:50:34.468 --> 07:50:34.478 align:start position:0%
any customers remaining on default
 
07:50:34.478 --> 07:50:35.830 align:start position:0%
any customers remaining on default
service

07:50:35.830 --> 07:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
07:50:38.788 --> 07:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
and so that that's our concern there
 
07:50:41.510 --> 07:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
but ultimately if if aggregation was to
 
07:50:43.590 --> 07:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
spread and cover virtually every
 
07:50:43.600 --> 07:50:44.948 align:start position:0%
spread and cover virtually every
community

07:50:44.948 --> 07:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
community
 
07:50:46.868 --> 07:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
and default service would remain only
 
07:50:49.190 --> 07:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
for a tiny minority
 
07:50:51.750 --> 07:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
then that's what will happen and i don't
 
07:50:53.430 --> 07:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
think that we have any problem with that
 
07:50:53.440 --> 07:50:55.590 align:start position:0%
think that we have any problem with that
happening

07:50:55.590 --> 07:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
happening
 
07:50:57.910 --> 07:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
our concerns aren't with uh with that
 
07:51:00.708 --> 07:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:02.070 --> 07:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
07:51:02.080 --> 07:51:02.948 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
um

07:51:02.948 --> 07:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:51:04.628 --> 07:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
in the interest uh we're trying to get
 
07:51:06.948 --> 07:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
one more uh testifier in here before the
 
07:51:09.510 --> 07:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
end of the day and so um
 
07:51:12.628 --> 07:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
i will move on to our next uh speaker
 
07:51:15.910 --> 07:51:15.920 align:start position:0%

the section of hp 315 which we're most
 
07:52:07.030 --> 07:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
interested in is the section that
 
07:52:08.948 --> 07:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
actually referenced
 
07:52:10.548 --> 07:52:10.558 align:start position:0%

07:52:17.510 --> 07:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
who choose to opt out of a community
 
07:52:19.350 --> 07:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
choice aggregation program it's
 
07:52:19.360 --> 07:52:20.708 align:start position:0%
choice aggregation program it's
problematic

07:52:20.708 --> 07:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
07:52:23.270 --> 07:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
incentive costs are neither well defined
 
07:52:25.030 --> 07:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
nor restricted in any way under the
 
07:52:26.948 --> 07:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
current statute
 
07:52:29.350 --> 07:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
could it include startup costs ongoing
 
07:52:31.510 --> 07:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
operational costs
 
07:52:32.788 --> 07:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
there is one potential cost to
 
07:52:34.310 --> 07:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
non-participants that concerns us more
 
07:52:36.150 --> 07:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
than any other and that is the potential
 
07:52:37.990 --> 07:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
for an exit fee charged to customers who
 
07:52:41.110 --> 07:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
choose to opt out of a cca program
 
07:52:43.110 --> 07:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
after its implementation
 
07:52:45.430 --> 07:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
while this may seem unlikely exit fees
 
07:52:47.190 --> 07:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
have been proposed and enacted in other
 
07:52:47.200 --> 07:52:48.468 align:start position:0%
have been proposed and enacted in other
states

07:52:48.468 --> 07:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
states
 
07:52:50.628 --> 07:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
in california for example a power charge
 
07:52:52.150 --> 07:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
in different amount
 
07:52:53.830 --> 07:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
which is essentially an exit fee on
 
07:52:56.070 --> 07:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
customers leaving standard offer servers
 
07:52:58.948 --> 07:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
to two cca programs
 
07:53:00.628 --> 07:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
was authorized by the public utilities
 
07:53:02.230 --> 07:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
commission of california to account for
 
07:53:05.670 --> 07:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
lost load and other legacy costs there
 
07:53:08.548 --> 07:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
maryland recently had a cca bill
 
07:53:11.110 --> 07:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
which was introduced in 2020
 
07:53:13.110 --> 07:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
it ended up dying due to you know due to
 
07:53:14.388 --> 07:53:14.398 align:start position:0%
cove probably
 
07:53:15.990 --> 07:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
but it included language that gave the
 
07:53:17.510 --> 07:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
public service commission in maryland
 
07:53:20.548 --> 07:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
oversight over any exit fees
 
07:53:22.230 --> 07:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
now whether or not these exit fees are
 
07:53:24.150 --> 07:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
necessary is debatable
 
07:53:25.990 --> 07:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
but the common denominator of commission
 
07:53:29.750 --> 07:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
oversight in each of these scenarios
 
07:53:31.270 --> 07:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
isn't guaranteed under the current
 
07:53:33.990 --> 07:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
community choice aggregation statute
 
07:53:37.110 --> 07:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
um as mayor don just referenced you know
 
07:53:38.948 --> 07:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that a great many
 
07:53:40.868 --> 07:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
consumers including low and fixed
 
07:53:43.510 --> 07:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
customers won't initially be aware that
 
07:53:45.670 --> 07:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
they are now receiving their power by
 
07:53:47.270 --> 07:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
community aggregation
 
07:53:49.270 --> 07:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
we should protect consumer choice by
 
07:53:50.868 --> 07:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
ensuring that those customers and those
 
07:53:52.868 --> 07:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
who choose to opt out aren't charged
 
07:53:54.948 --> 07:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
excessive fees or become responsible for
 
07:53:56.388 --> 07:53:56.398 align:start position:0%
other poorly defined
 
07:53:57.830 --> 07:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
and unrestrained
 
07:53:59.350 --> 07:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
incidental costs
 
07:54:01.670 --> 07:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be clear cea is not opposed to
 
07:54:03.590 --> 07:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
community choice segregation in new
 
07:54:05.670 --> 07:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire but current law opens a
 
07:54:07.430 --> 07:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
pandora's box to potential costs that
 
07:54:09.910 --> 07:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
could hold consumers captive to cca
 
07:54:11.430 --> 07:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
programs and restrict their ability to
 
07:54:14.230 --> 07:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
choose their electricity supply 30
 
07:54:14.240 --> 07:54:15.910 align:start position:0%
choose their electricity supply 30
seconds

07:54:15.910 --> 07:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
07:54:18.708 --> 07:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
hb 15 hp 315 would eliminate that
 
07:54:20.708 --> 07:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
possibility and for that reason on
 
07:54:22.948 --> 07:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
behalf of cea i urge you to recommend
 
07:54:24.388 --> 07:54:24.398 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:54:25.750 --> 07:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that i'll take any
 
07:54:28.468 --> 07:54:28.478 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the bill
 
07:54:30.628 --> 07:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr brown for your testimony
 
07:54:33.030 --> 07:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
well appreciated
 
07:54:36.150 --> 07:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
mike mike chair you're mike sutton
 
07:54:37.110 --> 07:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:54:39.670 --> 07:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony well appreciated
 
07:54:41.430 --> 07:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh i keep forgetting that i gotta leave
 
07:54:42.948 --> 07:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
the button alone instead of holding it
 
07:54:44.150 --> 07:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
down but
 
07:54:46.628 --> 07:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh moving on i see a hand up by uh
 
07:54:46.638 --> 07:54:47.750 align:start position:0%
uh moving on i see a hand up by uh
represent

07:54:47.750 --> 07:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
07:54:49.910 --> 07:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
kelly pitts for a question please
 
07:54:52.708 --> 07:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
one question i have is we keep repre
 
07:54:55.830 --> 07:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
we keep uh referencing community power
 
07:54:57.750 --> 07:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i guess i want a definition of
 
07:54:59.510 --> 07:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
community power
 
07:55:02.230 --> 07:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
and aggregation how large can these
 
07:55:03.830 --> 07:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
systems become
 
07:55:07.430 --> 07:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
can they be you know a town a city a
 
07:55:07.440 --> 07:55:09.350 align:start position:0%
can they be you know a town a city a
region

07:55:09.350 --> 07:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
region
 
07:55:11.190 --> 07:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
a county
 
07:55:14.310 --> 07:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have any parameters on
 
07:55:14.320 --> 07:55:15.750 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody have any parameters on
that

07:55:15.750 --> 07:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:55:18.230 --> 07:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think it's limited i think
 
07:55:19.190 --> 07:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:55:20.468 --> 07:55:20.478 align:start position:0%
i think if
 
07:55:21.990 --> 07:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
a network communities want to sign up
 
07:55:23.510 --> 07:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
they can they can do that i don't think
 
07:55:25.190 --> 07:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
there's any restrictions there not to my
 
07:55:27.510 --> 07:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
understanding anyway
 
07:55:30.388 --> 07:55:30.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:30.398 --> 07:55:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:55:31.750 --> 07:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:55:34.628 --> 07:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
in in in your experience in other
 
07:55:37.030 --> 07:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
communities or other states
 
07:55:39.350 --> 07:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
up to people um
 
07:55:43.190 --> 07:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
do areas join in other words portsmouth
 
07:55:43.200 --> 07:55:45.430 align:start position:0%
do areas join in other words portsmouth
greenland

07:55:45.430 --> 07:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
greenland
 
07:55:45.440 --> 07:55:46.548 align:start position:0%
greenland
pitterie

07:55:46.548 --> 07:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
pitterie
 
07:55:50.230 --> 07:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
can we get together and do all this
 
07:55:51.750 --> 07:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure you could do it across
 
07:55:54.150 --> 07:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
state lines um and i and i'm not saying
 
07:55:55.830 --> 07:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
you can't i'm just i'm not sure how that
 
07:55:57.030 --> 07:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
would work okay
 
07:56:00.548 --> 07:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
i i i doubt you could but um yeah it's
 
07:56:02.310 --> 07:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know in california communities have
 
07:56:05.030 --> 07:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
joined together to purchase you know
 
07:56:05.040 --> 07:56:06.310 align:start position:0%
joined together to purchase you know
characters

07:56:06.310 --> 07:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
characters
 
07:56:08.230 --> 07:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
the right to join community aggregation
 
07:56:10.468 --> 07:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
programs so thank you
 
07:56:12.350 --> 07:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you before we move on to
 
07:56:17.990 --> 07:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:19.430 --> 07:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry

thank you okay thank you very much
 
07:56:26.628 --> 07:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative sam please you have a
 
07:56:27.990 --> 07:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
question please
 
07:56:30.070 --> 07:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you mr chairman and thank
 
07:56:32.230 --> 07:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
you mr brown for sending my question
 
07:56:34.230 --> 07:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
first of all mr brown i'm not familiar
 
07:56:35.990 --> 07:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the organization you represent can
 
07:56:38.388 --> 07:56:38.398 align:start position:0%
you uh tell me what the name of that is
 
07:56:41.110 --> 07:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
again consumer energy alliance i emailed
 
07:56:43.430 --> 07:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
the committee um i think earlier in the
 
07:56:47.110 --> 07:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
week it's a national organization um
 
07:56:50.868 --> 07:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
we have over 300 business and you know
 
07:56:53.030 --> 07:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
members um you have the list of members
 
07:56:55.030 --> 07:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
in an email that i sent you
 
07:56:55.040 --> 07:56:56.830 align:start position:0%
in an email that i sent you
um

07:56:56.830 --> 07:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:59.750 --> 07:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay i gave a brief explanation to what
 
07:57:02.388 --> 07:57:02.398 align:start position:0%
we who we are in in my introduction
 
07:57:06.388 --> 07:57:06.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:09.430 --> 07:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh so mr brown uh is that is a list of
 
07:57:13.030 --> 07:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
your supporters available publicly
 
07:57:14.708 --> 07:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely so let me give you an example
 
07:57:16.310 --> 07:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
of some of our members the u.s chamber
 
07:57:18.388 --> 07:57:18.398 align:start position:0%
of commerce national association
 
07:57:21.030 --> 07:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
national association of manufacturers
 
07:57:22.468 --> 07:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
energy companies
 
07:57:24.310 --> 07:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
we as i mentioned you know we are a
 
07:57:26.388 --> 07:57:26.398 align:start position:0%
mixture of producers and consumers
 
07:57:26.398 --> 07:57:28.230 align:start position:0%
mixture of producers and consumers
so

07:57:28.230 --> 07:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:57:29.990 --> 07:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
did you send us will you send us that
 
07:57:30.000 --> 07:57:30.948 align:start position:0%
did you send us will you send us that
list

07:57:30.948 --> 07:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
list
 
07:57:33.350 --> 07:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
i did and i sent you a link with both
 
07:57:36.070 --> 07:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
the members and the board of directors
 
07:57:38.830 --> 07:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're
 
07:57:41.190 --> 07:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
welcome representative mckee her
 
07:57:44.310 --> 07:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:47.430 --> 07:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh mr chairman i i just
 
07:57:49.110 --> 07:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that i i think we're
 
07:57:50.310 --> 07:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
at five o'clock and i just wanted to
 
07:57:52.070 --> 07:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
mention there's a lot of people left so
 
07:57:54.708 --> 07:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
are we gonna have additional time for
 
07:57:56.150 --> 07:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
this hearing or how is that going to
 
07:57:57.750 --> 07:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
work are we going to continue now
 
07:57:59.190 --> 07:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
because i know we usually stop right at
 
07:58:00.388 --> 07:58:00.398 align:start position:0%
five because there's people that want to
 
07:58:02.388 --> 07:58:02.398 align:start position:0%
leave the building
 
07:58:04.868 --> 07:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
