44
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.000
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

45
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.500
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

The House will now attend to a communication.

121
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.500
In a letter dated Monday, December 2nd, Hello Mr.

122
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.500
Clerk Smith.

123
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:26.500
I am writing to let you know that I am going to forego my position as State Representative for District 12 in New Hampshire because I am moving out of my district as of December 31st.

124
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:40.000
I will not come over to be sworn in and I will not be serving as the representative that I was elected to be for this district.

125
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I do hope to help out in other ways in my new district down the road.

126
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.500
Thank you for your help, Don Evans.

127
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500
This resignation is accepted with regret.

128
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.500
We will now begin the process of the roll call.

129
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.500
This roll call is done alphabetically by county.

130
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.500
I will begin with Belknap County.

131
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:21.000
If you have a similar or same name as another member from a different county, please be mindful of which county I am announcing when I say your name.

132
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:30.500
If there are two with the same name in the same county, I will say their first name first.

133
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.000
A couple of bullet points before I begin, however.

134
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
You are seated where you are supposed to be today.

135
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:49.000
You will find your oath slips either in front of you, in your seat pockets, or underneath you.

136
00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:02.000
If you look to your front and you do not have an oath slip there, then please check underneath your seat because it is likely there.

137
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:25.000
If there is a problem in a little while and for whatever reason you don't have that oath slip, which I will find extremely hard to believe because myself and Paul Bryan put them there yesterday afternoon, then we will print a new one for you.

138
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Do not sign them until I tell you to, please.

139
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:49.500
If anyone comes in during the process of the roll call and misses the vote, excuse me, and misses my calling their name, please send them down to me at the conclusion and I will record them as present.

140
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.500
We will begin with Belknap County.

141
00:13:52.500 --> 00:14:00.000

First, wholeheartedly, on behalf of myself and the Executive Council, congratulations to all those who ran great races.

554
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:40.500
A huge thank you to all the families that are joining us because as they have all learned, if they haven't learned already, campaigns stink.

555
00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.500
Campaigns can be really, really hard.

556
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.500
They're a grind.

557
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:51.500
They're so important, but they can be really hard on families sometimes.

558
00:31:51.500 --> 00:32:12.500
And again, I was saying this, and I think I say it every other year, there is really no place, no place in this entire country where you have a legislative body so dedicated to service, regardless of party, political affiliation, philosophy.

559
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:18.000
We all know you ain't doing it for the paycheck, right?

560
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:37.000
So it really is, and that's something that is an amazing checks and balance, an amazing driver of community involvement and engagement, that it is truly a volunteer legislature, the largest of its kind anywhere to be found.

561
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:51.000
And if you do the math, 400 representatives for only 1.4 million people, it is truly the most representative body of government on the face of planet Earth.

562
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.500
And that's an amazing thing to take a long time in.

563
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.000
I think it gives everybody a lot of confidence.

564
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And even when we don't get it exactly right, and every once in a while government doesn't get it exactly right, it's still way better than everybody else.

565
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.500
So that's the important part.

566
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:28.000
So I'll ask all the members of the House of Representatives to raise your right hand and please repeat after me.

567
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:47.500
I state your name of your city or town do solemnly swear that I will bear faith in true allegiance to the United States of America and the state of New Hampshire and and will support the constitutions thereof.

568
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.500
and will support the constitutions thereof.

569
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.500
So help me God, I state your name.

570
00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:20.000
Do solemnly and sincerely swear and affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as State Representative according to the best of my abilities, agreeably to to the rules and regulations of this Constitution and the laws of the state of New Hampshire.

571
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
So help me God.

572
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Congratulations.

573
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Thank you.

574
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.500
and pass them to your left, and my staff will come and retrieve them up the aisles.

575
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.500
Thank you.

576
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500
You can sit.

577
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500
Thank you.

578
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.500
Gracias.

579
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500
Thank you.

580
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.500
.

581
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:54.500
Will representatives Mcdonnell and Wheeler please come to the front to see me for a moment.

582
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
Thank you.

583
00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:03.500
McDonnell and Wheeler, please come to the front to see me for a moment.

584
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500
Gracias.

585
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.500
Have all members passed in their oath sheets?

586
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.500
Thank you.

587
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.500
The House will come to order.

588
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:29.000
The chair has proposed ground rules for the election of speaker, which have been reviewed by those candidates for speaker and they have been printed in your House calendar.

589
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.500
Representatives Packard and Simpson move the adoption of the ground rules for election.

590
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.500
The question is on the adoption of those ground rules.

591
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.500
Are you ready for the question?

592
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.500
All those in favor say aye.

593
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.500
Aye.

594
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.500
All those opposed nay.

595
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:56.500
The ayes have it and the rules for election have been adopted.

596
00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:04.500
Before I begin the nominations for speaker I just wanted to explain how speeches are timed.

597
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.000
The chair keeps a stopwatch.

598
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
The time starts when a member starts talking and stops when they stop talking.

599
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Their walk down time does not count, just for clarification.

600
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.500
Nominations for speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives are in order.

601
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:34.000
The chair recognizes the member from Walpole, Representative Lucy Weber, for the purpose of making a nomination.

602
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Thank you, Mr.

603
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Clerk.

604
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.500
I rise today to nominate Representative Alexis Simpson for Speaker of the New Hampshire House.

605
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:57.000
For those of you who do not know her, Representative Simpson brings a wealth of life experience to her work in the legislature.

606
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.000
She has a bachelor's degree in physics and master's degrees in divinity and theology.

607
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.500
She's worked in agricultural policy and advocacy, focusing on sustainable agriculture.

608
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:18.000
And she is a pastor with all the complexities and responsibilities of that job, including pastoral counseling.

609
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:31.000
In her time in the House, Representative Simpson has served on the Environment and Agriculture Committee, the Judiciary Committee, and the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee.

610
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.500
For the last two years, Representative Simpson has served as a minority leader here in the House.

611
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:50.500
As such, she has worked with members of both parties to ensure that the work of the New Hampshire House progresses smoothly.

612
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:56.500
She's familiar with all aspects and challenges of the job of Speaker.

613
00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:03.000
We all see the Speaker weekly as the presiding officer of this body.

614
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:22.000
But there's so much more to the Speaker's job, ensuring that the committee process works smoothly, crafting of the biennial budget to the most deadlines, ensuring the decorum is preserved in this chamber and in the committee rooms.

615
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Responsibility for the safety of the members of this body, the staff who work here, and the members of the general public.

616
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
The staff who work here, and the members of the general public.

617
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
The staff who work here, and the members of the general public.

618
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.500
of this body, the staff who work here, and the members of the general public.

619
00:38:52.500 --> 00:39:04.000
Oversight of all of the functions of the legislative branch, working with the Senate, working with the legislative staff, both partisan and nonpartisan.

620
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Oh, and the challenge of the management and preservation of three historic buildings with all their quirks, not to mention the ongoing construction just outside our windows of a new parking garage.

621
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:29.500
Representative Simpson has forged relationships with House members of both parties, with senators and with our legislative staff members.

622
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:37.500
She is able to bring people together to take groups with disparate interests and forge consensus.

623
00:39:37.500 --> 00:40:03.000
She is uniquely qualified to identify the strengths each member brings to the work of the House and to create a climate in which members use the talents and experience they bring with them to the fullest and offering opportunities for members to develop the skills to take on new challenges.

624
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:23.500
Representative Simpson is particularly qualified to ensure that the House has run along principles of fairness, respect, and decorum for all members, majority and minority alike, fostering full and robust debates about policy while preserving an atmosphere of respect and collegiality.

625
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:43.500
Finally, Representative Simpson brings to a difficult job a sense of humor, a bit of humility, a great laugh, a sense of optimism, and an overwhelming enthusiasm for the work of this house and for the well-being of her colleagues.

626
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:51.500
I hope you will join me in voting for Alexis Simpson as our next House Speaker.

627
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.500
Thank you, Mr.

628
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.500
Clerk.

629
00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:02.500
Representative Lucy Webber places the name of Representative Alexis Simpson in nomination for Speaker.

630
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:11.000
The chair recognizes the member from Milford, Representative Peter Petrigno, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

631
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Thank you, Mr.

632
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Clerk.

633
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Colleagues, it is my honor to second the nomination of Reverend Alexis Simpson as our next speaker and to indulge her consideration in supporting her candidacy.

634
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:50.500
Alexis was first elected to this chamber 10 years ago, bringing a strong sense of social responsibility and a commitment to do good in service of the people of New Hampshire and her Rockingham district serving the towns of Exeter, Newsfields, New Market, and Stratum.

635
00:41:50.500 --> 00:42:06.000
Now entering her fourth term, Alexis has been an effective and accomplished legislator, a member of the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee, the Environment and Agriculture Committee, and the Judiciary Committee.

636
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:18.500
As the deputy Democratic leader, she has proven herself to work effectively, respectfully, and cooperatively, not only with leadership but with all, regardless of party.

637
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:33.500
In addition to being an experienced and dedicated legislator, Alexis is married, a mother of two teenage boys, and a caring, empathetic clergywoman, a person of integrity, veracity, and prayerfulness.

638
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:41.500
She holds a bachelor's degree in physics, a master's in divinity, and a master's in technology.

639
00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:56.000
The work experience includes service as the executive director of the Waysmead Center United Campus Ministry to UNH, providing compassionate direct service to New Hampshire's seacoast and surrounding communities.

640
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:07.000
As the bridge pastor of the First Congregational Church in Hancock, andim Ministries in Greenland and Salem, just to name a few.

641
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Alexis has dedicated herself to public service for the common good, both here in the People's House and in the Lord's House.

642
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Colleagues, clearly Alexa Simpson brings legislative experience, institutional knowledge, leadership skills, and an honorable character which will lead us fairly and objectively.

643
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Her thoughtful leadership style and strong moral ethical compass is one which unites people.

644
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000
She will ensure decorum and be a leader for all House members.

645
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.500
I am confident that Alexis Simpson will provide us with the leadership you can trust.

646
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:55.500
And please join me in electing Alexis Simpson as our next speaker.

647
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.500
Thank you very much.

648
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.500
Representative Peter Petrigno seconds the nomination of Representative Alexis Simpson.

649
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.500
The chair recognizes the member from Exeter, Representative Alexis Simpson.

650
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.500
Thank you Mr.

651
00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:17.000
Chair and thank you to the representatives from Walpole and Milford for those generous words.

652
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.500
Good morning, colleagues, and congratulations on being elected to the New Hampshire House.

653
00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:38.000
Thank you for making the commitment to your constituents to serve Granite Staters and to spend the next two years making government work for the people of New Hampshire.

654
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:46.500
My name is Alexis Simpson, and I'm running to be the speaker of the New Hampshire House.

655
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:52.000
All of us arrived in our seats today from different paths.

656
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Mine started when my older child was in fourth grade.

657
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:14.000
I first ran for State House then because, like many of you, I wanted to make the world, and particularly New Hampshire, a better place, a better place for him and for his classmates.

658
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:28.500
For me that meant making sure that they all had access to healthy local food because healthy food leads to healthy kids and healthy kids leads to healthy communities.

659
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:39.000
Here in New Hampshire we have a vibrant local food system that strengthens our rural communities and helps them thrive economically.

660
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.500
I still believe we could do more to encourage Thank you.

661
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:54.500
In New Hampshire, we have a vibrant local food system that strengthens our rural communities and helps them thrive economically.

662
00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:03.500
I still believe we could do more to encourage our local food system and enliven our rural communities.

663
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:21.000
But it was 15 years ago that I helped start my own town's farm to school program, and I still maintain that vision and work toward that goal for our children and for our communities.

664
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.500
For several years, I sponsored farm-to-school legislation, and we finally passed a farm-to-school pilot program last year.

665
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:35.500
It was a bipartisan effort, as so much great legislation often is.

666
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:49.500
In my personal life, I continue to invest in local farms, including going out of my way, to buy local food and support producers from throughout our region.

667
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:58.500
Local food producers are, after all, small businesses, and without them, our local economies and communities would falter.

668
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:09.000
We all have stories that we come with this morning, stories that inspire the policy that we care so much about.

669
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Maybe the policy that inspired you to run for office was making sure all Granite Staters can afford their housing.

670
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.500
Maybe it's to ensure students receive the services they need to obtain a high-quality education.

671
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:32.000
Maybe you want to keep your neighbors and your families safe.

672
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Whatever it is, whatever bill you want to pass and send to the governor's desk, you cannot do it alone.

673
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.500
None of us Thank you.

674
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.500
and your families safe.

675
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:56.500
Whatever it is, whatever bill you want to pass and send to the governor's desk, you cannot do it alone.

676
00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.500
None of us can.

677
00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:06.000
We need to work together in this body to make the changes that we envision.

678
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Today I'm running to be your next speaker of the house because we need a leader who can bring people together across differences to reach a common goal.

679
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.500
For 25 years I I have been a faith leader in my community.

680
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:39.500
Whether I was pastoring a church, working as a chaplain, running a spiritually based nonprofit, or teaching Sunday school, I bring people together around common values.

681
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:45.500
I've led interfaith work by understanding and considering others lives and identities.

682
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:51.500
I pride myself on being both collaborative and decisive, compassionate and data-driven.

683
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:59.500
I will listen to you and respect you, even if and when we view policies differently.

684
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:03.000
The next two years will be tough.

685
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
We're facing a difficult budget season.

686
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:16.000
We had a difficult time last time, too, but together we can do it when we center Granite State values.

687
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Our constituents will be watching what we do here because it will affect their daily lives.

688
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:47.500
As the only woman in my university class to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Physics, and as the first woman minister in three rural churches before the age of 30, I'm used to working with and leading people who see the world differently than I do.

689
00:49:47.500 --> 00:50:04.000
Yet I firmly believe you do not have to be the biggest bully or have the loudest voice to be a strong leader, to stand up for what is right for Granite Staters.

690
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Your vote today will decide how this chamber, this body, this building will be led for the next two years.

691
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:35.000
As a legislator, as a leader, as a person, I stand strong in my core values while always recognizing that the person across the table from me, whether that person's on my side of the aisle or not, is a human being.

692
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:48.500
As speaker, I will make sure that we strive to respect each other in the hallways, the committee rooms, and through every floor speech and parliamentary inquiry.

693
00:50:48.500 --> 00:51:02.500
We must hold tight to our own humanity and remember the humanity of each of our colleagues and our constituents through our actions here as New Hampshire lawmakers.

694
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:14.000
Today I'm ready to lead and stand beside you as we work to make New Hampshire a better place for all Granite Staters.

695
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:30.500
Throughout these next two years, the 400 of us gathered here had the opportunity and and more important, the responsibility, to make our state more affordable and more hospitable than it is now.

696
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.000
We can do this together.

697
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.000
When you receive your ballot, I ask for you to vote for Alexa Simpson for speaker.

698
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Thank you.

699
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.500
The member from Exeter, Representative Alexis Simpson, has accepted her nomination.

700
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.000
Further nominations are in order.

701
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:59.500
The chair recognizes the member from Goffstown, Representative Lisa Mazur, for the purpose of making a nomination.

702
00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.500
Thank you, Mr.

703
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.500
Clerk.

704
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:09.000
Good morning, esteemed colleagues, members of this honorable chamber, and guests.

705
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:19.500
It is my privilege to rise today to nominate Sherman, Sherm, Packard, as Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

706
00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:28.500
For the past 34 years, Sherm has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the principles that define our great state.

707
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:36.500
Limited government, individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and a deep respect for the voice of the people.

708
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:45.500
These values guide our work here in the Granite State and must shape the leadership of this chamber.

709
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:52.000
Sherm has proven to be a steadfast leader and a dedicated public servant.

710
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:05.500
With his extensive experience, he has championed legislation that supports parental rights, strengthens our economy, safeguards personal freedoms, and ensures that every tax dollar is spent wisely.

711
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:13.500
But more than policy, Sherm embodies the qualities of leadership we need at this critical juncture.

712
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:20.500
He listens to all perspectives, builds consensus, and upholds the dignity of this institution.

713
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:29.000
In an era where decisions often dominate, SHRM reminds us of the power of collaboration and respect.

714
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:37.500
As Speaker, SHRM will continue to lead with integrity, transparency, and a clear vision for the future.

715
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:45.500
He will keep his door open and ensure that this House remains a beacon of democracy.

716
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:54.500
He will support legislation that protects New Hampshire and preserves our live free or die way of life.

717
00:53:54.500 --> 00:54:09.000
Make no mistake, as a result of his solid leadership, the committee to elect House Republicans was instrumental in securing a historic 44-seat working Republican majority in the House.

718
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
We are at a critical moment in New Hampshire's history.

719
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:24.000
The decisions we make in this chamber, even today, will impact the lives of our citizens for generations to come.

720
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:33.500
In the words of Sherm, and I quote, the key to our success is sticking together as one team.

721
00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:42.000
And with that unity, we will continue to move New Hampshire forward, keeping it safe and free.

722
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
End quote.

723
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I have no doubt that Sherman Packard, Sherm, is the right person to lead this House.

724
00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:02.000
I urge my colleagues to support this nomination and to join me in electing Sherm Packard in nomination for speaker.

725
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:10.500
The chair recognizes the member from Hudson, Representative Kim Rice, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

726
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.500
Good afternoon, everyone.

727
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:18.000
I'm sure you're thinking that the clerk clearly made a mistake.

728
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:37.500
But after a rather lively conversation and assurances that I can live with and that I I believe those that supported me can live with, I rise to second the nomination of Sherm Packer for Speaker of the House.

729
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.500
Thank you.

730
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.500
All right, everybody.

731
00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.000
All right, thank you, everyone.

732
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Thank you.

733
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
All right, everybody.

734
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.500
All right, thank you, everyone.

735
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.500
You know, I served under Sherm.

736
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.500
We have a great opportunity here.

737
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.500
We have a very large majority.

738
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:05.000
Let's do great things for the live free or die state.

739
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:26.000
I hope you'll join me in supporting Sherm packard for speaker of the house thank you representative kim rice seconds the nomination of representative sherman packard the chair recognizes the member from bedford representative tedorski, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

740
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Thank you, Mr.

741
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Clerk.

742
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:38.500
I stand in support in the nomination of Sharon Packard for the next Speaker of the House.

743
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:52.000
My support is not only as a state rep, but as my advocation as a leadership coach who has coached executives for close to 25 years worldwide.

744
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.500
There are three characteristics that I'd like to highlight about Sherm.

745
00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.500
Number one, how he handles conflict.

746
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:06.500
Recently, Sherm and I had a difference of opinion on an issue.

747
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:15.500
And after the issue played out, we were emailing back and forth, and I decided to call Sherm.

748
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.000
But Sherm beat me to the punch.

749
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000
He actually called me, and we had a great conversation.

750
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:36.500
As the call ended, it was evident to me that SHRM did not harbor any bad feelings, but his goal was to maintain the relationship.

751
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.000
Let me just say this.

752
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.500
This behavior is atypical for most of the executives that I work with.

753
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:52.000
They usually harbor these bad feelings and don't try to maintain the relationship.

754
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:59.000
SHRM is able to do that, which is a great trait for a speaker.

755
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Second, his level-headedness.

756
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.500
In most instances in the past years, I've seen SHRM stay calm and composed in tough situations.

757
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:16.500
This can be difficult for some, but SHRM always stayed balanced in tough times.

758
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:27.500
Again, procedures on how the House works and what needs to get done for the House as well as New Hampshire constituents.

759
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:42.000
So in closing, based on these characteristics, I support SHRM, and I hope that you will too in vote for SHRM Packard for the next Speaker of the House.

760
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Thank you, Mr.

761
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Clark.

762
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Representative Gorski seconds the nomination of Representative Packard.

763
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
The chair recognizes the member from Lenonderry, Representative Sherman Packard.

764
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Thank you, Mr.

765
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.500
Clerk, and thank you for those words.

766
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:04.500
We've got two tough years ahead of us.

767
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:11.500
Philosophically, in many cases, we are going to have different opinions on subject matter.

768
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.500
I think that Representative Simpson and I disagree on that.

769
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:23.000
We are going to have a vast amount of difference on subject matter.

770
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:35.000
But by God, that doesn't mean we can't be civil and friendly and cooperate with each other when we are on the same page.

771
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:42.000
We do not need to do any name calling or any of that stuff.

772
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.500
I wish Twitter and Facebook didn't exist, because I think it would be better for our society.

773
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.000
But having said that, they do exist.

774
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:04.000
So all I ask of all of you on both sides of the aisle is that we respect each other.

775
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And we make sure that we can have a civil conversation, and we can disagree, but we can still have that conversation.

776
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
My door is open.

777
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It has been for the last four years since I've been speaker.

778
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:42.000
If anybody in this room wants to come and talk to me and I'm not tied up in a meeting, the door is open for you to come in, and that goes for both sides of the aisle.

779
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.500
I've had that open-door policy for for four years and I intend on keeping it.

780
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:57.000
I truly believe that as a body, we can get through the next two years.

781
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.500
We can do it civilly.

782
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:06.500
We can do what's best for the citizens of the state of New Hampshire.

783
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:16.500
Now we may disagree on that from my friends over here, but we can do it in a civil manner.

784
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:30.500
So all I'm asking everybody in this room is let's make sure that we are civil to each other, regardless of how we feel on a particular issue.

785
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.500
Thank you.

786
01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.500
Representative Sherman Packard accepts the nomination.

787
01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:41.000
With no further nominations, the chair declares nominations for speaker closed.

788
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.500
At this time, I would ask all members to please take their seats so that we can begin distributing ballots for the election of speaker.

789
01:01:53.500 --> 01:02:02.000
As you can see, my staff here in the well is coming out to pass out ballots.

790
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.500
Please do not mark them until I have completed my instructions.

791
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.500
Balloting will be done by division.

792
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.000
When you have marked your ballot, please remain seated.

793
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I will call each division up.

794
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
There are two ballots boxes in the front of the chamber and two in the back.

795
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:35.500
Number one is on your left near the chamber door and is for A through E, as clearly marked.

796
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:43.500
Number two is in the back and to the right and is for F through L.

797
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:58.000
Number three is in the back on the left is for M through P and number four is on your right in the front designated as Q through Z.

798
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
It is important that you use the correct ballot box.

799
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Staff members from the House Clerk's Office and Republican and Democratic offices will be stationed at each box.

800
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Before you deposit your ballot in the box, please clearly state your name so the staff person may check your name off.

801
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:41.500
For the ease of traffic flow in the front and the back, please do not leave your seat until your division is called, and then please return to your seat via an aisle away from your division.

802
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:49.000
The staff of the clerk's office and the Republican and Democratic offices will be thus.

803
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.500
For boxes A through E is Paul Bryant and Slate Goodwin.

804
01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:00.000
Box two F through L is Michael Ko and Dan Mason.

805
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Box three is Theresa Preston and Rachel Potter.

806
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.500
And down here is Tracy Blanchard and Sean Connor.

807
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:22.000
After you have cast your vote and when I declare the ballot closed, the two ballot boxes in the rear will be coming down to the front.

808
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
the front.

809
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:33.500
At that point, tellers for Representatives Packard and Simpson and also two appointed by the chair will come down.

810
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.500
Representative Packard has designated representatives Fred Doucette and Joe Sweeney.

811
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:44.000
Representative Simpson has designated representatives Mary Haken Phillips and Nicholas Germana.

812
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.500
So one will be at each box.

813
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500
The members will do the counting.

814
01:04:50.500 --> 01:05:01.000
And the chair appoints the youngest members from the prior session as chair tellers, and that is Representatives McDonnell and Wheeler.

815
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
If members need assistance in casting their ballots, please raise your hand.

816
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.500
I will come and retrieve the ballot for you and cast your ballot.

817
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500
Got you.

818
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.500
Got you.

819
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.500
Okay.

820
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.500
Okay.

821
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:27.000
So I will have the staff head to the boxes, please.

822
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Thank you.

823
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Okay.

824
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Okay.

825
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.500
So I will have the staff head to the boxes, please.

826
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.000
The staff will stand behind the boxes.

827
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
No ballots.

828
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Okay.

829
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.500
Well, ballots will be forthcoming.

830
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:51.500
Let's get some ballots to them.

831
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500
Thank you.

832
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Have all members received a ballot?

833
01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
Very good.

834
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.500
All right.

835
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:10.000
I am going to collect ballots for those folks that need them, so please just hold your hand up.

836
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.500
I will come and do that now.

837
01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.500
And then I will call up the divisions.

838
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500
Gracias.

839
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500
Thank you.

840
01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.500
Representative Jess Evans.

841
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.500
Gracias.

842
01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.500
Gracias.

843
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500
Gracias.

844
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:35.500
Have all those that needed assistance been able to cast a ballot?

845
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
You need a ballot?

846
01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.500
I hereby declare the ballot closed.

847
01:06:40.500 --> 01:07:01.000
At this time, see, this is the fun time, because I have to choose who goes and who doesn't, and some people get mad, and I still have to get elected by you, so I don't want to make any bad.

848
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.500
This time, please, as I mentioned, make note of the boxes and where they are.

849
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:14.000
This time I will call Division 3 to cast next one.

850
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.500
I'm going to take a look at the camera.

851
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:23.000
I'm going to take a look at the camera.

852
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.500
I'm going to take a look at the camera.

853
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:32.000
I'm going to take a look at the camera.

854
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.500
I'm going to take a look at the camera.

855
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:41.000
I'm going to take a look at the camera.

856
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.500

And J.B.

1038

Cullen is declared Sergeant-in-Arms for the House 2526 bionis.

1039
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Would the clerk come up, please?

1040
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Raise your right hand and where appropriate state your name in town.

1041
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000

So help me God.

So help me God.

Okay.

1048
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.000
Representative, no, that's it, yeah.

1049
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:57.500
This sort of, you know, I haven't done this in two years, so, you know, give me a break.

1050
01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:12.500
To the best of my abilities, agreeable to the rules and regulations of the New Hampshire Constitution, and the laws of the state of New Hampshire, so help me God.

1051
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.500
Well, that was a hell of a start.

1052
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.500
Okay.

1053
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.000
The joint convention will come to order.

1054
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Okay.

1055
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.500
Okay, see it wasn't really my fault this time.

1056
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.500
The house will come to order.

1057
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.500
Well now, no, that's, let's see.

1058
01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.000
Resolution to form joint convention.

1059
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Speaker, House will now attend to a resolution.

1060
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Clerk reads this resolution.

1061
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Mr.

1062
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Speaker, Representatives Smith and Simpson offer the following.

1063
01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:05.500
Resolve that the House inform the Honorable Senate it is organized and is ready to meet in a joint convention for the purpose of electing a Secretary of State and a State Treasurer.

1064
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.500
Are you ready for the question?

1065
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:11.500
All those in favor say aye.

1066
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.500
Aye.

1067

Those opposed nay, you guys have it, and the resolution is adopted.

1068
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.500
The House will tend to, okay.

1069
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.500
They're gonna bring the chairs first.

1070
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.500
All right, we got about a few minute break here.

1071
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:34.000
They gotta bring chairs for the senators.

1072
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Thank you.

1073
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000

1074

Thank you.

1077
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Okay, good.

1078
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Perfect.

1079
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Okay, go.

1080
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.500
No wait for the message.

1081
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.500
I think they're ready.

1082
01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.500
Thank you.

1083
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.500
Gracias.

1084
01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.500

1085
01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500

1086
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.500

1087
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.500

1088
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.500
Thank you.

1089
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.500

1090
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.500
Thank you.

1091
01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.500

1092
01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.500

1093
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.500
Thank you.

1094
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.500
Gracias.

1095
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.500
Thank you.

1096
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.500
Thank you.

1097
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.500
Thank you.

1098
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.500
I'm not the eight.

1099
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.500
Thank you.

1100
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:32.500
Vielen Dank.

1101
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.500
Thank you.

1102
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.500
Gracias.

1103
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.500
Thank you.

1104
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.500
Thank you.

1105
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.500
The House will come to order.

1106
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.000
Recognize the clerk for a Senate message.

1107
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Mr.

1108
01:22:49.000 --> 01:23:04.500
Speaker, the Senate has organized and is ready to meet with the House of Representatives in joint convention for the purpose of electing a Secretary of State and a State Treasurer.

1109
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.500
Recognize the Clerk.

1110
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.000
The Chair recognizes the Clerk.

1111
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Well, I thought we were ready.

1112
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Thank you.

1113
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.500
Well, I thought we were ready, but...

1114
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
Thank you.

1115
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.000
The chair recognizes the clerk.

1116
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Mr.

1117
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Speaker, the honorable Senate.

1118
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Thank you.

1119
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Joint convention will come.

1120
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Recognize the clerk?

1121
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Mr.

1122
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.500
Speaker, the President of the Senate constitutional officers of Secretary of State and State Treasurer.

1123
01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:46.500
Nominations for the Secretary of State are now in order.

1124
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:54.000
The chair recognizes Senator from Hampstead, Senator Birdsill, for the purpose of making a nomination.

1125
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Thank you, Mr.

1126
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.500
Speaker, and congratulations to you and the new House.

1127
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:08.000
I'd like to place in nomination the name of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1128
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:17.500
As a former chair of the Senate Election Law Committee, I've worked closely with Secretary Scanlon and his staff.

1129
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:24.500
Secretary Scanlon is a trusted, nonpartisan resource for the legislature and for our communities.

1130
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:30.000
His team is one of the best in the state government.

1131
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Their work results in elections that run smoothly, have some of the highest turnouts in the country, and have the public's trust.

1132
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:47.000
However, the Secretary of State's office does much more than just elections.

1133
01:24:47.000 --> 01:25:05.500
They have a whole host of responsibilities, include working in the areas of administration where it houses information on the governor and council, lobbyists, New Hampshire's Canadian Trade Council, the right to know ombudsman, and our ethics.

1134
01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:19.500
They have a corporate division which maintains the New Hampshire State Registry of Corporations and provides accessible, transparent services that support the growth of New Hampshire's business environment.

1135
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:24.500
The office also manages our Uniform Commercial Code Statutory Liens.

1136
01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:31.000
This department is a registry that serves the commercial lending and banking community.

1137
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:49.000
It manages security regulations through the Bureau of Securities and Regulations, and their mission is to create equitable regulations for the protection of New Hampshire investors, as well as facilitating responsible capital formations of this state.

1138
01:25:49.000 --> 01:26:07.500
The Secretary of State's Office also manages New Hampshire's archives and records, where they preserve documents of the history of the New Hampshire state government and help state agencies with their proper management of their historical documents.

1139
01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:18.000
The Secretary of State also manages all of our vital records, which keeps track of births and deaths throughout the state.

1140
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:26.000
As you can see, the Secretary of State's office does so much more than just elections.

1141
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And in order to manage these processes, we need someone with a steady hand, deep experience, and who is trusted to work in a nonpartisan manner.

1142
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:52.500
And lastly, because if you've ever been in their office during the summer, Secretary Scanlon was someone who was able to put air conditioning in that office.

1143
01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:57.000
He has all of these characteristics and much more.

1144
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.500
David Scanlon is the right person for the job.

1145
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:10.500
I wholeheartedly support him for Secretary of State and hope you will join me in supporting him today.

1146
01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500
Thank you.

1147
01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:15.000
Senator Berzio nominates David M.

1148
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.500
Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1149
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:22.500
Presidents Leachman and McDonald second the nomination of David M.

1150
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.000
Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1151
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Are there further nominations?

1152
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:35.500
There being none, Senator Bursil moves that the nominations be closed, one ballot cast for David M.

1153
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:42.500
Scanlon, and declare him the duly elected Secretary of State for the 2025-2026 biennium.

1154
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500
Are you ready for the question?

1155
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.500
All those in favor say aye.

1156
01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.500
Aye.

1157
01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.500
I suppose nay.

1158
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.500
The ayes have it.

1159
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.500
And David M.

1160
01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:02.000
Scanlon is declared the Secretary of State for the 2025-2026 biennium.

1161
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
.

1162
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Congratulations to you.

1163
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
.

1164
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.500
Well, thank all of you for this great honor.

1165
01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500
It's a big job.

1166
01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:23.000
As Senator Birdsell said, it is a state agency that the Secretary of State has to run.

1167
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I appreciate her nomination and the seconds of Representative Leishman and McDonald.

1168
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:46.500
You know, the secretary is only as good as the people that work for him and the staff, so I have to give a big thank you to my deputies, Erin Hennessey and Patty Lovejoy.

1169
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:53.000
They're fantastic, and I hope you have the opportunity to work with them.

1170
01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.500
And then I can't say enough about the staff in the department, in all of the divisions.

1171
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:11.000
We have employees that really step up, and hopefully you get to work with them on a day-to-day basis.

1172
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
They do tremendous work, and I'm really, really proud of each and every one of them.

1173
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:26.500
In terms of accomplishments over the last two years, the department has been very busy.

1174
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:41.500
We've had a lot of successes, but the largest one is the preserving the first in the nation presidential primary, which is something that everybody in this room gets behind.

1175
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:47.500
We face the largest challenge to that primary in the primary's history.

1176
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:57.000
And I think the aftermath of that is that it is still as relevant as it ever has been.

1177
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And I look forward to when we do it again in 2028.

1178
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Thank you.

1179
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Thank you, Mr.

1180
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Speaker, Madam President.

1181
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I rise to nominate Monica Mazzopelli to again be treasurer of the state of New Hampshire.

1182
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
This is a critical role for the financial management of our state.

1183
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:31.000
She brings a background of financial management in New Hampshire government for the last 24 years.

1184
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.500
As treasurer, she is a member on several boards and authorities.

1185
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:42.500
I serve with her on the College Tuition Savings Plan Advisory Commission.

1186
01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:51.000
She serves on the Retirement Board, Municipal Bond Bank Board, Deferred Compensation Plan Commission, and several others.

1187
01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:01.500
She's a key advisor to both the House and Senate Ways and Means Committee and the House and Senate Finance Committees.

1188
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:13.500
She's brought us record returns on the investment of state funds and has brought us two credit rating upgrades in the last two years.

1189
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:17.500
That's important in achieving low rates for borrowing.

1190
01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:41.500
She's responsible for issuing all the state government checks, both for payroll and services, and she carefully deals with the banks that are near where our employees live so that they can cash their checks in a neighborhood where they live and not have to pay a charge.

1191
01:31:41.500 --> 01:32:03.500
I could go on and on describing all the roles that Treasurer Mezapelli plays, but I can assure you from my 30 years of doing budgets, she can keep all the various functions of our financial system in her mind without missing any detail.

1192
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:10.000
If you want a good read, pick up the New Hampshire bond statement.

1193
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000
This is about 100 pages describing the economic and demographic details of our state.

1194
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:23.500
She publishes it annually for the negotiations and issuance of New Hampshire bonds.

1195
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:34.000
Please join with me in voting for Monica Mezopelli for New Hampshire State Treasurer and keep our finances in good hands.

1196
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Thank you.

1197
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Representative Ken Weil nominates Monica Mezzipelli for the State Treasurer.

1198
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:49.500
The chair recognizes the Senator from Nashville, Senator Cindy Rosenwald, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1199
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:51.500
Thank you, Mr.

1200
01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.000
Speaker, and congratulations to you.

1201
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.500
And it's great to be back in this chamber.

1202
01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:05.500
I, too, am pleased to support the nomination of Monica Mezzipelli for state treasurer.

1203
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:15.500
She has held this position for nearly five years, and for six years before that she was the deputy treasurer.

1204
01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:28.000
I echo much of what Representative Weiler said about her, but the role of treasurer is critically important to the health of New Hampshire's economy.

1205
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:40.000
First, she's focused on the state's borrowing capacity, recommending to the legislature the amount that is appropriate for us to bond every two years.

1206
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Her sound professional judgment on borrowing has led to two upgrades in ratings, which will save the state millions in borrowing costs.

1207
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:58.500
She's also responsible for investing and managing the state's cash reserves of over $2.5 billion.

1208
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:14.000
She's been incredibly successful here with interest coming in $85 million ahead of plan for the last fiscal year and $46 million ahead of plan for the current year to date.

1209
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.500
This is by far our best performing revenue source right now.

1210
01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:29.000
Further, as state treasurer, she's also responsible for oversight of municipal cash reserves through the public deposit investment pool.

1211
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.500
This is worth over 600 million dollars right now.

1212
01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:40.500
Helps our cities and towns invest their own money to get the best returns.

1213
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:50.000
And she oversees New Hampshire's college savings plan which many families depend on to send their children to college.

1214
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:57.500
She's responsive to all legislators, not just those serving on finance and ways and means.

1215
01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:05.000
She's done a great job for the state, and I hope we will re-elect her.

1216
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Thank you, Mr.

1217
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Speaker.

1218
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Senator Rosenwald seconds the nomination of Monica Mesapelli for the state treasurer.

1219
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Are there further nominations?

1220
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.500
There being none, President Weiler moves that the nominations be closed.

1221
01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:31.500
One ballot cast for Monica Mesapelli and declare her the duly elected state treasurer for the 2025-2026 biennium.

1222
01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.500
Are you ready for the question?

1223
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.500
All those in favor say aye.

1224
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.500
Aye.

1225
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.500
I suppose nay.

1226
01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.500
The ayes have it.

1227
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:47.000
And Monica Mesapelli is declared State Treasurer.

1228
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.500
I'd like to thank Representative Wilder and Senator Rosenwald for nominating me today.

1229
01:35:53.500 --> 01:36:02.000
It is a great honor to have their support and to hear the kind words and remarks.

1230
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:16.500
It is also a great honor to be here before all of you today, to be in this chamber, and to receive the overwhelming support you provided me today.

1231
01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:27.500
I really thank you for electing me today and for giving me the opportunity to do this again for two more years.

1232
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:33.500
The last four years have been the highlight of my professional life.

1233
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:45.000
The challenges that we face during the pandemic and the benefits that we have received during the recovery have taught us many lessons.

1234
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I have certainly learned a lot.

1235
01:36:48.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And one of the key takeaways for me is the importance of being prepared, the need to assess risks and develop policies and plans that can guide us during good and also not so good times.

1236
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I'm really excited to continue this work and to continue building not only a more resilient treasury but to continue building a stronger state, a stronger economy and all for the benefit of all granted staters.

1237
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But clearly that's not a one job, so I look forward to collaborating with all of you to continue making this state the best state in the country.

1238
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:53.500
And I want to be brief today, so before you go back to your business and your lunch, I would just like to take the opportunity to recognize the Treasury staff.

1239
01:37:53.500 --> 01:38:03.000
They are a wonderful, hardworking group of people who really care about their job and the citizens we serve.

1240
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
I feel very honored I get to work with them every day.

1241
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:17.500
And in closing, I just would like to remind you that my office is across the street.

1242
01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:22.000
I am only one email or phone call away.

1243
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.500
Please do not hesitate to contact me.

1244
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:31.000
I would love to assist you in any way I can.

1245
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:44.500
And with that, I thank you again for your support today and for your trust, and I look forward to working together in this upcoming legislative session.

1246
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:47.000
And congratulations to you all.

1247
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Thank you.

1248
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.500
The joint convention will come to order.

1249
01:38:52.500 --> 01:39:01.000
I will now administer the oath of office to the Secretary of State and the State Treasurer.

1250
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Raise your right hand and where appropriate, state your name and town.

1251
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:22.500
I, of, you solemnly swear, that I will bear faith and true allegiance to the United States of America, and the state of New Hampshire, and will support the constitutions thereof.

1252
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.500
And will support the constitution thereof.

1253
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.500
So help me God.

1254
01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.500
So help me God.

1255
01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500
I.

1256
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.500
I.

1257
01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500
Do solemnly swear.

1258
01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.500
Solemnly swear.

1259
01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:41.000
And sincerely affirm that I will faithfully.

1260
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.500
And sincerely affirm that I will faithfully.

1261
01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:46.500
And impartially discharge.

1262
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.500
And impartially discharge.

1263
01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:52.500
and perform all the duties incumbent on me.

1264
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.500
Incumbent on me.

1265
01:39:54.500 --> 01:40:09.000
I according to the best of my abilities, agreeable to the rules, and regulations of the Constitution, and laws of the state of New Hampshire, so help me God.

1266
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So help me God.

1267
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Congratulations.

1268
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Thank you very much.

1269
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:25.000
The Senator from Hampstead, Senator Birdshill, and the member from Charlestown, Representative Stephen Smith, move that the joint convention arise.

1270
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Are you ready for the question?

1271
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
All those in favor say aye.

1272
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Aye.

1273
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.500
Those opposed nay, the ayes have it.

1274
01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:39.000
The joint convention is adjourned.

1275
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
The House is still in session.

1276
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Thank you.

1277
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
The House will come to order.

1278
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.500
The House will attend to a resolution.

1279
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.500
Mr.

1280
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:57.000
Speaker, Representative Stephen Smith and Simpson offer the following.

1281
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:04.500
Resolve that the House adopt the rules of the 2024 session for the 2025-26 biennium.

1282
01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:12.500
Representative Stephen Smith orders a floor amendment to House Resolution 1, located in your seat pockets.

1283
01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:15.500
The Chair recognizes Representative Stephen Smith.

1284
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:21.500
This amendment contains a change to the standing committees of the House.

1285
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.500
There's two changes.

1286
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:27.500
One new standing committee on housing is created.

1287
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.500
I think both sides want this.

1288
01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:35.000
I know the public wants us to do it.

1289
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I attended a housing symposium years ago that was a bipartisan affair.

1290
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.500
Then Governor Hassan was there.

1291
01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:57.000
And one of the outputs of that meeting was where they broke out in the work sessions that they wanted the House to have a housing committee.

1292
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.000
So it's time we showed the public that we focus on it.

1293
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000
The other change is a splitting of the education committee.

1294
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.500
Right now, rough count is about 120 bills headed to education.

1295
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:28.500
If you would like to serve on education and be involved in that, but also do not want to live here four days a week, vote for this rules change.

1296
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:37.000
One committee will focus primarily on funding, and the other one will focus on policy and administration.

1297
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:57.500
There is also a hope that by separating those two issues, the policy and administration can be far more contentious than the funding that maybe will actually beat the courts to getting to a solution and save face for the House.

1298
01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:10.000
So, to serve more of you better, a lot of you asked to be on education, you don't get it because there's only 20 slots.

1299
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000
This will create more opportunity to serve on that committee.

1300
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:24.000
So hopefully you will agree that this will serve you better, lighten your workload, and serve the public.

1301
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Thank you, Mr.

1302
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Speaker.

1303
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:35.000
The question is on the adoption of the floor amendment to House Resolution No.

1304
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
1.

1305
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Are you ready for the question?

1306
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
All those in favor say aye.

1307
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Aye.

1308
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Those opposed nay.

1309
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.500
The ayes have it, and the amendment is adopted.

1310
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:56.500
The question now is on the adoption of the resolution.

1311
01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:59.500
Are you ready for the question?

1312
01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:02.500
All those in favor say aye.

1313
01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.500
Aye.

1314
01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.500
Those opposed nay.

1315
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:11.000
The ayes have it, and the resolution is adopted.

1316
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
The House will attend to a further resolution.

1317
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Mr.

1318
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Speaker, Representatives Stephen Smith and Simpson offer the fall and resolve that all action taken at all sessions of the House of Representatives be recorded through the public address system and that the recording be used by the clerk to confirm and correct the permanent journal.

1319
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:52.000
The permanent journal as prepared by the clerk and as may be corrected by the House, shall be the official record of the House.

1320
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.500
The question is on the adoption of the resolution.

1321
01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:59.500
Are you ready for the question?

1322
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:02.500
All those in favor say aye.

1323
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.500
Those oppose nay.

1324
01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:06.500
The ayes have it.

1325
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.500
The resolution is adopted.

1326
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:12.500
The House will attend to a further resolution.

1327
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.500
Mr.

1328
01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:19.000
Speaker, Representative Stephen Smith and Simpson offer the following.

1329
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:32.500
Resolved that the following policy be established for the distribution of House calendars and journals, bills and resolutions to members of the General Court and State Departments.

1331
01:45:50.500 --> 01:46:00.500
Two, persons requesting copies for the entire session will be charged a fee sufficient to cover postage, envelopes, and handling.

1332
01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:07.500
Such fees may be prorated when services received for portions of the session only.

1333
01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.500
All fees are payable in advance.

1334
01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:20.000
The subscriber list may be submitted for legislative accounting and auditing purpose, but is not for publication or sale.

01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.500

As opposed, nay.

1357
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:27.000
The ayes have it and the resolution is adopted.

1358
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:36.000
The House will now attend to an amendment to the ethics guidelines as printed in the House calendar.

1359
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.500
For what reason does the member rise?

1360
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:41.500
To make a motion.

1361
01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.500
Stage a motion.

1362
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:53.000
I move to special order the ethics amendment to the next House session as regular place in the calendar.

1363
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.500
The motion is in order.

1364
01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:32.500
I have heard from many people that there is significant changes in this, and due to all the other business that we have had today, I have not yet had the time to thoroughly analyze them, and therefore would ask that we special order it to our next session, the first session in January, so that we can have the time to study it and speak to it as of appropriate after that study.

1365
01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.500
Thank you.

1366
01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.500
Jared.

1367
01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:38.500
Thank you.

1368
01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:40.500
Chairman.

1369
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.500
Thank you, Mr.

1370
01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.500
Speaker.

1371
01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.500
I rise to second the motion.

1372
01:49:47.500 --> 01:50:08.500
And if I may, I would like to echo all of those sentiments, and I think we've all seen recently that how important ethics rules are, how they really will govern our activities to a significant degree over the next two years.

1373
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:18.500
We've seen that not only are they important, but if they're not just right, they can be done wrong with.

1374
01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:29.500
So we want to take a little extra time, if you would agree, we need three-fifths vote for this, to achieve that.

1375
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.500
Please vote yes.

1376
01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:33.500
Thank you.

1377
01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:41.000
The motion before us is to special order the ethics guideline amendment to January 8th.

1378
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Chair recognizes Representative Lynn.

1379
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Colleagues, I guess I'm not sure candidly that I oppose this, but I want to raise several issues that I think we need to think about.

1380
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:10.000
First of all, until just now, there was no issue raised, at least with me and I believe with other members of of the committee about this issue.

1381
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
With one exception.

1382
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
The member will suspend.

1383
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Yeah, I'm not sure who yelled out like that, but that is completely inappropriate.

1384
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
The member may continue.

1385
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Thank you, Mr.

1386
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Speaker.

1387
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.500
With one exception, I had a call about a week ago from a freshman representative.

1388
01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.500
I have to apologize.

1389
01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:40.000
I frankly don't remember his name now.

1390
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:48.500
But we had a long discussion about his concern about a particular section of the ethics guidelines.

1391
01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:51.000
We had a long discussion.

1392
01:51:51.000 --> 01:52:09.500
I told him that my view was he raised a concern about whether if somebody was an advocate for an organization, but not an advocate before the legislature, would that require the person to recuse from participating?

1393
01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:30.000
And basically what I said to the person is, first of all, I can't speak for the Ethics Committee, but just speaking sort of as a general of what my thoughts were on it, that it would depend on the circumstances.

1394
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:51.500
That was the only issue that was raised, and more importantly, the objection that this member raised, although he said I raise it to the guidelines, the problem is that the guidelines section in question mirrors the statute that we passed last year.

1395
01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:54.000
So it's in the law.

1396
01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:59.500
We can't change that unless we want to change the law.

1397
01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:04.500
The practical considerations I have with postponing this are this.

1398
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:15.000
As I understand it from the clerk, and he can speak to this much more eloquently than I can, I'm sure.

1399
01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:24.000
If we don't act on this now, this means we have to act on it on January 8th.

1400
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:30.500
And the problem with that, I think there are several problems with that.

1401
01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:46.500
We're not going to be here again until January 8th, and so that would mean that the Ethics Committee would have to meet and propose some language between now and January 8th.

1402
01:53:46.500 --> 01:54:08.000
For me, that's not a problem, but I can't speak for the Ethics Committee, and there are people on the Ethics Committee—first of all, this is December, it's the holiday season—there are people on the Ethics Committee who are, for example, former legislators.

1403
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:19.500
I don't know their availability, but more importantly for this body, the thing I see as a problem is, what's going to happen?

1404
01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:25.000
Let's suppose that some changes were proposed to the ethics guidelines.

1405
01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:35.500
That means you're going to get them on January 8th and then be expected to vote on them on January 8th?

1406
01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:40.000
I just don't see the sense in doing this.

1407
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:50.500
I will tell you that the Ethics Committee voted unanimously to adopt the guidelines which track the language in the statute.

1408
01:54:50.500 --> 01:55:03.000
So I'm not quite sure what we're going to change that we would have the power to change unless we were going to change legislation.

1409
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Now, one other thing that I should mention, there is language in the guidelines dealing with the sexual harassment policy.

1410
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:26.500
If you look at that language, you will see that in addition to sort of prescribing sexual harassment, it has broader language that deals generally with harassment.

1411
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:37.500
The point I would make there is that that is something that has been in the ethics guidelines for a long time.

1412
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:45.000
Apparently, it was adopted by the Facilities Commission, the committee, if I recall correctly, Mr.

1413
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Speaker.

1414
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
This was long before my time.

1415
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:55.500
But anyway, it's been in the guidelines for a long time.

1416
01:55:55.500 --> 01:56:05.000
So in terms of the substance, even as to that, we didn't change anything with regard to the substance.

1417
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000
So I guess what I, the bottom line is this.

1418
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:21.500
if this body thinks that we should put it off till January 8th, I guess fine we'll put it off to January 8th.

1419
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:30.000
I'm not sure what we're going to accomplish by that given, you know, given what's already happened.

1420
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
So thank you Mr.

1421
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Speaker.

1422
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Does the member yield to questions?

1423
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I do.

1424
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.500
Member yields Representative Splane Thank you, Mr.

1425
01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.500
Speaker.

1426
01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:49.000
Thank you to the member for taking my question.

1427
01:56:49.000 --> 01:57:11.500
It's my understanding, based on the timetable, that we still have the ability to make changes to the rules on January 8th with amendments and or beyond that with just a majority vote until the end of December if we were to do so again.

1428
01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:21.500
However, the 8th is the only scheduled time we'll be meeting, so it seems to be the only practical time.

1429
01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:36.000
My question is, if we were to pass this today, could members not bring amendments on the 8th and then put those amendments to the body on the 8th.

1430
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000
So, again, I'm taking my cue from the clerk here.

1431
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Members cannot make amendments to the ethics rules.

1432
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.500
It would have to come from the ethics committee.

1433
01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:55.000
Again, in some sense, this is sort of a process issue.

1434
01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:05.500
If there had been some issues raised earlier that the ethics committee could have dealt with, we would have addressed them.

1435
01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:15.000
But, I mean, assuming we could, and again, as I say, these ethics guidelines are taken from the statute.

1436
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:35.500
So, you know, we did make, we all voted on, both this body and the other body, voted on significant changes to the ethics rules, which the ethics rules will now require recusal in certain cases as covered by the rules.

1437
01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.500
That's a big change.

1438
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.000
There's no question about it.

1439
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
But we passed that.

1440
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And, you know, we can't sort of adopt ethics rules that say, well, you know, you don't have to follow what's in the statute.

1441
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
We can't do that.

1442
01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:07.000
So, again, I say, if you and your wisdom think we should wait until January 8th, I guess we can do that.

1443
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:18.500
I'm really concerned about the fact that we're, on January 8th, we're going to be in no better position than we are today.

1444
01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:22.500
Does the member yield to a follow-up question?

1445
01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.500
I do.

1446
01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.500
Governor McLean.

1447
01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.500
Thank you again, Mr.

1448
01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:30.500
Speaker.

1449
01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:35.500
Thank you again to the member for taking my question.

1450
01:59:35.500 --> 02:00:00.500
So if I understand correctly, the members themselves cannot propose the amendments, but if we pass this today, there's nothing that stops the ethics committee from proposing another revision on the 8th if members come to the Ethics Committee and the Ethics Committee passes it between now and the 8th.

1451
02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:02.500
Is that correct?

1452
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:05.500
Yes, I believe that is correct.

1453
02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:09.000
Does the member yield a further question?

1454
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I do.

1455
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.500
Representative Smith, you may require.

1456
02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:15.500
Thank you, Mr.

1457
02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:17.500
Chair.

1458
02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.500
You had no choice, did you?

1459
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.500
I'm really confused.

1460
02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:33.000
The gentleman who proposed this motion indicated that he had just gotten this and he hadn't had time to review it.

1461
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:55.500
If I remember correctly, and I might be wrong, the calendar came out earlier than usual last week because of the holiday and therefore every member of the house had access to this either Tuesday or Wednesday of last week, which was a week ago.

1462
02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:07.000
And therefore, I know I had 25 for Thanksgiving dinner and I'm still doing the laundry, but I had time to read it.

1463
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:14.500
And I would assume if you thought it was important, you would have read it.

1464
02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:21.000
I don't really think that it's legitimate to say that we were blindsided.

1465
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
We weren't.

1466
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
We've had it.

1467
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
We've had it for a week.

1468
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And I would think we ought to get on with our business.

1469
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Oh, you're absolutely right.

1470
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
I forgot that.

1471
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:43.500
My question is, am I wrong in when we were notified?

1472
02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:50.500
And I'd like to thank my colleague for putting me on the right track.

1473
02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:53.500
That is an excellent question, Representative.

1474
02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:56.500
I think you are not wrong.

1475
02:01:56.500 --> 02:02:20.000
The only other thing that I would say is, please understand that the Ethics Committee did go through these guidelines really sort of line by line, and there were a number of, you know, changes to the guidelines we made to make them consistent with the statute.

1476
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:35.500
So I guess what I want to say to you is the Ethics Committee, you know, this wasn't, we didn't just sort of get this and say, okay, let's just vote.

1477
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:39.000
And we spent some time on this.

1478
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I'm sorry.

1479
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000
We spent some time on this.

1480
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:51.000
And that's not to say that, you know, that it couldn't be made better.

1481
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:57.500
I'm not going to say that, you know, sit here and say that.

1482
02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:20.000
But what I am saying is for the reasons I've stated before, I'm not really sure how we would advance the ball by delaying this, particularly to the extent that people have, are basically saying change the guidelines to make them inconsistent with the statute.

1483
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.500
We just can't, we can't do that.

1484
02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:28.500
The Ethics Committee doesn't have any authority to do that.

1485
02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:34.000
We would have to have a new bill to do that.

1486
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Thank you.

1487
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.500
Do you recognize Representative Perez?

1488
02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:40.500
Thank you.

1489
02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:42.500
Thank you.

1490
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:46.500
I think the point has been missed here.

1491
02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:56.500
I think the reason why people want to delay this is so that they have an opportunity to read it.

1492
02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:07.500
I understand that it came out a week ago, a little ahead of time, but people had family, they had the holiday.

1493
02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:13.500
Not everybody had the opportunity to sit down, read, and absorb this.

1494
02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:40.500
So I don't understand why not a lot putting it off for a vote instead of worrying about you know this amendment and that and this and that maybe nobody heard about it because they didn't have heard questions or put questions out about it is because they didn't have time to read it.

1495
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.500
Thank you.

1496
02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:47.000
Chair, can I, Chair, can I represent you McFarland?

1497
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.500
For what reason do you?

1498
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.500
Thank you, Mr.

1499
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.500
Speaker.

1500
02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:56.500
I rise for a parliamentary inquiry.

1501
02:04:56.500 --> 02:04:58.500
State your inquiry.

1502
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:27.000
I would like to ask the clerk further to the questions that were posed to Representative Lynn and further to the understanding that Representative Lynn provided us that an amendment could be provided to us additionally to the existing amendment on January 8th so that we would have a further amendment from the Ethics Committee before us.

1503
02:05:27.000 --> 02:06:13.000
My question of the Clerk is does he concur with that understanding and does he believe that if there is a significant number of representatives who may appear before the Rules Committee and before the Ethics Committee between now and January the 8th with the expectation that the Rules Committee and the Ethics Committee can discuss presenting a further amendment that would not be in contravention of the statutes enacted by HB 1388, but would further clarify them and would provide additional guidance within the guidelines that we are seeking to amend.

1504
02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Would those actions be in order, and would it then be in order for us to vote for this motion to special order the current amendment?

1505
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:34.500
Well, he won't give us an opinion on voting, but he'll try and answer your other question.

1506
02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:36.500
Thank you, sir.

1507
02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:38.500
Chair, recognize the clerk.

1508
02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.500
Thank you, Mr.

1509
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.500
Speaker.

1510
02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:47.500
Just for clarity, the clerk doesn't usually answer parliamentary inquiries.

1511
02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:49.500
The chair does that.

1512
02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:59.000
That being said, there are some specific questions that you asked relative to House rules versus the ethics guidelines.

1513
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.500
House rules are separate from the Ethics Committee process.

1514
02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:22.500
The Ethics Committee is bound by statute to present their guidelines to the House, and the House, and the House has three House days, meaning three House session days, in which to adopt or vote down those guidelines.

1515
02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:27.500
Additionally, the Senate likewise has to do the same thing.

1516
02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:32.000
The issue here is that today is day one.

1517
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.500
The eighth is day two.

1518
02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:42.500
Day three, technically, would be the ninth, which is essentially exclusively reserved for the governor's inaugural.

1519
02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:58.000
We pro forma come into session on the ninth, but it is really not, and has not been in my lifetime a voting day where we take up additional legislative activity.

1520
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:05.000
In order to special order this measure to the 8th, it would take three-fifths.

1521
02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.500
That is pursuant to our House rules.

1522
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:16.000
In terms of amendments coming from the Ethics Committee, the Ethics Committee must be reformed.

1523
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:22.000
A new Ethics Committee has to be established by the new administration.

1524
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:36.000
That consists of two members of the House, a member of the majority and the minority, two members of the Senate, a member of the majority and minority.

1525
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:48.000
The Speaker appoints a member of the public, the Senate President appoints a member of the public, and then they jointly choose a chair.

1526
02:08:48.000 --> 02:09:34.000
That is on the list for appointments that need to happen, much like the Administrative Rules Committee and our House Rules Committee that hopefully will be appointed within the month, but the likelihood of that happening and our noticing for calendar to have not only a meeting scheduled but an appointment and also new guidelines adopted by said committee because the committee process is that they take those guidelines that they are presented, they discuss them, they have time to digest, and then they put them forward to the two respective bodies.

1527
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:47.000
So the short answer is yes, these can be amended today, these can be amended the 8th, and subsequent amendments from the Ethics Committee can come.

1528
02:09:47.000 --> 02:10:05.500
The reason they cannot be amended, these can be amended by members of the House, is that this is essentially a report of a body that has to be adopted, similar to a Committee of Conference report.

1529
02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:09.500
It is either an upvote or a downvote.

1530
02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:15.000
And then they have to go back to the drawing board.

1531
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Does that answer your question, sir?

1532
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
It does.

1533
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Thank you.

1534
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:41.000
And if I may ask one final question to the Chair, am I correct in understanding that if this were a motion to table rather than a motion to special order, that it would be a simple majority?

1535
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Yes, correct.

1536
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Thank you.

1537
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Representative Weber.

1538
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.500
Thank you, and thank you for taking my question.

1539
02:10:51.500 --> 02:11:32.000
My question is simply, if any member has any question about their obligations under these ethics guidelines if we are to adopt them, do they not have the opportunity to present that question to the ethics committee with all of their own specific circumstances so that the ethics committee may give that member a ruling on the guidelines and also that that ruling then stands as guidelines for other members so the guidelines could be fleshed out as time goes on.

1540
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
That's correct.

1541
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Yes.

1542
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
What purpose does a member rise?

1543
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Ask a question, Mr.

1544
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Speaker.

1545
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Ask away.

1546
02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
So my question, Mr.

1547
02:11:47.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Speaker, is for us freshman representatives who got our packets yesterday and have not had access to email and have not had access to review this policy and understand it thoroughly, who were briefed on the existing policy before these changes during orientation, are we expected to vote in favor?

1548
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:18.500
Are we to vote for changing policy that we haven't read today, Mr.

1549
02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:20.500
Speaker?

1550
02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:24.500
How you vote is totally up to you.

1551
02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:26.500
Representative Roy.

1552
02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:29.500
What purpose does a member rise?

1553
02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:33.000
To ask a question of the committee.

1554
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Go ahead.

1555
02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.500
The question is regarding the definition of compensation and the definition of entity.

1556
02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:47.500
Many of us in here belong to a variety of nonprofit organizations.

1557
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:51.000
Some of us hold positions in that.

1558
02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.500
Representative, the motion before us is to special order.

1559
02:12:55.500 --> 02:13:05.000
Yeah, and this goes to that question because if the definition isn't recognized, it will change some people's votes.

1560
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Therefore, that particular entity, the definition of compensation, I think, is essential to determining whether or not a vote should be taken, one way or another.

1561
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
May I continue?

1562
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I'm not going to get into answering questions.

1563
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
No.

1564
02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:48.000
So the question is, if we vote to continue it, would that give the Ethics Committee a chance to further define what compensation is and whether or not compensation includes payment of incidentals and costs of those persons who provide services to a nonprofit.

1565
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:54.000
That would be up to the ethics committee to make that determination.

1566
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.500
I'm not going to sit here and try to find it.

1567
02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:01.500
Very good, sir.

1568
02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.500
Thank you.

1569
02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:05.500
Wait a minute.

1570
02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:07.500
Okay.

1571
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:09.500
Senator Verville.

1572
02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:11.500
Thank you, Mr.

1573
02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:13.500
Speaker, and congratulations.

1574
02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:16.000
Just a quick parliamentary question.

1575
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:23.500
as a friendly reminder to myself, my colleagues, and maybe to inform the freshman members.

1576
02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:32.000
Is it not a breach of etiquette to call another member by their name from the well?

1577
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Is that correct?

1578
02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
That is not recommended.

1579
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Thank you, Mr.

1580
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Speaker.

1581
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.500
For what reason does the member rise?

1582
02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:48.500
I would like to make a motion to table this.

1583
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:59.000
A motion to table is a higher motion so the motion before is to table the amendment for the ethics guidelines.

1584
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Are you ready for the question?

1585
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Well, the only way a division can happen is if it's a standing division.

1586
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:18.000
You can't use the machines because it's not your assigned seat that will be going into the session.

1587
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
So the motion has been withdrawn.

1588
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000
So the motion is to table.

1589
02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Are you ready for the question?

1590
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
All those in favor say aye.

1591
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Chair is in doubt.

1592
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Chair is in doubt.

1593
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Chair is in doubt.

1594
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
We'll have a standing.

1595
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
All right.

1596
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Everybody must stay in their seats.

1597
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Paul, you have four, you have three, and I have two more.

1598
02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:53.000
The staff, everybody that said aye will stand.

1599
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
We sit, Representative.

1600
02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Until you're counted and told to sit down.

1601
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
All those voting yes.

1602
02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.500
All those voting aye, stand.

1603
02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.500
Thank you.

1604
02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:09.500
until you're counted and told to sit down.

1605
02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:12.000
All those voting aye, stand.

1606
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.500
The question is on the tabling motion.

1607
02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.500
Thank you.

1608
02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:19.500
Did you count?

1609
02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:21.500
Yeah, so.

1610
02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:23.500
Division, you can sit.

1611
02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:25.500
You can sit.

1612
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.500
You can sit.

1613
02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:31.500
All right, so 45 for those three divisions.

1614
02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:36.000
So Division 5 is 3, 5 is all sports.

1615
02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.500
All the nays, please rise and stay standing until you're counted.

1616
02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:43.500
Gracias.

1617
02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:45.500
Thank you.

1618
02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:47.500
Gracias.

1619
02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:49.500
Thank you.

1620
02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:51.500
Thank you.

1621
02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:53.500
We're all set.

1622
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:56.000
We had 242 voting nay.

1623
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.500
We had 106 voting nay.

1624
02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.500
The motion fails.

1625
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.500
We're back to the question of special order.

1626
02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:07.000
This is a three-fifth vote.

1627
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I guess, are you ready for the question?

1628
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Okay.

1629
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Thank you.

1630
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Seeing that this has to be a three-fifths motion, if I pass by three-fifths, there, there's no way I think I can, or any one of us in this chamber can honestly determine whether it's three-fifths or not.

1631
02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
So we're going to go to a standing.

1632
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
You withdraw.

1633
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Okay.

1634
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Withdrawing the motions.

1635
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Okay.

1636
02:17:46.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Okay, the question is now on the adoption of the ethics guidelines are you ready for the question all those in favor say aye those opposed nay when the amendment is adopted.

1637
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:09.500
The chair recognizes the member from Charlestown, Representative Stephen Smith for the third reading motion.

1638

1640
02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Yeah?

1641
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Okay.

1642
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.000
How about Wednesday, January 8th, 2025 at any particular time?

1643

How about Wednesday, January 8th, 2025 at any particular time?

1647

The question is on the third reading motion.

1648
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Are you ready for the question?

1649
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
All those in favor say aye.

The ayes have it.

1652
02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
The motion is adopted.

1653
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
The House will attend to announcements.

1654

There will be an organization meeting of Rockingham County delegates.

A couple of quick announcements for you.

1712
02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:14.500
One, for all new members, if you did not check your mailboxes right behind the chamber before session, you will find some goodies in your boxes.

1713
02:24:14.500 --> 02:24:19.500
You will have your name tags and some other stuff.

1714
02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:28.000
All members are invited after the session to get your new security pin in the ante room.

1715
02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.500
Tracy is back there with a checklist.

1716
02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:38.500
For those of you who want more than one, I know who you are.

1717
02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:41.500
You get one unless it breaks.

1718
02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:45.500
So please sign in and get your pin.

1719
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:47.500
Next, your portal forms.

02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:53.000
If you have not done your portal forms, please do them.

1721
02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:03.000
If you need help with your portal forms, please stop in GCAO, the administrative office downstairs on the first floor.

1722
02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.500
It is important that we get your committee choices.

1723
02:25:07.500 --> 02:25:16.500
Right now I've only received about 260 out of 399, so I need to hear from you, please.

1724
02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:22.000
Lastly, you all need to sign the computer use policy form.

1725
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:28.500
Folks from GCTS, General Corps Technology Services, are also in the ante room.

1726
02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:41.000
If you want your legislative email, if you would like to have a presence on the website, you need to sign the computer use policy.

1727
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
So please do that.

1728
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Thank you.

1729
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.500
The organizational session of 2025-2026.

1730
02:25:47.500 --> 02:25:52.000
We do for delaying everyone's lunch a bit more.

1731
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Is this all right?

1732
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Awesome.

1733
02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I apologize for delaying everyone's lunch a little bit more, but I rise today to commemorate a program that is near and dear to my heart.

1734
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:31.000
As the youngest member of this esteemed body, I recognize that I would not be standing before you in this chamber if it weren't for a robust civics education that gave me the knowledge and confidence to throw my hat into the political ring.

1735
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.500
Unfortunately, that was not wholly provided to me in public school.

1736
02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:40.000
I had to search elsewhere for it.

1737
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:50.500
To compensate for and to broaden my experience, I joined the legislative youth advisory Council in 2021, appointed by you, Mr.

1738
02:26:50.500 --> 02:27:01.000
Speaker, which opened my world to so many more political and civic opportunities that I had previously not been aware of.

1739
02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:08.000
One of these programs was the United States Senate Youth Program, established by U.S.

1740
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:27.500
Senate Resolution 324 in 1962, stating that, quote, the continued vitality of our republic depends in part on the intelligent understanding of our political processes and the functions of our national government by the citizens of the United States.

1741
02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:52.500
Every year, every state, as well as the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity, selects two high school juniors or seniors to represent them during a week-long trip to D.C., meeting with senators, cabinet officials, Supreme Court justices, and often the President of the United States.

1742
02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:58.000
In addition to this, every delegate receives a $10,000 undergraduate scholarship.

1743
02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Exactly a year ago Sunday, Mr.

1744
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Speaker, I was selected to represent our great state of New Hampshire in the 62nd annual program during March of this year, alongside my friend Mr.

1745
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Michael Blair of Manchester.

1746
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:34.000
During this program, we got to meet 102 other incredible delegates from across the country, as well as seeing everything from the Pentagon to the White House on the night of the State of the Union.

1747
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:49.000
After I returned home from D.C., I received an unexpected letter from a former member of this House, the Honorable Stephen Dupree, congratulating me on my selection for the program.

1748
02:28:49.000 --> 02:29:05.500
He explained that he was selected as a delegate in 1971, and next year he ran for and won a seat in this body, at the time the youngest person to do so.

1749
02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:20.000
While I may not agree with the Honorable Former Representative on Everything, it highlights that this program and others like it bridge generations, ideologies, parties, life experiences, and regions.

1750
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I've been able to meet people from across the country with whom I vehemently disagree while still being dear friends.

1751
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:45.000
That sort of civil disagreement is at the heart of the political discourse we need to return to as a state and nation for the prosperity of our country's future.

1752
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:58.500
It also drives alumni to be more involved and gives them knowledge and experience to make an impact in their communities, whether in elected office, like Mr.

1753
02:29:58.500 --> 02:30:03.500
Dupree or myself, or as private citizens advocating for change.

1754
02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:19.500
I'm honored, therefore, as a former delegate and a member of this body, to pass the baton and congratulate the New Hampshire delegates to the 63rd annual United States Senate Youth Program.

1755
02:30:19.500 --> 02:30:21.500
Mr.

1756
02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:23.500
William Brochu and Mr.

1757
02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:30.000
Ryan Casey of Concord, both of whom are here today in the gallery.

1758
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Mr.

1759
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.500
Brochu is a junior at Brewster Academy, where he's class president.

1760
02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:45.000
He entered for governor-elect Ayotte's campaign and works for his family's landscaping and construction businesses.

1761
02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:53.000
In his spare time, he volunteers with the Special Olympics in his church's local food pantry.

1762
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Mr.

1763
02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:06.500
Casey is a junior at Bishop Brady, where he's also class president and captain of the math team, science Olympiad, and soccer team.

1764
02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:17.000
He also volunteers at the McAuliffe Shepherd Discovery Center and Sycamore Community Garden, while also coaching the middle school math team.

1765
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.500
How I wish I had that kind of time.

1766
02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:35.500
I'm blown away by the accomplishments and involvement of these two, and I couldn't be more pleased to welcome them into the Senate youth family to succeed Mr.

1767
02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:37.500
Blair and I.

1768
02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:40.500
I'd also like to congratulate Mr.

1769
02:31:40.500 --> 02:31:43.500
Anthony Henry of Derry and Ms.

1770
02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:48.000
Aubrey Herzog of Claremont for their selection as alternates.

1771
02:31:48.000 --> 02:32:00.000
As a student school board member and a New Hampshire youth governor, respectively, their dedication to civic engagement in New Hampshire is truly admirable.

1772
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Mr.

1773
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Speaker, I know there are sometimes tensions with the chamber on the other side of the wall, but I concur with former Franklin resident Senator Daniel Webster in believing that, quote, it is fortunate there is a Senate of the United States, a body not yet moved from its propriety, not lost to a just sense of its own dignity, and in its own high responsibilities, a body to which the country looks with confidence for wise, moderate, and patriotic healing councils.

1774
02:32:43.000 --> 02:33:00.000
I take these words to heart and strive for my own service to reflect these principles, and I encourage these fine gentlemen to do the same as they embark on their journey to Washington.

1775
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:16.500
I sincerely hope that they come to learn what makes the Senate such a unique, deliberative body in the spirit of Senator Webster's words, navigating them towards a bright future of public service.

1776
02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:29.500
My best advice for them would be to meet as many people as possible with whom they disagree and try their best to find common ground.

1777
02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:39.000
Often your closest friends made will be the ones with whom you agree the least, or so I found.

1778
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:48.500
And perhaps there's a grain of truth in that for all of us in this chamber as well, Mr.

1779
02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:50.500
Speaker.

1780
02:33:50.500 --> 02:34:06.000
On that note, I would be remiss not to recognize my friends and fellow 2023 delegates who made the trip up today to view the New Hampshire political process in action.

1781
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.500
And boy, did they get to experience that today.

1782
02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:12.500
Mr.

1783
02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:15.000
Joshua Blake of Louisiana, Mr.

1784
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.500
Liam Drake of North Carolina, and Mr.

1785
02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:27.000
James Howard of Maryland, as well as any of the former delegates who may be watching online.

1786
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:41.000
All of these delegates, past, present, and future, embody what it means to be civically engaged as young people and represent the future of our nation's political discourse.

1787
02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Knowing them is an honor and has certainly driven me to strive to forever improve my public service.

1788
02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
I truly believe, Mr.

1789
02:34:52.000 --> 02:35:02.500
Speaker, that if these are the sort of people taking charge and leading, the vitality of our nation's future is strong.

1790
02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:06.000
Finally, I would like to thank Ms.

1791
02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.500
Rainey Guilford, the Director of the United States Senate Youth Program.

1792
02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:20.000
She has led the program since 2006 and is the reason it is what we have today.

1793
02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:37.000
She's retiring after the 2025 program, but for the last two decades, she and her team have shaped the lives of thousands of young people across our country, and should be commended for that.

1794
02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.500
And I wish her the best at whatever she does next.

1795
02:35:42.500 --> 02:36:03.000
I would also encourage each and every one of my colleagues to promote the Senate Youth Program and other civic opportunities like it in their constituencies, as well as supporting civic education reform to bolster the work that people like Ms.

1796
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Guilford have been doing for years.

1797
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
If it's proper, Mr.

1798
02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:18.500
Speaker, I would ask my honorable colleagues to rise and give these delegates a hand for their hard work and dedication.

1799
02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:21.000
Would that be all right?

1800
02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.500
Would that be all right?

1801
02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:25.500
What?

1802
02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:27.500
If it's proper, Mr.

1803
02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:38.000
Speaker, I would ask my honorable colleagues to rise and give these delegates a hand for their hard work and dedication.

1804
02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Thank you, Mr.

1805
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Speaker.

1806
02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:50.500
I yield the floor and I would ask for my remarks to be printed in the record.

1807
02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:55.500
The organizational session of 2025-2026, House of Representatives, is adjourned.

1808
02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:57.500
Thank you.
