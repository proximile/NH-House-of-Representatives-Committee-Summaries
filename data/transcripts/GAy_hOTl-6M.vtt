counsel
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
and we like to walk you through the bill
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
i'll start with the first page in the
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
analysis i wanted to point out that ols
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
calls this a technical changes to the
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
laws administered by the insurance
 
00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:22.710 align:start position:0%
laws administered by the insurance
department

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
we at the department have always
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
referred to this as an omnibus type bill
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
because there are though the changes are
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
minor and in our opinion fairly
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
innocuous they are not strictly
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
technical so that was something that ols
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
put on there that did not come from us
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
we do not consider this just to build
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
wild the changes that we're making
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe they do that so they
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
don't have to spell it all out
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
so starting with section one
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
regarding general premium tax report
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
this simplifies the the change we're
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
making here simplifies the language that
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
when an insurer submits their premium
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
tax report which is an annual thing it
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
just needs to be signed by a member of
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
the insurer's management team the
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
current language says verified by oath
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
or affirmation we're just saying let it
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
be signed and then adding the language
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the second sentence that clarifies if
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
any false information is submitted on
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
the report the person is subject to
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution per the falsification of
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
official matters statute so it's it
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're taking away the requirement that
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
it be an
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
affirmation but we're just letting them
 
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
affirmation but we're just letting them
know

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't lie
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
section two
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
our examinations in our examinations law
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
an insurer has 30 days to respond to any
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
issues contained in an
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
examination report
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
we're adding language here to make clear
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
that a request for more time to respond
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
may also be submitted during that 30-day
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
window and that is the practice we've
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
been doing but it is not clear in
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
statute that it is allowed to request
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
section 3
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
companies and agents insurance referrals
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
this changes for those instances when
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
someone is not licensed to write a
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
particular type of insurance so they
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
will refer the business to someone who
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
is properly licensed
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
typically there is a referral incentive
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
when this happens and with this change
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
we are stating that the referral fee
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
amount does not exceed 25
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's to clarify the vague reference
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
currently that says a nominal amount
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
that is that and we're saying that it
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
will not be more than 25
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
um that has been the practice but
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
now we're just putting it we're
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
codifying it in statute and just to make
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
it clear
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh section
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
four claim forms and applications
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
all forms and applications that are
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
approved in the state of new hampshire
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
require a statement that cites the
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
statute pertaining to insurance fraud
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
the current language suggests what the
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
substance of such a statement should be
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're just making the change to say no
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and put this whole
 
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.670 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and put this whole
statement

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is the exact statement that way
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's not like well does this is this the
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
substance does this meet that
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
qualification to eliminate any confusion
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
on what we're actually looking for on
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
section 5 is regarding third party
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
administrator certificate here just adds
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
party administrator include on their
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
application when they're filling that
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
out the contact info for their preferred
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
service of process agent this is so the
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
department will know who to contact for
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
that service if and when it's needed
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
section six regarding property and
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
casualty rate filings
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm currently in statute the commercial
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
inland marine insurance carriers are
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
exempt from filing their rates with the
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
department if the policy is not written
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
according to any manual rates or rating
 
00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:14.949 align:start position:0%
according to any manual rates or rating
plans

00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
plans
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
the department believes this is a
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
disincentive to carriers who use rates
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
that are supplied by rating bureaus as
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
those rates are contained in manuals
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
these rating bureaus adhere to the
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
rating standards set out in rsa41215
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
and they produce actuarially sound rates
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
that support the market and which can we
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
be relied upon with confidence so we're
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
just letting them know that it's okay to
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%

rights
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
currently an insurer is required to
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of the patient's bill of
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
rights to a policyholder
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
we are proposing a change that clarifies
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
this requirement only applies to major
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
medical policies as that is the intent
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
behind rsa 151 21 which is the patient's
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill of rights so as to eliminate any
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
possible confusion about when an insurer
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
is required to provide this document to
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
their policyholders it's just a
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
clarification does that mean not if
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're using your med pay on your auto
 
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.549 align:start position:0%
you're using your med pay on your auto
insurance

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
an example of what you don't have to do
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
an example of what you don't have to do
right

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
exactly it's only for major medical
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
policies so if you're getting a short
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
term limited duration or an ancillary
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
health product or anything like that you
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
do not need to provide that disclosure
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
that help
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
section 8
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
line 13 general group or blanket policy
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
provisions and this is just adding the
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
same language to the group policy
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
statute so
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
they don't if it's
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
the first the first to the change in
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
seven is for individual policies the
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
change in aid is for group policies the
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
same thing now it's only if it's major
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
medical does the patient's bill of
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
rights need to be given to the policy
holders

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
holders
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then sections 9 through 11
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
are the changes that will grant
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
authority to the insurance department to
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
we currently we don't have specific
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate those products we
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
do have general rulemaking and
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
regulating authority under our general
 
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.150 align:start position:0%

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
to do that so that we can do our jobs
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%

rsa 417-4
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
lays out what constitutes unfair trade
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
practices for the insurance industry
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph 9 of this statute states that
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
offering rebates as an inducement to
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
purchase insurance is prohibited
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
however subparagraph b under paragraph 9
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
describes those actions that shall not
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
be considered rebates and we are
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
proposing to include language here that
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
will not considered as rebates those
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
activities that promote the public
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
interest such as offering temporary
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
premium reductions during extenuating
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances that in fact that affect
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
the entire insurance marketplace like
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
during covid when carriers wanted to
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
reduce temporarily their premiums
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
because they weren't receiving claims
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
nobody was driving
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
section 13 refusal to issue cancellation
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and refusal of automobile insurance
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
here we are adding language to clarify
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
that a company may not issue
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me may not issue a notice of
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
cancellation for non-payment until a
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
customer does in fact not pay their
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
premium on time
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
this change will make the department's
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
position clear if there ever is an issue
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the date of a cancellation
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
section 14
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
commercial cancellation grounds grounds
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
for cancellation
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
last year if you'll remember we modified
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
the language in this statute to allow
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
for the cancellation of a commercial
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
policy at the specific request of the
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
policy holder the insured because that
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
was not before an allowed cancellation
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
and we are proposing language here to
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
make clear that the the insured must
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
still meet the noticing provisions
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
contained in their policy
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
when they request that cancellation but
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
that the company may not have more than
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
10 days to act upon the cancellation
 
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.190 align:start position:0%
10 days to act upon the cancellation
requests

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this change will eliminate any
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
confusion currently it looked like
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
before it was like it could happen
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
immediately we had some concerns from
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that they their
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
policy required more notice than
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
immediate so we are making that change
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
and section 15 continuing care
 
00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:13.029 align:start position:0%
and section 15 continuing care
communities

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 420 d9 allows the insurance
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner to file a lien against the
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
real and or personal property of the
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
provider of a community care community
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
in order to protect the interests of the
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
residents of that community if necessary
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
we are adding language here to make
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
clear that any such liens will be filed
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and registered in accordance with rsa
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
478 which is the register of deeds
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
statute as the current language and our
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
statute does not sufficiently indicate
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
how such liens are to be recorded and
 
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.110 align:start position:0%
how such liens are to be recorded and
processed

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
processed
 
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:47.909 align:start position:0%
processed
so

00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
as i say they're they're not strictly
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
technical changes but there's they're
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
pretty mild
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll answer any questions
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
well i feel like i wrote clarify
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
the statue a lot here so it feels like a
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
lot of it's just
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that people really
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what you mean exactly
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
exactly um how much of this comes from
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
the department or is any of this from
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
the audit
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
you know when you guys have audits
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
how much is so
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
um good good morning i'm heather
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
silverstein general counsel at the
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
insurance department so
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
most of these changes come from us
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
we we are working through things and we
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
realize this is not working we need to
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
change this it's not working for us it's
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
not working for industry it's not
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
working for consumers uh whatever the
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
case may be so this is our way of going
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
through and trying to fix the things
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
that are not fitting neatly like they
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
should i mean a good example of that the
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
first one was related to premium tax
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's always been an issue about
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting a notary that became even more
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
difficult during the covet emergency
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
with regard to companies having to sign
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
through a notary so this is an easy
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
switch out you sign but then you're
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
you're also saying you can't falsify the
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
report because you can get in trouble
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
for that and that that takes away that
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
these things have always been like a
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
little bit clunky it made it even worse
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
during covid
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to focus in and
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
um fix those things the same thing with
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
examination reports you know it
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be an issue that someone can
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
that a company can ask for a 30-day
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
extension to work out the details of a
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
report and to try to work with the
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
department you would want that
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility that's what we want so we
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think you might a lot of stuff here so
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
unlike the senate we don't execute bills
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
the same day because you never know
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
something people might read this and say
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
geez i need more clarification on what
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
that means so
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's worse
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
but at this point i think we're all set
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
and having no cards but i can see the
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
blue sheet uh
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%

and uh says that he is in uh big time
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
support because he did the x multiple
 
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.789 align:start position:0%
support because he did the x multiple
times

00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%

uh it this is uh this is nic
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
model law
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
and it's related to receiverships group
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
capital calculations liquidity stress
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
testing for internationally active

insurers and these changes are an
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
accreditation standard
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
and doug bartlett will help you out so i
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
just want to spend one moment for make
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
sure everybody understands what we're
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
doing what this is
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
so remember how we were talking about
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
the ucc
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
as being this model legislation that
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
comes down
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
and that model legislation is created by
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know smart lawyers and connected
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
with all across the country but it comes
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
out of chicago
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
they have created this entity in chicago
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
that creates that model legislation
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
insurance as some of you might be
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
familiar is a territory that is treated
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
sort of like the ucc in the sense that
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
um insurance regulator is uh in that
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
state so if you are
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
starting an insurance company the first
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
thing you think about is what state i
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
want to do this in because that state is
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
going to be your regulator
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay and it's very important that that
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
even though you might be selling
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
insurance products all across the
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
country or internationally wherever
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
your regulator is not the federal
 
00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
your regulator is not the federal
government

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually the insurance department
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the state in which you don't missile
 
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.510 align:start position:0%
in the state in which you don't missile
so

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
same issue came up with well we want to
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that every state is doing the
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
same deal that there aren't too many you
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
know doing anything too crazy from one
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
state to another
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that's where we get the uh national
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
association of insurance commissioners
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
and i see and i see so nic
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
that is is designed to create model
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that is then distributed to
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
the states
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they all enact it um and
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
you and you actually get rated on how
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
well you're doing in terms of uh
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
upholding the nic standards
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
and again that is the attempt to unif
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
have a uniform
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
statutes across the country
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
but that at the end of the day
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is the individual state that is the
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
regulator and with that i will then
 
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.829 align:start position:0%
regulator and with that i will then
allow

00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
any questions if anybody has any anybody
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay saying no questions
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh i have a card from

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
is the group-wise supervisor of the u.s
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
insurers in the rsui group which is part
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
of a larger allegheny group because
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are insurers within the allegheny
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
group which are mainly in the
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
transatlantic holding group that right
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
in foreign countries we need this law
 
00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
the revisions to the naic insurance
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
holding company system regulatory act
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
model 440 which is our equivalent or the
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rsa401b
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
were unanimously adopted by the neic to
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
enable the requirement for the group
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
capital calculation
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the liquidity stress test
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is an accreditation standard
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
for any state that is the lead state and
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
has insurers in a group that right in
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
foreign countries
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
and just uh
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
to to add what
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
the chairman hunt said
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
an accreditation standard in in usually
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
you see if you see an accreditation law
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
you i'm going to be the one you're
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
talking to
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's usually to do with
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know financial regulation and things
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
like the holding company and just
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
supervising uh supervising insurers
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
because you know i i you can't have
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
different states
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
having different rules
 
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.109 align:start position:0%
having different rules
for

00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:42.950 align:start position:0%
for
uh

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
insurance regulators have adopted a
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
group capital calculation
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
for use in the solvency monitoring
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
activities the calculation is intended
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
to provide additional analytical
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
information to the lead state for use in
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
assessing group risks and capital
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
adequacy to complement the current
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh holding company analysis for the u.s
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
the liquidity stress test considers the
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
financial institutions ability in the
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
absence of the market of funding
 
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.390 align:start position:0%
absence of the market of funding
liquidity

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
liquidity
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
to meet obligations during periods of
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
stress by accurately measuring the
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
liquidity profile of the balance sheet
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
in an enterprise wide level
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
these tools are in addition to other
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
tools such as enterprise risk management
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
reporting form f
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
supervisory colleges and these things
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
were added to our rsa 401b back in 19
 
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.309 align:start position:0%
were added to our rsa 401b back in 19
2014

00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
2014
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the own risk solvency report which
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
was made in separately rsa401c
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
which was enacted in 2015. so it's it's
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
just a as as new tools come along we add
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
them to the holding company law and i
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
great any questions from anybody and
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
quite a long document somebody
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think yes
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
we know better than to ask doug any
 
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.150 align:start position:0%
we know better than to ask doug any
questions

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
questions
all right

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
so representative pull that microphone
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
real close to you okay so if i
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
understand correctly uh
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a designated is a lead
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
state is that what you said it's a lead
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
state for the group
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
the lead state is determined
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
let's say you have five companies
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
the company that rights to the state
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
because it could be more than one
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
company in the state in this case three
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the companies are in new hampshire
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay and we have the volume
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
of premium in the united states
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
therefore we're designated as the lead
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
state okay so okay so in other words
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
if i understand correctly these changes
 
00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:55.109 align:start position:0%
if i understand correctly these changes
uh

00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
enough liquidity or whatever the word is
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
collateral so that these
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
corporations can stay in the state and
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes and so they can operate in the world
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
some of the numbers are really big so
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
well this is this is like i say is it is
 
00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:23.510 align:start position:0%
well this is this is like i say is it is
this

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know we are also the lead for delta
 
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.069 align:start position:0%
you know we are also the lead for delta
dental

00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
dental
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
well you know they're not going to be
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
writing in foreign countries
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh saying the hanover they're not going
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
to be lead for the hanover they're not
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to be ready in four countries but
 
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.270 align:start position:0%
going to be ready in four countries but
this

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
this company happens to have
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh members um
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
or insurers within the group
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
that right in foreign countries okay so
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
what we were accomplishing here and it
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
sounds to me that
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
we want our status to remain that's what
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
we need to do
 
00:55:58.079 --> 00:55:59.030 align:start position:0%
we need to do
yes

00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
think of it like a bond rating
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
and we want to we want to be triple a
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
so we do we do this we keep up to date
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
and and as long as you dot the eyes and
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
cross the t's then you
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
you have that credibility
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
and this is really for insurance
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners of other states or
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
countries to say evaluate
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
a company who's coming in to sell their
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
product if they want to decide whether
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
they really want them to be in their
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
state or in their country is to say okay
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
so let's look at their regulator and is
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
their regulator got the aaa
 
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.670 align:start position:0%
their regulator got the aaa
ranking

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.270 align:start position:0%
would you believe
yes

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
let's see i have nobody online
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
and joan again is uh
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
from the big eye is in support of the
 
00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
from the big eye is in support of the
bill

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
 
00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:18.870 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the public
hearing

01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
we open up the public area in house bill
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
1019 the prime sponsor is unable to make
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
the analysis states this bill
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study the
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
replacement of certain professional
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
licenses with mandatory minimum
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
liability insurance requirements
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative mike harrington is the
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor and i'm going to read what he
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
asked me to read
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt and commerce committee
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
commerce and consumer affairs committee

members i am the prime sponsor of hp
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
1019 but due to a change in my schedule
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
i am not able to attend today's hearing
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
so i am
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
submitting this written testimony
 
01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.709 align:start position:0%
submitting this written testimony
instead

01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
instead
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would establish a committee to
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
study the replacement of certain
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
professional licenses with mandatory
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
liability insurance requirements
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
over the years there have been a
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
proliferation of laws requiring a state
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
license to perform various professions
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
the thought being that if the government
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
does not regulate and licenses those
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
performing these occupations the public
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
safety would be in jeopardy
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would study the possibility of
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
requiring liability insurance instead of
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
obtaining a government license
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
this effectively would have the
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
underwriting insurance company regulate
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
the profession
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is not new con this is not a new
 
01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
this is not new con this is not a new
concept

01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies impose many
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
requirements on their policy holders and
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
perform inspections to be sure that they
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
are met
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
this idea is being looked at by other
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
states and the study committee would
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
investigate as to whether this approach
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
could or would work for new hampshire
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
i would like to leave you with a with an
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
example of a potentially very dangerous
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
profession where there is no government
 
01:19:09.199 --> 01:19:10.709 align:start position:0%
profession where there is no government
regulations

01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
oversight or professional licensing
 
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.870 align:start position:0%
oversight or professional licensing
requirements

01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
that profession is scuba diver
 
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
that profession is scuba diver
instructor

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
instructor
 
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.830 align:start position:0%
instructor
scuba

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
scuba
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
is excuse me scuba diver instructors are
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
certified by private organizations such
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
as the professional association of
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
diving instructor instructors padi
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
there are no laws that dictate how they
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
they develop their own standards and
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
have certified thousands of instructors
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
who have certified millions of students
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
so what are the results
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
while scuba diving puts one in a hostile
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
environment where lack of proper
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
training and
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
equipment could lead to death it has
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
been shown to be a very safe activity
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
who could have imagined
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
properly chained people performing what
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
could be a dangerous activity in a very
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
safe manner without any government
 
01:20:08.239 --> 01:20:10.550 align:start position:0%
safe manner without any government
involvement

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
the rules of organizations such as padi
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
go beyond just training however
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
try to get on a dive boat or rent dive
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
equipment without a diver certification
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
card and you will be quickly told no way
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
again there is no law that prevents this
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
just the fear of liability should
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
someone rent diving equipment to someone
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
who is not certified
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to give this bill
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
careful considerations and i will be
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions after 2 13
 
01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions after 2 13
february

01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
february
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
p.s if i'm mike i checked the new
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws and there are only two
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
that deal with scuba diving both deal
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
with navigation and state requirements
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
for putting up a flag while diving and
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
the penalties for boats that go into the
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
boating exclusion area around the flag
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%

opposition to the bill thank you mr
 
01:21:58.159 --> 01:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill thank you mr
chairman

01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
electricians board i am the vice
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
chairman of the new hampshire
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
electricians board and have been for a
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 52 different
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
organizations under the oplc
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
where we have licensed
 
01:22:16.719 --> 01:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
where we have licensed
individuals

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
liability insurance
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
covers bodily injury and property damage
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have nothing to do with
 
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.350 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have nothing to do with
enforcement

01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
and as electricians there are things
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
that if done wrong
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's not only getting licenses which is
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with making sure you have
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
certain education
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
requirements and certain
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
amount of hours
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
then has to do with enforcement and when
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement finds that people violated
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
the rules they can been brought forth
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
in some kind of disciplinary action
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
my wife also used to serve on the
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetology board
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
similar things there
 
01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
similar things there
where

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
places where
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
utilizing or violating
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
their licenses by utilizing
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals and other things
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
that were either banned in the state of
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
or they were doing things that were
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
harming individuals
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know that very well
 
01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.470 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know that very well
representative

01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
representative
um

01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
this does not work in every mechanism it
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
may for some of the smaller ones scuba
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
self-contained underwater breathing
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
apparatus i loved learning that when i
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
was a kid
 
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.430 align:start position:0%
was a kid
so

01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
that may be so in that case and i know
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to reduce the amount of
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
occupations that are licensed
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
some may be frivolous and not needed but
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
by and large some of the major
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
licenses held
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
and managed by the oplc
 
01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.550 align:start position:0%
and managed by the oplc
offer

01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
the education
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
training enforcement
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
for not following those rules and it is
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
important and it can't be done
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
just through a liability policy as you
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
know also no
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm the national member of the new
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire insurance agents association
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
on a national level
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
as i said it's bodily injury and
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
property damage is covered by a
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
liability policy much more narrow but i
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
will let our executive director speak
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
from an insurance standpoint
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
so i know there's a study committee and
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
i know we're really happy to have study
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
committees these days but um this is uh
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh applicable for some of the major
 
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.350 align:start position:0%
uh applicable for some of the major
licenses

01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
that are held here in the state thank
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i was going to ask john
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
the question but i'll ask you first and
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
then junk and answer it
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
so i when i first read this i was a
 
01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.110 align:start position:0%
so i when i first read this i was a
little

01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh confused i wasn't sure exactly where
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's going obviously we heard the
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
because i always think about
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
we have requirements for bonding
 
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
we have requirements for bonding
requirements

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
but the idea that we have
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
liability insurance requirements in
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the other i mean i don't know
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
you sell these products how often are
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
you complying with somebody's insurance
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
you know a legislative mandate that they
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
have liability insurance versus just the
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
i know as a legislature we try to stay
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
out of putting
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
insurance limits in
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
law we do have so in the condo law i
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
know but we try to keep it up because
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know what what limit you put in now
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
10 years from now is going to be
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
obsolete so we try to stay away from
 
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.390 align:start position:0%
obsolete so we try to stay away from
that

01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
bonding the two types of bonding you're
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
talking about mr chairman uh one is a
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
financial guarantee uh to
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
complete a compet to complete a
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
construction type project it covers um
 
01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.910 align:start position:0%
construction type project it covers um
uh

01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
performance bond
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
guarantees the performance of the
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
project the payment bond guarantees that
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
it will be paid the other type of bond
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
fidelity bond
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
guarantees you will follow the rules or
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
you will pay a penalty
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
right fidelity bond yeah but
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
but i know like real estate agents so we
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
we require a bond 25 000 bond a lot of
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
times that has to do with because
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
they're taking deposits you're taking a
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
i don't really know there's ever going
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be a fine that that's going to be
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
paid for i think it's a financial
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
portion of that
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay but again liability is bodily
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
injury and property damage has nothing
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
to do with some of the other things
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
other reasons a um a license in place
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh all the rules and we have in place
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
for the electrician's board i don't
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
believe there's any insurance criteria
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
to totally do that's what i'm saying
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
most bond they don't have insurance
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirements they might have some
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
bonding requirements but they don't have
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
insurance requirements that's what i'm
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
thinking that's correct
 
01:26:59.199 --> 01:27:00.310 align:start position:0%
thinking that's correct
okay

01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
great all right thank you very much for
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
all right so i i'm sorry ross i saw john
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
i missed jones card so let me have her
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
come up first and then you can get the
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
chance to wrap it up
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay joan
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe you want to tell people what
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
the big eye means
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%

hampshire big eye and i serve as their
lobbyist

01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%

our members are the independent
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
insurance agents located in all the
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
communities across the united across new
 
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.110 align:start position:0%
communities across the united across new
hampshire

01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
there are over 200
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
agencies our members have over 200
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
office locations throughout the state
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to this bill
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that the bill is to
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
establish a committee i think it's
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
important to look at the goal
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
which is to replace certain licenses
 
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
with an insurance policy professionals
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
especially in
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
and speaking for the insurance
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
industry work hard to become licensed we
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
study we pass an exam
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then through continuing education we
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
learn we continue to learn the nuances
 
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.270 align:start position:0%
learn we continue to learn the nuances
of

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
one's chosen career
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
consumers rely
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
on professionals to give good advice
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
provide quality services and products
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
and the best way to make sure that
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
getting this good advice is to verify
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
the professional is licensed
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
we believe
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
substituting a hard-earned license
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
required regulated by the state for an
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
insurance policy that could be canceled
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
the day after it's taken
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
is putting consumers at great risk
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to try to answer
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
great so if i get your testimony
 
01:29:08.390 --> 01:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
correctly he said
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we put this in the statute somebody's
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
got to look over to make sure that that
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
license that liability insurance is
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
always in place
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that's usually what a a licensure
 
01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.629 align:start position:0%
and that's usually what a a licensure
board

01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
would be doing or a licensed board is
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to make sure that the professional
 
01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.790 align:start position:0%
going to make sure that the professional
is

01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining and is in good standing with
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
their license
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know a good professional is going to
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're properly covered
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
with the insurance industry they
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
purchase professional liability
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
so if they make a mistake an insurance
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
company is going to step in to represent
 
01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:42.470 align:start position:0%
company is going to step in to represent
them

01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the event that they're sued
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
what i see with this bill is that
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
they are putting
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
the onus onto the insurance company to
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that that professional is
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
rising to the standard that the the
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
consumer needs and i think that
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
is a mistake again because an insurance
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
policy can be purchased today
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much thank you
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
committee for holding this hearing today
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is ross
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
connolly i'm the deputy state director
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
for americans for prosperity
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh we are neutral on the bill but we
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
support its intent
 
01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
support its intent
uh

01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
for for a host of reasons uh
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
occupational licensure is is the most
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
burdensome form of government regulation
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
requires thousands of hours in some
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
cases of training
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
lots of monetary investment as well and
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
according to the institute for justice
 
01:30:58.550 --> 01:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
their study license to work showed 16 of
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's workforces licensed and
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
due to onerous uh regulations associated
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
with those licenses an estimated eight
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty two jobs are lost
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
and and before the pandemic
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
the department of employment security
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
cited barriers to entry as a driving
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
force behind uh granite staters not
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
being able uh to acquire a a job and
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
that has only been exacerbated for from
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
what we've seen
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh post-pandemic or or during the
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh that
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
this barrier is is difficult for people
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
to cross to especially low-income folks
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
to to enter into licensed fields
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
so we support uh looking at alternatives
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
to licensure that removes some of those
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
barriers that are preventing people from
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
entering the license field but also
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
protects consumer safety i i can't speak
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to this i only found out
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
but uh so i can't speak specifically to
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
the limited liability insurance but we
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
do uh use uh
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
hold up this chart of just uh some
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
alternatives to licensure that
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislators can look at this was
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
something we supported a couple years
 
01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:14.470 align:start position:0%
something we supported a couple years
ago

01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
it was called the board reform act and
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
and it would have created a committee
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
similar to this bill but having all
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
these options that the committee could
 
01:32:23.199 --> 01:32:24.709 align:start position:0%
these options that the committee could
analyze

01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
analyze
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
alternatives to licensure uh that that
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
does still protect uh consumer safety so
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
things like fraud depending on the
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
industry uh
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
there's a correlative
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
option that that we can list that that
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
reduces that burden but uh protects the
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:46.310 align:start position:0%
public safety
um

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
as as has been pointing out that this
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
bill all it does from my reading is it
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to study this i
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
i would advise maybe having some other
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
options for
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh for licensure not just the limited
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
liability insurance as
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
as has been pointed out that may not
 
01:33:02.639 --> 01:33:03.910 align:start position:0%
as has been pointed out that may not
cover

01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
be a good option for every single
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
industry that's licensed so having some
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
other other options uh would probably be
 
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.550 align:start position:0%
other other options uh would probably be
advisable

01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
advisable
 
01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.310 align:start position:0%
advisable
um

01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
again we support the intent uh we
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
applaud the sponsor for for looking for
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
these options since this is it's one of
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
of of licensed fields it's one of the
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
highest amount of people employed in the
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
state uh so it's a huge amount of the
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
workforce and and we should be looking
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
at alternatives to make that easier so
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd be happy to try and
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that could
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
represented burroughs has a question
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
yes i don't know if you can answer it if
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative petusa can i'm wondering
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
if there are any specific industries
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
that were of concern when the bill was
 
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.030 align:start position:0%
that were of concern when the bill was
written

01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
he's not the sponsor
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
no i know he's not but i asked if he
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
might no
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative i i i can't speak to to
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
what uh industries the sponsor may have
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
had in mind uh i but there there are
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
many fields and there's
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
a whole host of bills if you go talk to
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcguire over an edna
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure she'll she'll tell you about
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
the list of bills that that they get uh
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
looking at making changes there was one
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
on athlete's agents there last year
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
there was one to remove the license for
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
lightning rod inspectors
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
things like that we have a lot of
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
licenses where there could be
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
improvements uh made to statute to
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
reduce that burden whether it's just the
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
the regulations on the amount of hours
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
required or or the fees included
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of areas we could look at
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh i but unfortunately i can speak to
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
what the sponsor had in mind thank you
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative below
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a licensed cosmetology i have been
 
01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.750 align:start position:0%
i'm a licensed cosmetology i have been
for

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
nearly 50 years
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
and um close to the mic um for several
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
years i've been a cosmetologist and i
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
did go through
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
the course
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
the you know and um the licensing um you
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
know the
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
the test that you have to take
 
01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.629 align:start position:0%
the test that you have to take
and

01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
we learned an awful lot i mean there's a
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
lot involved in cosmetology
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
so would you feel comfortable going to a
 
01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:32.550 align:start position:0%
so would you feel comfortable going to a
salon

01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
salon
 
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
salon
where

01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
the hairdresser or the barber
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
was not um
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
didn't go in it didn't go through any
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
type of you know
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
licensing uh procedure or
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh the 1600 hours
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative i i would say it depends
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh so it depends of what it would be
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
replaced with if we just remove the
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
license and replace it with nothing
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's probably not a very good idea i i
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
think having something to to back up and
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
protect consumer safety
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and whether you know cosmetology and
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very wide-ranging field
 
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.430 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very wide-ranging field
uh

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
years ago we we got rid of the license
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
for hair braiders since hair braiders
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
were required to have uh the full
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
cosmetology license even though they
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
only covered one specific area so i i
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
think looking at uh each industry of
 
01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.590 align:start position:0%
think looking at uh each industry of
where

01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
some of those those regulations may not
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
be necessary is probably a good place to
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
start i you know starting with let's
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
just get rid of all the licenses uh
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
would not be a good move for consumer
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
safety so i think having a commission
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
that could look at what areas could be
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
changed without putting the public at
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
risk and uh you know
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
opening up that field to more people
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be a good good route to take so
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
studying it instead of jumping ahead
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
would probably be the better route to
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
take and just a follow up for the
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
question main choir yes
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
if there is a study committee formed and
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is not a hairdresser or
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
how would you make decisions
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
relating to that industry
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative i i think uh as this bill
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
is i believe it's all members of the
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislature uh so similar to someone
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
like jail car looking at uh this and
 
01:37:35.119 --> 01:37:35.830 align:start position:0%
like jail car looking at uh this and
just

01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
but opposed the jail car they wouldn't
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
have any actual power it would be
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
advising uh the committees like this one
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
on what uh changes they could make uh
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
since the licensing fields again there's
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh it can be very complicated going
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
through each each license
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh so i
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
i i think that's sort of the the
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
direction to go in uh is having the
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and a member like yourself
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
could be part of that that commission
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
that does have experience in that field
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:10.639 --> 01:38:12.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:14.470 align:start position:0%
representative
next

01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
taking our questions uh would you agree
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh that there's a there's a goldilocks
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
zone when it comes to regulating
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
industries it's you know not too hot not
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
too cold just right
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
and it's a balance between consumer
 
01:38:29.199 --> 01:38:30.709 align:start position:0%
and it's a balance between consumer
protection

01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
and protectionism within the industry
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree and uh could
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
you speak to that
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative yes i i would agree that
 
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.669 align:start position:0%
representative yes i i would agree that
um

01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
there is a certain amount of
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
protectionism within licensed fields uh
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know obviously if somebody goes
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
through the training goes through
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
a very onerous and burdemsome
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
system to get to get their license they
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
may not want others to uh to have an
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
easier time uh but i i think
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh largely it's it's more of driven
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
by this idea that it does protect
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
consumer safety we have there's multiple
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
studies that show depending on the
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
license field that it actually
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to protect consumer
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
safety and again there's
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
many many many lists and i i can submit
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
that to the committee in written
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
testimony of
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
fields that are currently licensed in
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that may not
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
and that an alternative would be a much
 
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.310 align:start position:0%
and that an alternative would be a much
better

01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to leave aside the idea that
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
in this bill and we're just going to
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
we're asking for a study committee that
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
would go through the house
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
go through session go over to the senate
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
um go through the senate committee
 
01:39:57.679 --> 01:39:59.669 align:start position:0%
um go through the senate committee
process

01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
if it were passed then it has to go to
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
before this could happen and this is the
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
second year of a biennium put that all
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
aside to see if this could all get done
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
before july
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
july because we don't meet after july
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
and then we've got campaigns
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
probably makes the fall pretty tough
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
um how do you think that
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
just in just looking at this bill
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
the enforcement would be addressed would
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
that be government enforcing or would
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
that be insurance companies enforcing to
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was a liability
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
policy in place
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:36.390 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
representative

01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
as i pointed out in my testimony i can't
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
speak directly to the the insurance
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
liability portion of this bill i i don't
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
know how
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh that that will actually
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
impact things we were just speaking
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
generally to looking at alternatives to
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
licensure uh
 
01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
licensure uh
it's

01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
how how it would play out what we would
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
prefer would be similar to the board
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
reform act which over the course we we
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
predict this would take years to
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
actually go through every licensed field
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
look at every little regulation
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh so we we would probably prefer to
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
have a prolonged uh commission that that
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
can oversee this since it would take a
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
lot of time and effort to go through
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
this and as as you pointed out that
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's probably not going to be the case
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
in in this this year
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh so i i would probably advise to
 
01:41:28.470 --> 01:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
stretch out that time period of that
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
they would have to study uh the licenses
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
um yes you you mentioned that you had a
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
list of uh
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
occupations that you didn't think uh
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
licensing was
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
was necessary do you have that list i
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see that list and i would
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that you have the reason
 
01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that you have the reason
why

01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
you don't think that
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
a license might be needed thank you
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative we have a just an initial
 
01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
look at you can look at the institute
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
for justices licensed to work that's
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's a great place to start where they
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
look at the the low income
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the most burdensome we look
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
we consider those low income entry level
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
positions that that that's where we're
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
not talking about doctors lawyers
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh some of the really highly technical
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
fields some of the those lower entry
 
01:42:23.119 --> 01:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
fields some of the those lower entry
level

01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
fields uh we believe that uh changes can
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
be made to reduce that that burden of
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
entering the field a lot of people that
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
are low income
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
can't for instance pay tens of thousands
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
of dollars for training and take years
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
to to go through
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh all of the
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
the hour requirements uh so
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's looking at
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
eliminating a license like lightning
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
rods or
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
last year this legislature removed uh
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the law that made it illegal to cut
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
somebody else's hair without pay uh that
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
was kind of made national news
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
those little things are are an area that
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
we can look at of removing some of those
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh those areas that it's obvious that
 
01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.669 align:start position:0%
uh those areas that it's obvious that
this

01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have much of an impact
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative herbert
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
has a question a commission a question
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
to the chair
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay is it uh representative is it
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
harrington yes um
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
what's stopping the representative from
 
01:43:33.430 --> 01:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to what was the opla
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh and requesting uh we don't license we
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't require people's
 
01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
we don't discuss people's motives or
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
objectives or what they're doing when if
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
you see him you sure the subcommittee
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
will take it up but
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually i'll get to where i think the
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
question really should be
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that is uh when you have a study
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee you don't want it to be too
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
wide range you have a very limited time
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
which i thought represented butler was
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to go it's a limited time to get
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill out of committee get it
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
make a
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion for the next biennium
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
so my preference would be is that you
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
you call through your list there and
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
actually identify
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
specific licenses
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you think that that we could help
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
normally this is done by eda and dna and
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
carol has done a lot of this work
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
already but it's here so we'll look at
 
01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:27.590 align:start position:0%
already but it's here so we'll look at
it

01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:28.550 align:start position:0%
it
but

01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
it would be very helpful for me if i
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to really
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
pass this bill is to actually pick out a
 
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
pass this bill is to actually pick out a
license

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
that that it's worth
 
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.470 align:start position:0%
that that it's worth
considering

01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
considering
 
01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.390 align:start position:0%
considering
absolutely

01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i i agree and and
 
01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i i agree and and
uh

01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
luckily right right now there's there's
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
many bills that are addressing that
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
going through uh edna uh whether it's
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
athletes agents
 
01:44:54.159 --> 01:44:55.030 align:start position:0%
athletes agents
uh

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
actually that went through judiciary but
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
there there's a host of of bills out
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
there that peop that representatives
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
have i identified as as being some of
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
the most egregious
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
great so
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
i i'd be happy to if you could help i'll
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
represent here because i'm going to say
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
the same thing to him i mean pick
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
something out but in terms of just
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
saying you know go over the transom and
 
01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
find something you need i guess you
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
would start with a list of licensures
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
and say and then
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
whatever but yeah
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
you get what i'm looking for absolutely
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i i appreciate the
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
sentiment again our intent our our
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
support is for the intent behind this
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
building that's just looking at changes
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
all right representative has another
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
question yeah um thank you mr chair get
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
close to that mike thank you for taking
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
um as i read the bill it says there is
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
established no
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
establish a committee to study the
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
replacement of certain professional
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
licenses with mandatory minimum
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
um someone from the insurance division
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
came in and spoke about limited
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
liability insurance um
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
it would not be workable
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
and number two um it really a study
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee is it should be studying the
 
01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.149 align:start position:0%
committee is it should be studying the
licensures

01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
licensures
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
and not come up with
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
a replacement which would be mandatory
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
minimum liability insurance if you
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
want this bill to move forward i think
 
01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
we need an amendment so that it just
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't focus on minimum liability
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
insurance requirements replacing
 
01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
insurance requirements replacing
licensures

01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
licensures
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative i i would agree i i i
 
01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.109 align:start position:0%
representative i i would agree i i i
think

01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know taking a one-size-fits-all
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
solution to licensure isn't the best
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
route it again it doesn't
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh limited liability insurance would not
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
be an effective replacement for every
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
single license field i i think uh that
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
that sort of restrains what the the
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee can look at to of some of
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
these other alternatives uh so i would
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
tend to agree with you thank you
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah actually that's the one last
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
question i have
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
that chart you showed about all the
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
where's liability insurance on that
 
01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.990 align:start position:0%
where's liability insurance on that
chart

01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
how high up the list is it
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
so we have uh
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
it goes through things like market
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
competition uh consumer uh created
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
ratings and review aka yelp uber
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
private certifications which seems like
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
what the sponsor was going for
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to to scuba diving
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
their private certification
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary bonding and insurance is an
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
option but again it's not
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are many options inspections
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
regular regulation so where was that on
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
the level is that down at the near the
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
bottom or is that it just these are just
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the middle uh but the ranking is not
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
based on uh what is the best it's it's
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
what are the options uh based on well i
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
thought that the the bottom was the was
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
the best bottom was minimum minimal
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
minimal regulation so it goes from and
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to send this yeah that
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
it goes from licensure it's just the the
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
ranking of burden
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh so the ranking of what someone has to
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
go through it starts at the bottom with
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
licensure as the most burden and market
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
competition yeah just email that to the
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
committee members that'd be fun
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%

01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%

i am here to present house bill 1048
 
03:18:32.550 --> 03:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
relative to minimum non-forfeiture
 
03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
amounts under the standard
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
non-forfeiture law for individual
 
03:18:39.190 --> 03:18:39.200 align:start position:0%

03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
the analysis this bill will modify the
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
interest rate used in determining
 
03:18:48.550 --> 03:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
minimum non-forfeiture amounts
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay i am introducing
 
03:18:53.110 --> 03:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
i am introducing house bill 1048 at the
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
request of the insurance department to
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate the recent interest rate for
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
annuities that was adopted
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the national association of insurance
 
03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:05.110 align:start position:0%
by the national association of insurance
commissioners

03:19:05.110 --> 03:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
and aic
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
to their nan
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
their standard non-forfeiture model law
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry is very much in
 
03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
favor of this proposal
 
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
heather silverstein is here from the
 
03:19:19.990 --> 03:19:20.000 align:start position:0%

okay heather
silverson

03:19:46.630 --> 03:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:19:49.830 --> 03:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
you just have to make sure it's on and
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
pull it close
 
03:19:53.670 --> 03:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
03:19:53.680 --> 03:19:58.630 align:start position:0%
is that better
closer

03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm heather silverstein
 
03:20:01.750 --> 03:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
i'm general counsel from the insurance
 
03:20:01.760 --> 03:20:02.790 align:start position:0%
i'm general counsel from the insurance
department

03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
and um this bill is again
 
03:20:08.469 --> 03:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
one where we're trying to sync up our
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
practice at the department with what the
 
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
national association of insurance
 
03:20:13.830 --> 03:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners has recommended through
 
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
their model law uh is 805 in particular
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
for the model law that we're talking
 
03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
about here is for individual deferred
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
annuities so this is just the situation
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
when someone has
 
03:20:26.550 --> 03:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
been making payments on an annuity and
 
03:20:28.150 --> 03:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
then they stop making payments it's kind
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
of an accumulation phase then what what
 
03:20:32.950 --> 03:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
money are they going to get back so it's
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
the value of their annuity at the time
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
and then there's other factors that come
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
in in this law and one of the things
 
03:20:40.239 --> 03:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
in in this law and one of the things
that

03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:43.510 --> 03:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
happened at the neic was industry was
 
03:20:45.750 --> 03:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
saying hey you're making it really hard
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
for us to even market these products
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
because the interest rates have been so
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
low you know you take it like u.s
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
treasury bonds and whatnot but the
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
interest rates have been really really
 
03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
low so to
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
have to use this one percent interest
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
rate that's not really
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
working when we have to um
 
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
provide this return this non-forfeiture
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
amount and so that's how it came at the
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
national level where they reduce the
 
03:21:11.429 --> 03:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
rate at the national level and again
 
03:21:13.110 --> 03:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a floor because if the
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
interest rate went up there's going to
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
be some competition there so they could
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
always charge a higher interest rate
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
like for what the consumer would get
 
03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
back if they wanted to
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
and so um we
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
like to be um consistent with what other
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
states do in in this particular area and
 
03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:30.550 align:start position:0%
states do in in this particular area and
so

03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh industry is in support of this and so
 
03:21:34.710 --> 03:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're just syncing up our law with what
 
03:21:37.110 --> 03:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
um other states have done and what the
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from committee
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
could you
 
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
in everyday language explain
 
03:21:57.030 --> 03:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
what what this uh non-forfeiture
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh interest uh
 
03:21:59.279 --> 03:22:00.150 align:start position:0%
uh interest uh
uh

03:22:00.150 --> 03:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
is all about for those of us who don't
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
deal with us
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
ever well so for the best is basically
 
03:22:09.349 --> 03:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know like i said when there is a a
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
surrender you know like i i've been
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
paying on an annuity and then i've just
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
decided i don't you know i don't want to
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
do this anymore for the consumer they
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
want to
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
maybe you should tell them what an
 
03:22:22.710 --> 03:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
annuity is annuity is uh yes
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
is is in the life insurance type world
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it's an investment and it's meant
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
for longer term okay
 
03:22:33.190 --> 03:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
but what happens is there's times when
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
somebody just decides i don't want to do
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
this anymore whether they can't afford
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
the payments or they don't want to be
 
03:22:39.750 --> 03:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
they don't want to invest in this
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
anymore it's an investment product it's
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
an insurance product that we regulate
 
03:22:47.349 --> 03:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
um that's not like a securities we don't
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
regulate that okay
 
03:22:51.190 --> 03:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
so um i guess that would be the simplest
 
03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
way so then when the consumer wants to
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
get out this law is focusing on what are
 
03:22:58.389 --> 03:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
the minimum amounts that the company
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
would have to return to the consumer and
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
it's their value at the time that they
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
want to get out and then now
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
the one percent interest rate which was
 
03:23:08.469 --> 03:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
one of the factors that's the part that
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't working because the interest
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
rates have been so low and i gave the
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
example of the treasury bonds so that's
 
03:23:18.389 --> 03:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
why we we made that adjustment so
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay rich
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah just one quick follow-up so this is
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the payment from
 
03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
the payment from
the

03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
company to the individual
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
that it could be paid at a low with a
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
lower interest rate yes that's correct
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.279 --> 03:23:38.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you

30 seconds okay
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah representative matthew later
 
03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
just a quick question what's the
 
03:25:20.550 --> 03:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
non-forfeiture rate for life insurance
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
i am not sure i don't want to answer
 
03:25:29.349 --> 03:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
that without knowing that for sure
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:33.680 --> 03:25:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm asking this is the lieutenant
 
03:25:39.359 --> 03:25:41.269 align:start position:0%
i'm asking this is the lieutenant
colombo

03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
colombo
 
03:25:41.279 --> 03:25:44.389 align:start position:0%
colombo
question

03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
explain to me why
 
03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:48.229 align:start position:0%
explain to me why
allowing

03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
the company to pay
 
03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:51.750 align:start position:0%
the company to pay
less

03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's more a matter of the
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
national standard where the interest
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
rates have become so low that there is
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
now needs to be a floor
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh where the companies would reimburse
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the consumer at that percentage
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and that's just because of the rates
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
so this is better for the consumer
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
because right now they're cutting off at
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
one so now we're allowing it to go lower
 
03:26:33.590 --> 03:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative johnson
 
03:26:42.550 --> 03:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just so
 
03:26:44.469 --> 03:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
i understand this because i'm kind of
 
03:26:47.510 --> 03:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
new to the insurance pieces of this
 
03:26:49.349 --> 03:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
so if i have an annuity say for a
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
just an example
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
cut off say
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the way you know after
 
03:27:00.550 --> 03:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know 10 years or whatever
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
i'm only going to get 15 percent
 
03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
or point 15
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
of that back
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
of 1 is that no it's the value that you
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
have in the annuity plus the interest
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
over and above that if i'm not mistaken
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right so i i just not just
 
03:27:23.910 --> 03:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
point one five percent of the 100 000.
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay so no i that's why i just wanted
 
03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
some clarification because i was i was
 
03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
getting a little confused so that's why
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
i asked thank you
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but let's keep remember the one
 
03:27:32.880 --> 03:27:33.830 align:start position:0%
yeah but let's keep remember the one
percent

03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
was the floor the under one percent they
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:41.190 --> 03:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
pay anything so what this is doing is
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
lowering that threshold so the consumer
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.439 --> 03:27:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:48.389 --> 03:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
question of the chair before
 
03:27:53.110 --> 03:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
would you just expand upon if it's less
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
than one percent they don't have to pay
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
anything yeah that right what what's one
 
03:27:57.359 --> 03:27:59.190 align:start position:0%
anything yeah that right what what's one
percent

03:27:59.190 --> 03:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the value of the whatever the
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
principal value the annuity at the time
 
03:28:04.319 --> 03:28:05.030 align:start position:0%
principal value the annuity at the time
of

03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
when you stop paying it when the
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
you stop paying it so it now has the
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
cash value to cash out as cash value so
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
the question was and maybe maybe we'll
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
have somebody else
 
03:28:27.110 --> 03:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
miss overseeing explain this better
 
03:28:28.469 --> 03:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of interest but i'm
 
03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
saying that you're saying was that the
 
03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
one percent was assuming it was back in
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
the days when everybody was going to be
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
five six was you know the sky was the
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
limit what interest rates used to be so
 
03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
in this case what they're saying is it
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
so for some reason in it was ni naic
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
model legislation that they had a
 
03:28:49.990 --> 03:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
threshold of one if it was under one
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
then there was nothing
 
03:28:52.950 --> 03:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance company didn't have to
 
03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
give you anything so if there's a
 
03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
non-forfeiture value
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
of a thousand dollars
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay you one percent
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
interest on that
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
plus the thousand dollars which is the
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
north forfeiture value or is the non for
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
forfeiture value one percent
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
of something so simon what why do we
 
03:29:12.630 --> 03:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
have yeah
 
03:29:14.469 --> 03:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you i apologize because because
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering in an era where interest
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
rates are fluctuating i understand
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
i understand generally speaking what the
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
motivation is because we're living in a
 
03:29:25.110 --> 03:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
low interest rate environment but we're
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
also we're facing the prospect of
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
interest rates rising again and my
 
03:29:33.429 --> 03:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
concern is if we set this at .15
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
what would be the deleterious
 
03:29:35.680 --> 03:29:37.030 align:start position:0%
what would be the deleterious
consequences

03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
for the policy because it's this is just
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
all this well then who determines what
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
the interest rate is
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh because it says three percent and one
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
percent so now we're talking about point
 
03:29:48.070 --> 03:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
one five to three the range point one
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
five to three rather than one two three
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative i'm gonna have miss
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
silverstein oh okay thank you yes the
 
03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
statue i believe yes
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you nancy right thank you we don't
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
need a hired hand too thank you
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
you're just here to support it you had a
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
reason why he wrote 30 seconds because
 
03:30:06.880 --> 03:30:08.309 align:start position:0%
reason why he wrote 30 seconds because
so

03:30:08.309 --> 03:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
again that's heather silverstein from
 
03:30:12.070 --> 03:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance department so this i have
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
the statue printed out
 
03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:14.469 align:start position:0%
the statue printed out
so

03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:16.550 --> 03:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the 409 a4
 
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
is what we're modifying and we're only
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
modifying a piece of that
 
03:30:22.710 --> 03:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
and what this relates to is saying these
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
are the minimum non-forfeiture amounts
 
03:30:28.150 --> 03:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
and talking about the paid up annuities
 
03:30:29.670 --> 03:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding from what this is is
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
that your the value of what the annuity
 
03:30:37.110 --> 03:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
is at the time plus this interest rate
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
so before it was a one percent
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
payback now we've lowered the floor and
 
03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that we set an
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
example like a dollar amount that a
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
typical annuity might have been and so
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
people can do the math thousand plus one
 
03:30:50.950 --> 03:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
percent of that okay so you're getting
 
03:30:52.469 --> 03:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
your hundred thousand if that's the
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
value plus one percent plus the one
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
percent now the floor is going to be
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
lower and part of that is because of the
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
availability of these products
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
the the industry is saying to us we
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
can't keep on offering new contracts
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
with this interest rate
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
and so if we have to pay the money back
 
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
okay if somebody surrenders so we're
 
03:31:14.830 --> 03:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're effectively saying we're in a
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
non-competitive environment due to the
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
regulation that we can't go below one
 
03:31:21.510 --> 03:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
percent exactly and so we're trying to
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
lower it we then then we will be able to
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
continue to offer these products and if
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
the interest rates can go up this is not
 
03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
a problem because this is just a floor
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be competing against
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
other issuers
 
03:31:34.950 --> 03:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
so that it could be one or one and a
 
03:31:37.269 --> 03:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
half ago okay got it thank you exactly
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry if i caused confusion
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
before about that because that's what
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's what they were saying is that you
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
know this is a floor and we compete with
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
each other so if those rates goes up
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to be competing for the
 
03:31:49.269 --> 03:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
consumers and so but if it goes down we
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
can't compete anymore we're out of it
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
we're out of the market right
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
exactly great okay now representative
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
mcelroy um i i i think there's a little
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
bit of uh
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
misleading information here if what a
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
current contract would say correct me if
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong
 
03:32:08.309 --> 03:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
is that the minimum that a client would
 
03:32:10.950 --> 03:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
ever get back would be one percent
 
03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
if somehow so they couldn't pay less
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
than one percent even if they were
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
earning less than one percent now we're
 
03:32:20.469 --> 03:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
putting that threshold down to 15 basis
 
03:32:20.479 --> 03:32:21.750 align:start position:0%
putting that threshold down to 15 basis
points

03:32:21.750 --> 03:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
what that also does is means that the
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
insurance company has to keep less
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
reserves which in fact would allow them
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
to credit a little bit of a higher
 
03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
interest rate on a fixed annuity so i
 
03:32:35.439 --> 03:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
interest rate on a fixed annuity so i
the

03:32:36.389 --> 03:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
chairman when you said that if they
 
03:32:39.910 --> 03:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
earned less than one percent they
 
03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
earned less than one percent they
wouldn't

03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
get it that's that's incorrect they
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
would they would get one percent
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
threshold now at 15 basis points i
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
suspect that in a year or two if
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
interest rates go up they'll come back
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
with that and and juice it up a little
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
bit i think dropping it to 15 basis
 
03:32:57.910 --> 03:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
points is a little a little excessive
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
but uh what do i know thank you
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay well that's a good point and i will
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
say this was uh the change at the neic
 
03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
was in 2020 so it's been out there for a
 
03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
little while and uh we haven't made the
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
change yet but we now saying okay we
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
need because
 
03:33:15.670 --> 03:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a small market
 
03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
and we would like to encourage like more
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
insurance products here and consumers to
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
have choice so we'd rather have
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
that competitive environment in new
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that for anybody that wants
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
these products they can have them
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
offered to them
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
but does the question why do we have
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
anything why don't we just say whatever
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
the product the company sells
 
03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
but you know if we have to keep
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
revisiting every time interest rates
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
yoyo why why why are we why are we in
 
03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
the business i assume this is nic model
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it just says it kind of begs the
 
03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
question why are we doing this when
 
03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's a free market out
 
03:33:52.399 --> 03:33:53.269 align:start position:0%
if it's a if it's a free market out
there

03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
and companies will be competing so why
 
03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
not just let them have have whatever
 
03:33:59.110 --> 03:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
they want to have
 
03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll have to check but i don't know
 
03:34:03.510 --> 03:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
that this model has changed uh
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
like was changing all was long until
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
2020 i'd have to look into that but it
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
might have just been the market was the
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
rate was depressed for so low the
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
industry was depressed for so long that
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
it motivated the neic to change to
 
03:34:18.309 --> 03:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
change it question mr sure yes
 
03:34:20.469 --> 03:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
representative so so uh to follow did
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
you in fact uh
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
see obser empirical evidence to the
 
03:34:27.269 --> 03:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
effect that insurers were no longer
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
issuing new
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
annuities in new hampshire because of
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
the low interest rates over the course
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the last year or two no did you see a
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
decrease because we're talking about
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
the availability of product and this
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
being effectively a barrier to the
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
providers because they don't want to
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the current floor of one percent so
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
what happened with to sales over the
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
course of the last two years
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
so for us
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
have no idea we don't we don't uh
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
collect data on sales we just know what
 
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
we hear from industry in the ndic as to
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
why this was problematic and at the neic
 
03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
just for everybody's benefit
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
that discussion includes both industry
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
and consumer advocacy groups and
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
regulators so it's a
 
03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
full panel type of discussion when they
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
go about changing a model law
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
it does not take a few weeks it takes
 
03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:23.990 align:start position:0%
it does not take a few weeks it takes
months

03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
so recommend mac leader you have a would
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
you believe i think i can answer his
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
question the the fact is that
 
03:35:30.479 --> 03:35:31.269 align:start position:0%
question the the fact is that
a

03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
fixed annuity which is simply a fixed
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
interest rate we promise you this for
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
sales of fixed annuities have gone down
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically what they've done is
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
they've replaced it with a product
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
called an indexed annuity which simply
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
says your interest is going to be based
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
on something such as the s p minus five
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
points or something like that so it's a
 
03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
different product has taken place thank
 
03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
different product has taken place thank
you

03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
it just does beg the question why are we
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
but we're not talking about the interest
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
rate being paid on the annuity we're
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the interest on the norn
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
forfeiture value the forfeiture and
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
what's left yes yes
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
and um marty mobley our legal
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator just pointed out to me the
 
03:36:14.960 --> 03:36:15.750 align:start position:0%
coordinator just pointed out to me the
actual

03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
actual
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
the last time this particular law was
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
changed here for us was 2004 you know
 
03:36:22.389 --> 03:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
for this particular so it's it's been a
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
while oh of course i remember that you
 
03:36:24.479 --> 03:36:25.190 align:start position:0%
while oh of course i remember that you
know

03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
this is 409 rsa 409 a colon 4. but
 
03:36:30.309 --> 03:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's that that's the law that we're
 
03:36:32.229 --> 03:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
trying to change here
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative johnson
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
um i understand why you're doing it
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
would it make more sense to
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
word it so that it's
 
03:36:45.429 --> 03:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
instead of having to keep revisiting us
 
03:36:47.910 --> 03:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
every what five or ten years to change
 
03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:48.950 align:start position:0%
every what five or ten years to change
the

03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
fix it so it's just
 
03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:52.790 align:start position:0%
fix it so it's just
x

03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
x
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
on the and
 
03:36:56.550 --> 03:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah like a formula
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
rather than just keep changing the rate
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
every five to ten years based on so this
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
is this is a question over her pay grade
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
okay and this goes back to nic models
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay and one of the one of my my floor
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
speeches when we talk about insurance is
 
03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
the one thing you want to do is not be
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
different than other states
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
that the more uniformity
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
conformity to uniformity
 
03:37:29.349 --> 03:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
gets you
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
more companies to do business in your
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
state because we're talking about
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
attracting somebody who's you know some
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
who knows know where they are but we
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
want them to do business in new
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire so if they know
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we got remember we get that aaa
 
03:37:45.190 --> 03:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
rating because we're right on the money
 
03:37:49.110 --> 03:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
with our nic model legislation then uh
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're more apt to do business in the
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
state and and i can respond to this in
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
another practical matter okay so the
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
idea of not being different so we
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
approve rates and forms at the
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
department and if a company has to ch
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
these are required provisions that have
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
to be in the contract if a company has
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
to change their
 
03:38:10.229 --> 03:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
terminology for new hampshire
 
03:38:12.150 --> 03:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
they're not going to bother there's not
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's not enough business to do that
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly thank you i appreciate
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
that help me understand it more thank
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%

03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%

hi good aft afternoon and thank you mr
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the uh
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
commerce committee
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
the commerce consumer affairs committee
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
i should say
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is peter teroshan
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
i represent rockingham county district
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
14 the towns of atkinson and plaistow
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
i come here today to ask you to consider
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass motion for house bill
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
1582 fn
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
this is an act repealing the granite
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
state family leave plan
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that this act goes against the
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
granite state way
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
it will be very cost costly and this
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
is not the time to add this kind of
 
04:03:19.920 --> 04:03:21.830 align:start position:0%
is not the time to add this kind of
entitlement

04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
entitlement
 
04:03:24.150 --> 04:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
it is already difficult for employer
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
employers in the state to find employees
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
in this current environment we find
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves in
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
there are already insurance plans
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
available that won't cost the state
 
04:03:38.160 --> 04:03:39.670 align:start position:0%
available that won't cost the state
taxpayers

04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:03:43.510 --> 04:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
many impr many private employers
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
add this benefit if their employers
 
04:03:47.120 --> 04:03:48.229 align:start position:0%
add this benefit if their employers
employees

04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:03:50.150 --> 04:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
request it so in other words if there's
 
04:03:51.910 --> 04:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
a need for it
 
04:03:53.830 --> 04:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
private business
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
will consider it
 
04:03:56.950 --> 04:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
however this plan
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
only adds the benefit to state
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go over some of the the uh
 
04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns i have some of the points
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
this program costs taxpayers
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
real money it's not you know it comes
 
04:04:17.830 --> 04:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
out of the taxpayers
 
04:04:17.840 --> 04:04:19.189 align:start position:0%
out of the taxpayers
fmli

04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
fmli
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
is bad policy that's getting uh
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know has been put into the rsas and
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it should be done that way
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that state government
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
should be in the business of adding this
 
04:04:28.880 --> 04:04:33.030 align:start position:0%
should be in the business of adding this
entitlement

04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.630 --> 04:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe it will cost more than
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
what they've projected but looking at
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the initial numbers
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
family medical leave act has been
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
promoted as a voluntary program
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
but in fact it would co would again use
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money without even requiring it
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
being negotiated on behalf of the
 
04:04:53.189 --> 04:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
employees that will receive it
 
04:04:54.150 --> 04:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
this will
 
04:04:55.830 --> 04:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
create a chain reaction where other
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
employee groups
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
will ask to be put on the program
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
in in increasing and bloating the cost
 
04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh to run the program
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
this creates a new state
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
department as you as you've probably
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
seen if you looked at the bill
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
that will oversee
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
this will very likely lead to an income
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.920 --> 04:05:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
in

04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:05:28.800 --> 04:05:29.590 align:start position:0%
in
in

04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:05:31.349 --> 04:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
one other point very important point
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill never had a hearing the bill
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
was this this
 
04:05:35.840 --> 04:05:37.189 align:start position:0%
was this this
um

04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:40.150 --> 04:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill was put into the budget
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so it never had a hearing i think
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh entitlement program of this size and
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
significance should have a hearing
 
04:05:49.510 --> 04:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislators members of the public
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
can weigh in
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the program that never happened
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons and more i ask
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
you to consider
 
04:06:01.269 --> 04:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
to to pass this bill so we can repeal
 
04:06:04.000 --> 04:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
to to pass this bill so we can repeal
the

04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
the family medical leave
 
04:06:09.670 --> 04:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
plan and with that i would take any
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members may
 
04:06:11.040 --> 04:06:12.790 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members may
have

04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
represented bartlett has a question
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
um you seem to know how much this is
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
going to cost how much is it going to
 
04:06:19.439 --> 04:06:20.229 align:start position:0%
going to cost how much is it going to
cost

04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is the rfp
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
isn't due until march
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's true we don't know that and if
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
you look at in that's if you look at the
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's what they talk about
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the very fact we don't know what's
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to cost is another point that i
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
didn't uh bring up but i will now
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's concerning to me that we we pass or
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
put in the legislation something that we
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
don't even know what's going to what the
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
final bill is going to be
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
so the reason i i believe it's going to
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
cost more than what was projected i
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
could get you a number if you like i
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't have one with me today oh so
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're an insurance agent no
 
04:06:56.000 --> 04:06:57.110 align:start position:0%
you're an insurance agent no
no

04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:06:57.120 --> 04:06:57.830 align:start position:0%
no
but

04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
there have been projections done on this
 
04:06:59.760 --> 04:07:00.870 align:start position:0%
there have been projections done on this
and

04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i indicated my remarks i believe
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost more than what was
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
what people were anticipating because of
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
more employees are probably going to
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
demand this
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
at the state level hence
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
adding cost to it also i'd like to point
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
out in the fiscal note if we repeal this
 
04:07:18.880 --> 04:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
out in the fiscal note if we repeal this
act

04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
act
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
the money that that's being put into
 
04:07:23.429 --> 04:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
this program to implement it and to fund
 
04:07:23.439 --> 04:07:24.389 align:start position:0%
this program to implement it and to fund
it

04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh the insurance premiums uh would go
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
back um according to what it says in the
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it would it end up in the
 
04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
education fund so that money could be
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
used in better ways than than doing this
 
04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
04:07:42.560 --> 04:07:44.550 align:start position:0%
for the question
so

04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
um i have just to be clear you don't
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
know how much it's going to cost it is a
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
voluntary program um so people that
 
04:07:51.359 --> 04:07:52.149 align:start position:0%
voluntary program um so people that
don't

04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to be to participate in it don't
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
have to participate in it
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
but you still want to repeal it because
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
because you think this money
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
somehow would go into the education
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
program which education program i'd be
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
glad to read you the um
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's necessary so if i
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
re if i'm reading this thing correctly
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
it it appears the money the money is
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
initially from the
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that if the
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you're not funding if i'm reading
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
this correctly if they're not funding it
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
then the money would go back to
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund which is where the
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
premium tax is but but it also mentions
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:08:33.920 --> 04:08:36.149 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
education fund so i'm not sure exactly
 
04:08:40.149 --> 04:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
what's the division there in terms of
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
how how that
 
04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
money but theoretically
 
04:08:47.110 --> 04:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the monies is the premium it's the
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
premium taxes where the money that seems
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is you
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
said that it sounded definitively that
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
this program will lead to an income tax
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
and um i wonder
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
how how you came to that given that we
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what the cost is or where
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
your data would come from
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative so what i said is likely
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
lead to an income tax and the reason i
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
said that is because when i look at the
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
cost that other states uh have incurred
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
doing this it's a it's a program that
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
usually grows
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
um quickly
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
know and have family members that work
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
for for private companies that have a
 
04:09:34.229 --> 04:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
similar program
 
04:09:34.239 --> 04:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
similar program
and

04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
the reason why it generally
 
04:09:40.149 --> 04:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
grows in cost is because in many cases
 
04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
when somebody goes out on a family
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
medical leave type
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
paid leave
 
04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
the oftentimes they stay longer than
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
they they anticipate and many
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
employers have indicated
 
04:09:53.680 --> 04:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
employers have indicated
that

04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes hard to get people back
 
04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
to work in the time frame they expected
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case and again i'm only
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
going on what um you know i've seen and
 
04:10:04.640 --> 04:10:05.510 align:start position:0%
going on what um you know i've seen and
heard

04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
with other states that have implemented
 
04:10:08.309 --> 04:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
this and with private businesses that
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
have done it that it could very likely
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh if it grows in size lead to an income
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
tax that's that's a concern
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is have you have you have
 
04:10:22.710 --> 04:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
do you have documentation of
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
increases in income tax
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:30.149 --> 04:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
well only that the
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
so the other states that i'm aware of
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
that have implemented already have an
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
income tax so it didn't add an income
 
04:10:35.359 --> 04:10:36.389 align:start position:0%
income tax so it didn't add an income
tax

04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
however um the cost of the program has
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
grown and if it's not funded other ways
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
that could lead i'm speculating could
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
lead to an income tax
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative mcaleer
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but i thought
 
04:10:53.910 --> 04:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
the only funding that the state would uh
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
be involved in is the administration of
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
the plan and even that could be passed
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
off to a
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
to some private insurance company so i i
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
guess i don't understand
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
why you're saying the cost of this is
 
04:11:07.510 --> 04:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to arise because the premiums are
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
paid by the
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's true however you know and i'm not
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the insurance company i know some of
 
04:11:18.149 --> 04:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
you in here are
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
if the if the program
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh grows
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
bigger than what
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
the initial projection was in other
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
words right now the way i understand
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to affect 11 000
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
give or take
 
04:11:30.319 --> 04:11:31.510 align:start position:0%
give or take
employees

04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
04:11:35.110 --> 04:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
given to
 
04:11:35.120 --> 04:11:35.990 align:start position:0%
given to
other

04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
state employees that number could could
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
go up substantially
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know if the program's implemented
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
the number of people that use it and go
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
out on medical leave that will add
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
the potential premium costs to go up
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
because of um
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
based on employers i've talked to their
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
costs have risen over the years because
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
again people are using the program
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's great but oftentimes they stay
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
out perhaps a little longer than it is
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
anticipated and that you know insurance
 
04:12:10.950 --> 04:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
companies are in the business of losing
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
money they have to fund it somehow
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire uh
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
if if a private employer has this and if
 
04:12:23.349 --> 04:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
the private employer is paying for it i
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
can see that that the cost might go up
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
and affect the employer but in the case
 
04:12:30.550 --> 04:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the costs could go
 
04:12:32.950 --> 04:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
through the roof and if long as this
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
program is voluntary the uh state
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
employee can either opt in or opt out so
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect the state at all and
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
you run something like this digitally
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's 11 000
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
participants or 20 000 participants it's
 
04:12:52.870 --> 04:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
not double the cost it's it's a minimal
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
cost to to add additional people because
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're paying the premium all the state
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
is doing is administrating the plan
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
and do you have any estimates of what
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
the planned administration cost would be
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
i don't perhaps somebody else testifying
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
after me may have those numbers i only
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
know that the um
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
again looking at other places where this
 
04:13:17.110 --> 04:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
is done oftentimes the number
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
of people
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
requesting or demanding that the uh
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
the program goes up
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
so let me let me know um
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
this committee actually did hear the
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
family leave statute the bill
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh obviously this one is different than
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
than what we heard the one we heard was
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
going to be mandatory
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
to employers and that's why it was uh
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
accused of being an income tax because
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
the employers had to do it
 
04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
in my understanding there and again i'm
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
reading all this for the first time and
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know we'll have a subcommittee to
 
04:13:53.110 --> 04:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
work through this but
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding the initial money
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
was to get the program off the ground
 
04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that it would the money would be
 
04:14:01.040 --> 04:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
and that it would the money would be
returned

04:14:02.790 --> 04:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
returned
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
once the the fund the program got going
 
04:14:06.800 --> 04:14:07.590 align:start position:0%
once the the fund the program got going
now

04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
under that assumption was that uh that
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
in this case that the the state is
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
adding some employees so they're giving
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
some critical mass but at the end of the
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
day the program theoretically
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
would be uh was paid you know whether
 
04:14:24.229 --> 04:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
the employer had the choice so whether
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted to take the full amount of
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
money out of the paycheck or cover it
 
04:14:27.760 --> 04:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
money out of the paycheck or cover it
themselves

04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
but in terms of what the state of new
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire would do is yes it would be
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the full cost or whatever the employee
 
04:14:37.110 --> 04:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
is because we would have to renegotiate
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
our contract with the state employees so
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
at this point there is some cost related
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
to the state to
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
have the state employees participate but
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the initial monies
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
was really just to get the program off
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
the ground and there would be a separate
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh insurance and that's what the world's
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
going out to bid right now is the uh who
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
is going to be the administrator of the
 
04:15:00.309 --> 04:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
program and obviously they're going to
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
want to cut but they're the ones who are
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to make sure manage the money
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
manage that the money the amount of
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
money that actually pays out is relative
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
to how much is getting paid in and
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
plus getting paid their fee
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
with the expectation at some point in
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
time the state would be refunded for
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
what our initial costs to get the
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
program off the ground
 
04:15:20.319 --> 04:15:21.349 align:start position:0%
program off the ground
but

04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
but it's uh it's also my um
 
04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that the
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
the there's a new state
 
04:15:29.040 --> 04:15:30.389 align:start position:0%
the there's a new state
agency

04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
or you know employees have been added to
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely through the
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
department of labor uh and and the way
 
04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
we were way way they showed it to us was
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
was the unemployment excuse me and the
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
way we the way they showed it to us is
 
04:15:44.479 --> 04:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
way we the way they showed it to us is
that

04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
their the scheme and i'll use the word
 
04:15:49.359 --> 04:15:50.229 align:start position:0%
their the scheme and i'll use the word
scheme

04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
scheme
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
was that just like an employer
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
pays the
 
04:15:55.279 --> 04:15:56.630 align:start position:0%
pays the
unemployment

04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
04:15:58.950 --> 04:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
for their employees there would be there
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
would be another field in that form the
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment form and that would be uh
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
allocation for payroll for this for this
 
04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
fund so
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
it would be administrated through the
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
state through uh employment security and
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's obviously there's going to be a
 
04:16:13.680 --> 04:16:14.389 align:start position:0%
that's obviously there's going to be a
cost

04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
to the employment security to to make
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
that operate but right now employment
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
security is funded through
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
that what we charge uh you know
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax now so and say in terms
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
of where where's the impact of the
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
general fund the impact of the general
 
04:16:32.070 --> 04:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
fund is we're taking money out of the
 
04:16:34.630 --> 04:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
general fund now or education general
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
fund that normally would go there from
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
the premium tax
 
04:16:40.229 --> 04:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax so that's
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
where the source where the money
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
followed the trail of the money but that
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
um if i'm reading this correctly again i
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't know but but it but yes it would
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
create a new department a person in the
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
department and that fees
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
the whole argument around was
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that any insurance company
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
would operate which is the payout can't
 
04:17:00.399 --> 04:17:01.189 align:start position:0%
would operate which is the payout can't
be

04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
greater than how much money they're able
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
to collect
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
through the fees and collecting the fees
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
for whatever is assessment paid
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative johnson do you have a
 
04:17:16.960 --> 04:17:19.269 align:start position:0%
representative johnson do you have a
question

04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
as you just explained to chairman hunt
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully if i get this right so
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
if the funds started going growing
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
higher than what we already took out of
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers we would then have another
 
04:17:38.070 --> 04:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
line that employee employers would now
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
have to pay
 
04:17:42.870 --> 04:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
to offer the state employee
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
this fund because we would have to you
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
would have it as a like you said the
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax there would be another
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
line of tax at employers or
 
04:17:55.110 --> 04:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
private employees would have to pay on
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
through unemployment
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
so basically you're saying another tax
 
04:17:58.479 --> 04:17:59.429 align:start position:0%
so basically you're saying another tax
for

04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
residents of new hampshire
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
in in a roundabout way yes okay so it is
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
a tax
 
04:18:08.550 --> 04:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
it would absolutely be a tax
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh the way it was supposed to be
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
considered now obviously it was
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
different the bill we had was all
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
employers had to participate in it
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
but which then that's why we labeled it
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
at income tax
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
but because it's on income payroll on
 
04:18:25.110 --> 04:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
payroll income
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
the issue would be that if this is
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary that the employer chooses to
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
that yes that employer will that all
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
employers who are participating in the
 
04:18:35.439 --> 04:18:37.030 align:start position:0%
employers who are participating in the
program

04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
would have to pay more if the if there
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
were too much claims to it
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state employees portion which i
 
04:18:46.469 --> 04:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
obviously um i i don't know anything
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
about that because that was not in the
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill that we had
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that the state
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
employees actually
 
04:18:59.110 --> 04:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a family leave type program now
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
and so that the monies were supposed to
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
be really what we're spending now in
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
what they're already offering but i do
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
not know that for a fact okay so i don't
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
know obviously we need to learn more
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
whether that's true or not but at the
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
end of the day i i would say the the
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental question is is if if the
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill says today
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
that any employer may join it if the
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
the fear is that suddenly we all were
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
not here anymore and there was somebody
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
else in charge of our legislature and
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
our governor and they decided to make it
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
a shall
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
like the original plan was
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
then they would that we have facilitated
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
that from happening theoretically they
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
could do that anyways even if we hadn't
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
created this model ahead of time
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
mr chair with your indulgence could i
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
just add a point based on what
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
the conversation is
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
and that is there are many people that
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
have questions and
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
and there's some uncertainty to
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
the costs in in this program so
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
that lends
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
to the idea that
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
if we repeal this and somebody wanted to
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
bring it back then we could have a
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
hearing on the bill
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
and and have these details worked out
 
04:20:17.110 --> 04:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
before you pass the bill which is you
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
know with this one it's kind of put in
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
the car before the horse we have all
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
these uncertainties and my experience
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
has been um
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
particularly with with government
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
agencies that if
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
you don't know the number chances are
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
the numbers you know over time is going
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
to grow and and that's my concern
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't get a public hearing on this
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
it was put into the budget and these
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
many people would like i think to know
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
more on the details so this is one way
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
we could get there we could repeal it
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then you know if somebody wants to
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
bring a bill forward and have a hearing
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
on it and then hopefully those details
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
would come out uh
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
much more precisely thank you i will
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
hope with the next month we'll learn all
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
we need to know that's true
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative bootleg thank you mr
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:21:01.520 --> 04:21:03.030 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
um

04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
so this bill was passed and signed by
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
so he
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
supports granite state paid family leave
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
plan obviously
 
04:21:14.319 --> 04:21:15.269 align:start position:0%
plan obviously
so

04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i believe this is do you believe
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
that this is good for families and
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
in in the state of new hampshire and
 
04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
just um really just answer that you know
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
if the governor supports this
 
04:21:28.800 --> 04:21:29.670 align:start position:0%
if the governor supports this
and

04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're the party of the governor
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
why would you go against the governors
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know where you're going
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
with this now no i'm just saying the
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
governor the governor we're forgetting
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
about the governor
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
your question was don't you think this
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
is a good thing for families
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
that was the first but i also wanted to
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
remind him that the governor did sign
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:21:53.110 --> 04:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay that but that's not really
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate question we don't talk about
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
people's motives
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
so um just um explain to me
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
do you think your constituents um um
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
like this bill the family leave plan
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
in all honesty i haven't had any
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
constituents tell me they do like the
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
program um
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
04:22:14.640 --> 04:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
and you know
either

04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
is there some merit to having a plan
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
where you go to family leave for various
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
items yes
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
but again i have a
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
an acquaintance that works for insurance
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
company in massachusetts that company
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
enacted and provided
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
a family medical leave program that they
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
fund i i'm assuming through insurance i
 
04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't really know but one of in this
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
particular individual is in management
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
down there one of the problems they have
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
is when people go out on a legitimate
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
reason oftentimes the it's very
 
04:22:48.000 --> 04:22:49.110 align:start position:0%
reason oftentimes the it's very
difficult

04:22:49.110 --> 04:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
to get them to come back to work while
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
the while the benefits being paid in the
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
crisis has
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um subsided then it's it's oftentimes
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to get people back another way
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
i would answer the question is
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
this there's many companies and i think
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
government agencies that when you have a
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
problem at home they are sympathetic to
 
04:23:10.229 --> 04:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
that and there's ways to do it without
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know in a short period of time i'm
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
not talking months and months
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
to help that employee out without having
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative johnson so isn't it true
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
that you can already buy a
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
plan similar to this privately any
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
individual you can go out to an
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
aflac is a is a perfect example because
 
04:23:38.319 --> 04:23:39.349 align:start position:0%
aflac is a is a perfect example because
your

04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:23:39.359 --> 04:23:40.389 align:start position:0%
your
physical

04:23:40.389 --> 04:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
physical
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
ailments this this is
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
giving you money to stay home take care
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
of somebody
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe they have a plan like that
 
04:23:49.520 --> 04:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
i do believe they have a plan like that
too

04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
what so it's mine so i think what you're
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
referring to representative and thanks
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
for the question is that there are
 
04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
programs um
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
various catastrophic uh programs for
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
people but
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's also uh from what i've read there
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
are programs that businesses use to you
 
04:24:08.149 --> 04:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
know they fund this partially through
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
insurance so it's my understanding there
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
is is some availability of coverages
 
04:24:12.560 --> 04:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
is is some availability of coverages
there

04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
afflack will cover you for you as an
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
individual if you have to stay home and
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
have to leave work but aflac does not
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
have a program for family
 
04:24:22.560 --> 04:24:23.349 align:start position:0%
have a program for family
or

04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know affiliates
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
so you're the only ty it's helping you
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
out that flick is for you but not for
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you're at home taking care of a sick
 
04:24:31.760 --> 04:24:33.429 align:start position:0%
if you're at home taking care of a sick
kid

04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
kid
 
04:24:33.439 --> 04:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
kid
so

04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:36.309 --> 04:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat unique
 
04:24:36.319 --> 04:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
it is somewhat unique
but

04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay the chair will call on
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
so you just you already got boned up on
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%

04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill than we do
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%

labor committee finance two
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting and i'm also a senior
 
04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
advisor in the house majority office
 
04:25:27.670 --> 04:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
most importantly is
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
i've had
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of experience with these these
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
bills uh back when i was in the house my
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
last term
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh that was when senator feltus tried to
 
04:25:39.269 --> 04:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
put through a
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill that would have mandated a as you
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
said before a tax of a half percent
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh on the entire every everybody in the
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire i was the point
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
man on our committee on that i worked
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
with the department
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
on those uh those issues and the numbers
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
so very familiar there on this
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
particular issue i'm also very familiar
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
because i served on finance 2 which was
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
i'll get into a little bit more of the
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
history of why we are where we are and
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
finance 2
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
was involved
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
with this and then i ended up on the
 
04:26:20.229 --> 04:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee of conference for hb2
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
where this
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
was the fine one of the two final issues
 
04:26:28.149 --> 04:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
so first thing i want to talk about is
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
when this was discussed by the promoters
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh governor sununu he sent it over in
 
04:26:32.720 --> 04:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
uh governor sununu he sent it over in
hb2

04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
it was sold as a voluntary and a private
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
insurance plan and that is
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
not true it's partially true but not
 
04:26:41.040 --> 04:26:42.630 align:start position:0%
not true it's partially true but not
true

04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
for the 10 11 000 state employees
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
employees would be
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
given this program
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
cost free
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
without the need to negotiate the
 
04:26:52.720 --> 04:26:53.830 align:start position:0%
without the need to negotiate the
benefit

04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
now and later on we can talk about
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
numbers and what the potential cost is
 
04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
on that but ten thousand eleven thousand
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
state employees would get this at the
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
for free at the uh on the backs of the
 
04:27:04.960 --> 04:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
for free at the uh on the backs of the
taxpayers

04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
so what's going to happen
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
after that the the idea was to make this
 
04:27:15.429 --> 04:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
a private insurance plan that other
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
employees in the state would use well
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
let's go through this logically and see
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen number one
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
plans like this are extremely expensive
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
we don't know we passed this through the
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
house without ever knowing what the bill
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
to fund the eleven thousand state
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
employees a year it's going to be a huge
 
04:27:37.510 --> 04:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
figure and we'll talk about that to the
 
04:27:37.520 --> 04:27:38.710 align:start position:0%
figure and we'll talk about that to the
end

04:27:38.710 --> 04:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
end
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
but private employers
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
are not going to use this program
 
04:27:43.670 --> 04:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
they're simply not going to use it
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be too too
 
04:27:44.960 --> 04:27:46.070 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be too too
expensive

04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
and again we'll talk about the costs
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit later
 
04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
so what's going to end up happening
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
is it's going to end up being a
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
entitlement program for the state
 
04:27:57.439 --> 04:27:58.469 align:start position:0%
entitlement program for the state
workers

04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
11 000 of them
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
after that
 
04:28:04.630 --> 04:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
when no private individuals get involved
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
with the system
 
04:28:06.319 --> 04:28:07.189 align:start position:0%
with the system
then

04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
public sectors are going to be coming to
 
04:28:14.229 --> 04:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
the state or to their local school
 
04:28:17.110 --> 04:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
boards towns say hey state employees are
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
getting this paid for on their tax
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
dollars why aren't we getting it so it's
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to turn into a
 
04:28:23.120 --> 04:28:24.309 align:start position:0%
going to turn into a
program

04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
for for the benefit of the public public
 
04:28:26.479 --> 04:28:28.389 align:start position:0%
for for the benefit of the public public
sector

04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
sector
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
private employee employers are not going
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
and of course once it
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
becomes law and it's finalized of course
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislate this legislative will to
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
eliminate it at that point it's going to
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
be too late
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about where we are in the
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
program right now right now um
 
04:28:49.680 --> 04:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
program right now right now um
the

04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
executive committee just approved 1.9
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
to give to a company to go out and look
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
for bids
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
and implement the system 1.9 million
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's just to get the program up and
 
04:29:07.359 --> 04:29:11.429 align:start position:0%
that's just to get the program up and
started

04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
the plan itself won't go into effect if
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
it goes into effect until the very end
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
so now let's i'll hit a few general
 
04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
points and then we'll get into a little
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
program like this
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
strictly incentivizes people
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
really to take advantage of the program
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
and if you remember back
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
or you may not remember back but when
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
the issue came up uh senator feltus's
 
04:29:43.120 --> 04:29:44.870 align:start position:0%
the issue came up uh senator feltus's
bill

04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
the only way to make an fmli
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
plan like this
 
04:29:48.800 --> 04:29:49.830 align:start position:0%
plan like this
work

04:29:49.830 --> 04:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to call it work making it
 
04:29:51.920 --> 04:29:52.950 align:start position:0%
if you want to call it work making it
work

04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
is to force everybody into it with a tax
 
04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot do an opt-in system and when
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
we had the senate senator feltes plan
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
last time
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
once it was determined that there was no
 
04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
way we were going to make a
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
a mandatory program for every employee
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:30:13.110 --> 04:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
they attempted to bring it back to an
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt-out that just makes a plan
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
even more unsustainable than it uh it
 
04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
would be under uh forcing so it just
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:24.239 --> 04:30:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
interesting point i mean have we learned
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
nothing during the last couple of years
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
when you pay people to stay home and
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
work it doesn't incentivize to work why
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
would a private employer now get into a
 
04:30:34.319 --> 04:30:35.830 align:start position:0%
would a private employer now get into a
program

04:30:35.830 --> 04:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to incentivize his
 
04:30:37.680 --> 04:30:39.429 align:start position:0%
that's going to incentivize his
individuals

04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity give the opportunity to
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
not work and get paid when they can't
 
04:30:46.469 --> 04:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
find employees now that's another reason
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
why private employers are just not going
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
to go along with this
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
um a lot of companies offer some form of
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
a paid leave now or a combination of
 
04:30:57.189 --> 04:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
personal day sick days vacation days
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
they roll them all into one basket and
 
04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know they give the individuals that
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
time now
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
and the companies that do that and we've
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
had them testify before labor they do it
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
because it they they believe it helps
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
them sometimes to retain and hire the
 
04:31:10.640 --> 04:31:12.469 align:start position:0%
them sometimes to retain and hire the
employees

04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
by giving them that that kind of a
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
basket of days days off
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
another way that individuals could
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
take advantage of a
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
paid time off because
 
04:31:26.790 --> 04:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
requires an employer to allow an
 
04:31:31.990 --> 04:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
individual to have time off through
 
04:31:35.110 --> 04:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
family leave it's unpaid in most places
 
04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
but there's a requirement so there's
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevents an
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
individual and i had i don't have them
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
with me but i had calculated one time
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
how little money it would take for an
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
individual to put aside each month to
 
04:31:46.080 --> 04:31:49.110 align:start position:0%
individual to put aside each month to
actually

04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
pay for a self-insured benefit at some
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
point should they need
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
to take time off to care for
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
under the family medical leave plan
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
as i said before private insurance plans
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:08.550 --> 04:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
and as i also said before the only way
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
to make it work is to force people uh
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
into it when we were talking about the
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh senator feltz's plan before
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
um when they had uh nixed the idea of
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to a mandatory
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.199 --> 04:32:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
tax

04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
and they went to an opt-in
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
give you an example of
 
04:32:32.790 --> 04:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
why an opt-in system
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't work properly timed if an
 
04:32:35.600 --> 04:32:36.710 align:start position:0%
doesn't work properly timed if an
employee

04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
could opt into a system
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
pay two hundred fifty dollars in
 
04:32:40.239 --> 04:32:41.510 align:start position:0%
pay two hundred fifty dollars in
premiums

04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
and take out a five thousand dollar
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
event benefit the following year
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's why an opt-in opt-in
 
04:32:47.760 --> 04:32:48.870 align:start position:0%
that's why an opt-in opt-in
opt-in

04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
system just
 
04:32:53.110 --> 04:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
now let's talk about the states that
 
04:32:54.800 --> 04:32:55.590 align:start position:0%
now let's talk about the states that
have

04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%

04:33:08.629 --> 04:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
are those really the states that we want
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
to emulate these are the states not only
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
that have some of the highest tax rates
 
04:33:15.269 --> 04:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
in the country but these are the states
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
that people are

uh
 
04:33:23.840 --> 04:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
uh
states

04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know when we
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
there were
 
04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
matter of fact in the preamble to the
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 language they talk about uh
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
they believe that this is a way to in
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know get people to come to the state
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
work for us and this and that
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
people don't come to the state because
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
you've got a fmli plan they go to the
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
states where there's low tax and you can
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
you know you can do well and not be
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about how we got to where
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
okay hb2 when governor sent it over to
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
us last year included
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
in the house we
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
worked extremely hard to get it removed
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
from hb2
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
because we knew if we couldn't get it
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
out of hb2
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
it would not a budget would have not
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
come out of the house this year
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
and after a bunch of work
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
several of us were
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
able to get it removed
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
and we finally passed a budget and went
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
over to the senate
 
04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
i'll just say there was pressure on them
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
to put
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
and at the very end of the process
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the committee conference
 
04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get into the gory
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
details but it did end up
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:02.240 --> 04:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't know a lot about
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
this plan
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
i bet you most of you don't know a lot
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
about this plan and the reason you don't
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
know about it because
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
nobody promoted it
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
why didn't
 
04:35:17.189 --> 04:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
anybody promote it i heard this
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative here talk about before
 
04:35:19.439 --> 04:35:20.310 align:start position:0%
representative here talk about before
about

04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
governor sununu and his influence
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
but the reason it wasn't
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
promoted because it's a horrible program
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
right after the budget was passed and
 
04:35:30.719 --> 04:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
right after the budget was passed and
signed

04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
signed
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
i was at several meetings where
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
the executive governor
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
04:35:39.600 --> 04:35:41.109 align:start position:0%
the senate
president

04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
president
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:35:44.551 --> 04:35:44.561 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
spoke about all the glory of the hb2
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
issues that we had passed and not once
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
was fmli
 
04:35:51.600 --> 04:35:52.789 align:start position:0%
was fmli
mentioned

04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's because it's a bad issue it's a bad
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
campaigning issue
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not a
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
i was in a labor committee hearing
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
earlier and nobody testified nobody was
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
there from anybody's office to back it
 
04:36:10.639 --> 04:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
there from anybody's office to back it
up

04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
there's nobody here from any of the
 
04:36:14.869 --> 04:36:14.879 align:start position:0%
branches that i just mentioned
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
to back it up that's because it's a bad
 
04:36:18.240 --> 04:36:27.670 align:start position:0%
to back it up that's because it's a bad
policy

04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal points financial points i heard
 
04:36:32.789 --> 04:36:32.799 align:start position:0%
several people asking about
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
how much this would cost
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
now i'm not going to give you exact
 
04:36:38.240 --> 04:36:39.269 align:start position:0%
now i'm not going to give you exact
numbers

04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
because it's based on a lot of variables
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
a lot of these variables i worked with
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner when senator
 
04:36:47.910 --> 04:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
felsice's plan was here and it takes a
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
lot there's a lot of things involved
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
i will say that during our last
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
few years back
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
we had a firefighter testify that he
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
carried private insurance that was cover
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
very similar um
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
lengths of time and under certain
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances actually there were a
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
little less and at that time he was
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
paying 60 a week
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
for his plan 240 bucks a month
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
the numbers that
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
are shown in here in the hb2
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
five dollars a week something like that
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's insane there's no way that's going
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
so what kind of numbers are we looking
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
at do you think for just to pay for the
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
11 000 state employees
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
that's based on what they call an uptake
 
04:37:35.039 --> 04:37:36.230 align:start position:0%
that's based on what they call an uptake
rate

04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to use it
 
04:37:39.990 --> 04:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know that number
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
you'll hear the the actuaries they'll
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
say anywhere from four eight as high as
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
ten percent and when you start talking
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
those numbers i'll just throw out a
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
couple ones for you to consider
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
just to pay for those
 
04:37:51.680 --> 04:37:53.029 align:start position:0%
just to pay for those
uh

04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
eleven thousand state
 
04:37:58.949 --> 04:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
without considering the fact that once
 
04:38:00.709 --> 04:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
eight percent of those employees take
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
the the leave
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
how are you going to cover that lost
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
time you're going to cover that lost
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
time with overtime are you going to have
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
to carry extra employees
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
i mean those are all kinds of numbers
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
you gotta figure in and
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
this says nothing about them
 
04:38:15.840 --> 04:38:17.990 align:start position:0%
this says nothing about them
nothing

04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
an eight percent uptake ten percent
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
uptake you're talking somewhere between
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
nine and twelve million dollars a year
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
just for those ten to eleven thousand
 
04:38:27.680 --> 04:38:29.429 align:start position:0%
just for those ten to eleven thousand
employees

04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
so this is not an insignif insignificant
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh plan
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
not a total voluntary plan
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers are picking up the tab for
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
the eleven thousand
 
04:38:44.629 --> 04:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
so with that i will be happy to
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
and i do rise in support
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you uh thanks
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions i i guess i'm
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
totally confused because i understood
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
that the only bill that sununu would
 
04:39:02.949 --> 04:39:02.959 align:start position:0%
pass was a voluntary bill which by the
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
way i agree with you that that's never
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
gonna work but i thought that that's
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is and you're telling
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
me it's not and yet sununu said the only
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
thing he would pass
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
would not be a compulsory mandatory uh
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
but totally voluntary so i'm wrong is
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're partially wrong correct um 11 000
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
state employees will get this as a paid
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayer benefit period
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
then they opened it up for voluntary
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
to private businesses and actually you
 
04:39:38.868 --> 04:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
could be voluntary for other public
 
04:39:38.878 --> 04:39:39.830 align:start position:0%
could be voluntary for other public
sectors

04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
sectors
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
but then it becomes uh voluntary for
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
private businesses what i'm telling you
 
04:39:48.390 --> 04:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
is when you consider the costs involved
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
private businesses are not going to do
 
04:39:50.160 --> 04:39:51.110 align:start position:0%
private businesses are not going to do
this

04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's just too too expensive
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
so basically what it ends up being is
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
simply a
 
04:40:00.628 --> 04:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
as of now when it goes into effect it'll
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
be a taxpayer paid benefit for 11 000
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
state workers period
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:40:12.798 --> 04:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
members

04:40:13.750 --> 04:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd just like to ask you it's and
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is a a what-if scenario okay
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
we let's say we have a state worker
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
single mom
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
has has children one of the children
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
becomes very sick and the mom needs to
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
be with that child um why wouldn't they
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
be motivated to go back to work if
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're a single parent and they need to
 
04:40:38.550 --> 04:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
feed their family and um what would the
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
impact be on the state
 
04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
if we had people who needed to care for
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
sick and dying family members
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
what would that do to the management and
 
04:40:50.550 --> 04:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
running of the state
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for that i'm not
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.000 --> 04:40:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
they have one other card uh amanda sears
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
campaign for family
 
04:41:11.190 --> 04:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
friendly economy
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
now you don't write whether you support
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
her against the bill
 
04:41:15.360 --> 04:41:19.750 align:start position:0%
her against the bill
okay

04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
okay so you need to push the button
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
and keep that thing close to you okay
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
my name is amanda sears i'm the director
 
04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
of the campaign for family friendly
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
economy and i thank you for the time i
 
04:41:35.910 --> 04:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
can answer a lot of the questions you
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
were asking earlier and clear up a bunch
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:41:39.440 --> 04:41:40.390 align:start position:0%
of the
misconceptions

04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
misconceptions
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
between what the program you heard
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
before and this program they're very
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
different and so i'd be happy to do that
 
04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
i also did prepare things that i wanted
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
to say that will take my three minutes i
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
told you about so if i'm able to answer
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
your questions later about that or clear
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
those things up i'd really be happy to
 
04:41:56.798 --> 04:41:57.830 align:start position:0%
those things up i'd really be happy to
okay

04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
i do want to say um you know i come at
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
this from a very different perspective
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
than the couple of speakers before me um
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know paid family and medical leave
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
is a very important for workers and
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
businesses and the economy and the
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic has only underscored the value
 
04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
of having a system for ensuring that
 
04:42:18.150 --> 04:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
people can take the time they need for
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
medical emergencies without putting
 
04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
their financial security at risk but the
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
governor's program that is now the the
 
04:42:24.480 --> 04:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
governor's program that is now the the
policy

04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
would artificially prop up a private
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
insurance provider and it is not an
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
effective paid leave program that meets
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
the needs of granite staters
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
what the legislature should do is repeal
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
this program and replace it with one
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
that covers all working people so that's
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
why my position was not like an easy
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
check mark there um and we would be in
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
support of an amended version of this
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill that would repeal it and replace
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
the program that's currently in statute
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
the the previous speakers were right
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
there were no public hearings um
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding passage of this program and
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
that means that there has been no due
 
04:42:59.910 --> 04:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
diligence to solve the many many
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
problems and unknowns that exist with
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:43:06.788 --> 04:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
like access cost implications etc and
 
04:43:08.230 --> 04:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
those things should be considered to
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
build a program that would work
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
this program entirely leaves out a path
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
for employees of employers with under 50
 
04:43:15.840 --> 04:43:16.868 align:start position:0%
for employees of employers with under 50
people

04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
if i could back up and just describe um
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
if i would have a couple more a little
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
bit extra time than the three minutes
 
04:43:24.628 --> 04:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
there's three different pieces of this
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
program one is the state employees
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
coverage that would be done through a
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
contract with the state
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
to a private insurer to fund the to
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
cover the benefits for those private
 
04:43:37.590 --> 04:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
employees the second piece is a tax
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
incentive to private businesses to
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
encourage those businesses to pick up a
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
contract with that same insurer um in
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
order to build the pool of people who
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
would be participating and those
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
contracts would be directly between the
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
employee that employer and the insurance
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
company but they would get a half of
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
their payments that they pay in premium
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
returned as a credit to the business
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
um and so that could be a significant
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
cost and you know i didn't have figures
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
to say what exactly that is the third
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
piece of this program creates an
 
04:44:11.670 --> 04:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
individual pool which would be
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
run by the department of employment
 
04:44:13.360 --> 04:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
run by the department of employment
security

04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
um and that would the department of
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
employment security would be the
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
collections agent for the premiums from
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
individuals and then turn those over to
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
the private insurer who would administer
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
the program so that's just to say a
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
how it's structured because i don't
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
think that was necessarily clear earlier
 
04:44:30.798 --> 04:44:31.670 align:start position:0%
think that was necessarily clear earlier
um

04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
the so
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
employers that would have um so right
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
now the there's not a path there's not a
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
path at all for people in companies with
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
less than 50 employees
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
to get this program to get this benefit
 
04:44:47.110 --> 04:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
unless their employer opts in to cover
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
all of the people
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
so there's not a path for those people
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
to participate in the individual pool
 
04:44:54.230 --> 04:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
and employees of those small companies
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
already are less likely to have this
 
04:44:55.920 --> 04:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
already are less likely to have this
benefit

04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
but employers that do decide to opt in
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
and cover their employees they would get
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
the competitive edge to say they offer
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit but then there's nothing in
 
04:45:05.600 --> 04:45:06.470 align:start position:0%
the benefit but then there's nothing in
here

04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know they'd get a publicly
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
subsidized rate and on or tax credits
 
04:45:12.868 --> 04:45:12.878 align:start position:0%
but they could also deny employees to
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
take the benefit there's nothing that
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
that keeps them from punishing people
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know firing people for actually
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
taking the benefit
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
when they need it so they could be
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
retaliated against even though these
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
would be you know publicly subsidized
 
04:45:26.240 --> 04:45:29.190 align:start position:0%
would be you know publicly subsidized
benefits

04:45:29.190 --> 04:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh they also
 
04:45:32.550 --> 04:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of complications
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
about what if people work for two
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
employers you know one that's bigger
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
than 50 one that's smaller they'd be
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
eligible in certain part of their hours
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
and not eligible in certain other parts
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
of their hours the insurance company
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
would have control of the cost of
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
premiums the rate setting which could
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
lead to higher costs for employers with
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
more women or people with disabilities
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
they would be able to deny claims and
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
make the decisions about that to save on
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of benefits they would have to
 
04:45:58.390 --> 04:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
pay out and there's no process outlined
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
for appeal of denied claims or even
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of who's responsible for
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
who those appeals would be made to
 
04:46:06.240 --> 04:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
who those appeals would be made to
there

04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
also is um
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's silent on
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
my pages are messed up sorry about that
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
um it's silent on essential operating
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
questions like what if an employee
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
purchases the independent coverage for
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
leave but the employer fails to grant
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
the time off what if the employer
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes the time for leave but the
 
04:46:28.868 --> 04:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
independent insurer denies coverage how
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
are these disputes resolved there's
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to indicate how that's done
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
so the state would just be acting as a
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
collections agent for the private
 
04:46:35.600 --> 04:46:36.708 align:start position:0%
collections agent for the private
insurer

04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
insurer
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
and i haven't seen a legal opinion on
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's okay for the state to
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
charge low-income people in the
 
04:46:44.310 --> 04:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
individual pool the same premium as
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
higher income people but provide them
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
with significantly different benefits
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
because the way that the individual pool
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
rate is set right now is that people
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
would pay up to five dollars for the
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
benefit but then what they would get and
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's that's not differentiated between
 
04:46:59.910 --> 04:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
what they earn you know they would pay
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
up to five dollars it would probably be
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
five dollars
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
the state would pay any cost over that
 
04:47:06.550 --> 04:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
so that's another um thing that is in
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:47:08.868 --> 04:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
whether they make 130 000 or 12 an hour
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
they would be their benefits are based
 
04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
upon their wages so they're the benefit
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
would be paid out very differently for
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
low income people versus high income
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
people even though they're paying the
 
04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
so just the bottom line
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's been demand for
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
state policy for paid leave is because
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of working people don't have
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
it and there's significant disparity
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
between who has it and who doesn't and
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
the people least likely to have paid
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
leave are working people with the lowest
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
incomes and the most significant
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
public policy should be used to
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate that disparity but this
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
program will not do that it perpetuates
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
the status quo
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
it seeks to artificially prop up a
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
private insurance market that's failed
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
to function on its own with no actual
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
commitment to ensure working people will
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
great so uh my memory in the original
 
04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:04.868 align:start position:0%
great so uh my memory in the original
bill

04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
that part-time employee if you worked
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
less than 30 hours you could never make
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
a claim and yet you were still being
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
taxed you still excuse me you were still
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
being assessed
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
unless your employer was covering it
 
04:48:18.550 --> 04:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
himself that uh did they solve that
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
problem that was never the that was
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
never a situation um it was based the
 
04:48:25.990 --> 04:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
both the premium and the payout of
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
wage of wage replacement were based upon
 
04:48:29.910 --> 04:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
the number of hours worked what you
 
04:48:32.550 --> 04:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
might be remembering is that there was a
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
just like there is for unemployment
 
04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
insurance a requirement to work a
 
04:48:37.750 --> 04:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
minimum of seven thousand five hundred
 
04:48:37.760 --> 04:48:38.868 align:start position:0%
minimum of seven thousand five hundred
dollars

04:48:38.868 --> 04:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:48:40.868 --> 04:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
worth of wages in a certain period of
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
time there was that minimum that was you
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
know that people would have to it was 30
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
hours i was pretty positive it was
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
something that said you had to work 30
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
hours no that was never the situation
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay with this bill or with that one
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh representative amen
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh the bill before us is a repeal bill
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it sounded like you have many issues
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
with the program that's in place so
 
04:49:10.470 --> 04:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
would you be in favor of repealing this
 
04:49:10.480 --> 04:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
would you be in favor of repealing this
program

04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then coming back later and
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
instituting a program much more to your
 
04:49:16.320 --> 04:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
instituting a program much more to your
liking

04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
liking
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
i think that the problems involved with
 
04:49:22.550 --> 04:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
this program really need to be solved um
 
04:49:22.560 --> 04:49:23.430 align:start position:0%
this program really need to be solved um
and

04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
there are many ways to do that i think
 
04:49:25.440 --> 04:49:26.230 align:start position:0%
there are many ways to do that i think
we

04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know the way that we see it is that
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
we should solve these problems by
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
creating a program that works and the
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
way that a program would work would be
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
to cover everybody and have a pool that
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
would uh be large enough by to be able
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with adverse benefits i mean
 
04:49:41.110 --> 04:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
adverse selection of benefits for the
 
04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
question follow-up
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
so are you in favor of this bill or are
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
you against this bill i'm confused i'll
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
tell you what i'll tell you what i wrote
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
on your card uh she is supports the bill
 
04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
with amendment that's what that's
 
04:49:56.550 --> 04:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony was describing an
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that you'd like to see
 
04:50:04.948 --> 04:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
to completely change this building it
 
04:50:06.628 --> 04:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
would be describing an amendment that i
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
know would not pass this legislature but
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
that amendment would repeal this program
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
and replace it with a program that would
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative johnson so would you be
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
in favor of us
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
of supporting this repeal
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then late and then coming up
 
04:50:29.510 --> 04:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
later on with a better program
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
because this has so many flaws in it
 
04:50:33.750 --> 04:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
that i think it would be more convoluted
 
04:50:36.390 --> 04:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
to try to fix it now the way it sits
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
i um benefit from not being somebody who
 
04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
will actually be pushing a green or a
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
red button and so my position is that i
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
would support this with an amendment
 
04:50:50.788 --> 04:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's half a loaf
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
either way you go
 
04:50:56.550 --> 04:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to know what the
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
problems are because i think because
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
this never had a public hearing
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's not a process for solving all
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
these problems and in the absence of
 
04:51:06.150 --> 04:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
solving the problems we're saying that
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're meeting in need and meeting
 
04:51:08.160 --> 04:51:08.868 align:start position:0%
we're we're meeting in need and meeting
up

04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we're not meeting that need and so
 
04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's a really important
 
04:51:13.120 --> 04:51:16.310 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's a really important
point

04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs just two
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%

a non-profit organization and just a
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
further question you may include a
 
04:51:55.280 --> 04:51:57.670 align:start position:0%
further question you may include a
follow-up

04:51:57.670 --> 04:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%

04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
version of the bill um that was a
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
different program and we supported it
 
04:52:22.080 --> 04:52:23.510 align:start position:0%
different program and we supported it
wholeheartedly

04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
04:52:23.520 --> 04:52:25.190 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
aggressively

04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
aggressively
 
04:52:27.510 --> 04:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
there you go okay
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%

see none we thank you very much oh we do
 
04:52:31.840 --> 04:52:35.350 align:start position:0%
see none we thank you very much oh we do
yes

04:52:35.350 --> 04:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
this program that's presently in place
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes or that will soon go into motion or
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
whatever uh is is voluntary does that
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
mean that only those people who have
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
volunteered to pay for it will pay for
 
04:52:47.040 --> 04:52:48.628 align:start position:0%
volunteered to pay for it will pay for
it

04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
well voluntary in the sense that uh not
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
because if we don't talk about the state
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
employment everybody has to partake on
 
04:52:55.280 --> 04:52:56.070 align:start position:0%
employment everybody has to partake on
it

04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
is it only those people who volunteered
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
to pay for it let's just take the state
 
04:53:02.230 --> 04:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
employees out of the suit yes
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
04:53:03.760 --> 04:53:05.510 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
because

04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayers have not volunteered
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
to pay for the state employees
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
but they can volunteer to pay for
 
04:53:13.200 --> 04:53:14.868 align:start position:0%
but they can volunteer to pay for
themselves

04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
so the answer is no thank you very much
 
04:53:16.718 --> 04:53:18.470 align:start position:0%
so the answer is no thank you very much
um

04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
to ask you to answer your question
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
we are a representative government we
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
are a republic so the taxpayers
 
04:53:27.510 --> 04:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
are not ever given
 
04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
a direct opportunity to vote on what we
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
do here as a matter of fact we're one of
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
the few states that don't even let a
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
citizen referendums
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
that what we do have
 
04:53:40.390 --> 04:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
is us so if we were to fund the money in
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:53:44.070 --> 04:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
and vote for that budget
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
then yes for all types of purposes it it
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
would hold true
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
that only people who elect to be in it
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
have voted to be in it
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
until we get
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay i have no more cards
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
and we have um
 
04:54:03.840 --> 04:54:04.868 align:start position:0%
and we have um
uh

04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
seven people in support
 
04:54:09.470 --> 04:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
six opposed
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh al balozaro and len turcotte in
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
support and with that we will close the
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
i my new vacation days
 
04:54:34.948 --> 04:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
my new vacation dates are
 
04:54:34.958 --> 04:55:50.948 align:start position:0%
my new vacation dates are
um

04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:50.958 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
you
