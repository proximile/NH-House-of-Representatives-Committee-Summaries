the whole thing
 
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 align:start position:0%

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 align:start position:0%
of limitations of Civil actions related
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%

statute of limitations from 6 years to
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
20 years and I have
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
some background on what we would be
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
working on during that time HB 199 is
 
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 align:start position:0%

face in our locality is that s gobain

exposure they had difficulty keeping up
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
with the kind of filtration that is
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
needed in order to reduce the amount of

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
trillion many residents are still
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
unaware that there is a
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem despite many efforts um both in
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature and in the state
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
departments to notify and help people
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
find the resources they
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
need P I think the global issue is that
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
past producers have influenced and
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
delayed EPA regulations for decades
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
allowing continued past production and
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
continued widespread contamination when
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
we knew very well that there were
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
physical consequences for working in the
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
factory and using the firefighting phone
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
so why extend the statute of limitations
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
to calculate the scope of harm
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
especially for vulnerable groups such as
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
children elderly pregnant women and
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
nursing mothers to identify victims and
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
assess the full extent of the problem
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide to protect municipalities from
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
bearing disproportionate costs and to
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
Define Camin contamination zones based
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
on Wells meeting maximum contaminant
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
levels or less and to provide education
 
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
to Citizens and medical providers for
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction and care of value
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
valuation given the latency of illness
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
onset and the complexity of past
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
contamination extending the statute of
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
limitation to 20 years is
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
vital so what I did was I sent you
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
around a handout that says in New
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the 20year statute of
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
limitations for certain legal actions is
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
designed to serve several important
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
purposes instead of reading you that
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
entire document um if you just let me
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
know if it would be better but the key

we're saying you can come to New
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
can set up a business that over time
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
begins to contaminate an area and 3 to
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
six years later you know you don't have
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
to worry about what happens over the
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
next 20 years and you also don't have to
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
worry about um forever chemicals having
 
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
worry about um forever chemicals having
a

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
forever um statute of
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
limitations so the bill came through to
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
this committee as 1089
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
um and it was built on a bill House Bill
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
236 which was passed in
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
2021 and that bill was the one that
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
extended the statute of limitations from
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
3 to six years so at this point in time
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
that is proved to be too short of a
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
period of time and people believe that
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
having more time and having 20 years is
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
a step in the right
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
direction um the complexity of certain
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
cases such as those that are in inv
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
involve environmental law property law
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
um complex Finance Financial
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
transactions and um comprehensive
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
Medical Care um a longer statute allows
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
for proper fact finding and it also
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
allows for a date of finality for the
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
person who's seeking remedy and for the
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
company who is is settling
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
so we came up with the 20year statute of
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
limitations because this committee
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on the second bill
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
which was to open up the statute of
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
limitations entirely there was strong
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
testimony um in favor of the type of
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations that would be
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
applicable and there I'm sorry I don't
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
remember the gentleman's name but he was
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
an attorney from DC who came to tell us
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
about what kind of problems we would
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
have with an open-ended statute of
 
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:12.519 align:start position:0%
limitations so I think what I should do
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
at this point is leave you with
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and then take your questions
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
um I also circulated a testimony from
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
the honorable James McConnell who served
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislature from 2014 to 2018 he
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
is is a strong advocate for this bill he
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
would prefer however that instead of
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
extending the statute of limitations to
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
20 years that we remove it all together
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
but we did in the interim
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
study spend a a good amount of time and
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
I believe there was a thorough
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and it was clear to me that
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
this committee would not back a
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
um a open-ended statute of limitation
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
ations and this committee did vote in
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
favor of having
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
legislation but
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
not as a result of the committee
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
believing that this was a good bill it
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
was time to open up the conversation and
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
the committee would welcome another bill
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
with what I came to understand um and
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my testimony I
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
believe there's people that have a lot
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
of information behind me thank you very
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
much questions for this witness yes
 
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.670 align:start position:0%
much questions for this witness yes

know thank you and this is purely
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
housekeeping but you read some extensive
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
testimony there are you going to submit
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
that to the committee for the
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
clerk's um yes I can do that I'll send
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%

really appreciate that thank you other
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
I'm now going to call on representative
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas and I represent the
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
contaminated town of
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
marac uh past forever chemicals have
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
great health impacts we know this the
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
EPA has been reporting on it they have
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic uh properties they are
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
hormone disruptors and they have great
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
imp impact to General Health I want to
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
give you some examples of why this bill
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
necessary there was a study done in
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
Italy in a contaminated Town similar to
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
the town of marac with the same uh
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
levels of past
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
contamination where pregnant women were
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
drinking the water uh during their
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
pregnancy there was a higher rate of
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities of the babies that
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
were born to those women since then we
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
have confirmed that pasas in Ed during
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy results in some babies having
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh learning disabilities I just went
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
to a school board meeting in marac last
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
night 20% of our kids have learning
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities the CDC recommends that 20
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
points uh 20 parts per trillion is what
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
sets off screening uh screening
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
protocols uh if a mother ingests that
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
past uh contaminated water at the levels
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we have in our town and in this
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
town in Italy um the babies can can test
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
at 20 parts per trillion if they test at
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
20 parts per trillion that means they
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
start screening which means you start
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
screening babies for high cholesterol at
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
age one now how many people know that
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
even in our town I talk to people all
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
the time who who think that the water
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
problem is fixed um and that they don't
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
have to worry about pasas in the water
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
and or environment
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
anymore I mentioned that uh pasas is a
 
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
anymore I mentioned that uh pasas is a
hormone

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
hormone
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
disruptor anyone who has teenagers knows
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
the power of
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
hormones what we're finding is that
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
children ex that who are constantly
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
exposed to to past contaminated water
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
again at the levels we're seeing in
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
marac have a greater rate of
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
infertility that's not something you
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
discover until you've gone through
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
puberty and you've actually tried to
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
become pregnant or to to to be involved
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
in a pregnancy um if you're a boy um
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
we're also finding young boys uh who
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
have prostate cancer um and so that's
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations to start
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
screening 12 and 13y old boys for
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer um that's that's just
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
unheard of prostate as we know is
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
something that that typically hits older
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
men um I'm going to use my family as an
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
example we have a contaminated well that
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
is so contaminated it was shut down in
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
2018 uh we've been on bottled water for
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
the last six years that means that every
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
drop of water that I have had to drink
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
in the last six years has come from a
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
bottle every ounce of water that I use
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
to cook comes from a bottle we can't
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
sell our home my kids have moved out
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
they're adults who's going to buy a home
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
that doesn't come with
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
water um my kids are now adults they've
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
been exposed to this wellwater their
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
entire lives all of them have autoimmune
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
diseases all of them have P related
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
symptoms these are things that they're
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
just finding out now and they were
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
exposed when they were
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
kids many of you know um my personal
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
story I have a cancer that is considered
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
to be PE related it's a slow growing
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
cancer grade one which means that it
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
takes many years to develop I was lucky
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
it was identified it's been removed I
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
seem to be good right now however every
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
oncologist that I have spoken to has
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
said it's not if the cancer returns it's
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
when the cancer returns because I have
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
such high levels of past in my blood I
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
had my blood tested and I have 12 past
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
chemical that are over the toxic limit
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's allowed for humans in my
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
blood so you know they talk about
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
ticking time bombs my cancer could come
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
back tomorrow it could come back in six
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
years it could come
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
back in 20
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
years pasas is a man-made chemical it's
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
not something that is found in nature
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
and because of the carbon Florine bond
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
which which is uh identify it identifies
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
the chemical it's it's one of the
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
strongest bonds we have on the planet
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
Earth and it's very difficult to break
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
which is why these chemicals are called
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
Forever chemicals in our town ST gobain
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
which has abandoned their their facility
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
leaving us with this highly contaminated
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
building on this highly contaminated
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
piece of property has said it is too
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to clean up these chemicals
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
and so their plan is to let them just
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
naturally degrade but remember that
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
carbon Florine bond is impossible to
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
break which is why these are called
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
Forever chemicals so these chemicals put
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
there by this company are going to
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
impact our town
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
forever 20 years is not outrageous to
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
move for the statute of limitations
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a car accident
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
where you've broken a bone and 20 years
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
later you say this impacts my life we
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
are talking about chemicals that were
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
man-made that were put into our
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
environment that impacted innocent
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
people that have created Health havocs
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
in our town and in Southern New
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um by a company and I it is
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable in fact it is wise and
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
prudent to extend the statute of of
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
limitations to 20 years I'd be happy to
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for this
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
witness seeing yes representative trip
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh you said that you've been drinking
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
bottled water since
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
2018 uh no just the last well 2019 yeah
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's when when they started supplying us
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
this is what the uh the town of marac
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
considers to be a long-term
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
solution this is what s go Bain
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
considers a stop Gap solution it is not
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
it is not the town of Marx's decision s
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
ban offered this we have 700 families
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
receiving bottled water right now over
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
700 families on private Wells that are
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
receiving bottled
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
water follow up yes follow up please the
 
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
water follow up yes follow up please the
uh

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
so you said it's a stop Gap solution has
 
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.029 align:start position:0%
so you said it's a stop Gap solution has
the

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
uh do you think 20 years is long enough
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
for marac to determine that they uh want
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh St Cobain to pay to install water
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
lines so on my street um and they have
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
been saying for many years um that they
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
were going to hook us up to public water
 
00:23:41.549 --> 00:23:41.559 align:start position:0%
um and last fall they they put the pipes
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
in our street but they um so we're
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
planned this this I believe this spring
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
to to be hooked up to public water the
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
problem with public water is that it is
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
filtered at the treatment plant however
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
it then goes through contaminated pipes
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
to get to our house so even if I'm
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
hooked up to public water it's still not
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
considered well I don't think it's
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
considered safe because there is no safe
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh level of
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
PS thank you representative Perez thank
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question I'm
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
from London da you're preaching to the
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
choir um I
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
have we
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
have hundreds of people in londondary
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
who took advantage of getting the
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
filtration system in
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
was your is there was your P level not
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
high enough to qualify for that or did
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
you just choose not to do
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
um when I joined the citizens Action
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
Group in March that was um organized
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
around pest at first you know we didn't
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
really have we didn't have any science
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
at the time we just knew many of us had
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
a medical science background we knew
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
that these were hormone disrupting
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
chemicals and curs enic so um the state
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
told us there there's a boundary around
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
s gobain initially the state told us
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
that if you lived half a mile from s
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
Cain you didn't have to be worried about
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
it they then updated it and they said
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay our bad if you live a mile from St
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
Cain um more than a mile you don't have
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
to worry about it um my family lives
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
three miles from St
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
Cain I mentioned I have six children I
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if I give you the number but
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
I had uh six young children at the time
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so I had our private well tested
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
independently and it came back so high
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't use it
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
anymore what my husband and I did is we
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
installed a whole house filtration
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
system which is what I think you're
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
talking about at the time it was $3,500
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
to install that we also put in a a
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis uh for point of of use
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
um for the water and that is the only
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
water that I would allow us to use
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it didn't occur to me and
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
and and I sleep with this guilt every
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
single night not to give our dogs
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
filtered water um I've had four dogs die
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
of cancer um and lots of the dogs and
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
cats in marac are dying of cancer which
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that I Bang the
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
Drum about you know give them filtered
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
water give them bottled water they are
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
the canaries and the coal mine um so we
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
paid for the filtration however there
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
are 14,000 chemicals uh in the p uh
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
category um and we can't test for them
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
all St gobain won't give us a complete
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
list because they say it's proprietary
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
so even though we have filtration we
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
safe other questions for this witness
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes representative M thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
could you be very specific about the
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
problems with the six-year statute of
 
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
problems with the six-year statute of
limitations

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
um I think that the examples that I gave
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
um just clearly indicate why you need
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
longer than six years um a baby who is
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
born with a past learning disability
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
typically learning disabilities aren't
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
discovered until they start school which
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
is like age 56 so you know then you have
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
testing and everything and it's
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to to connect it back to the
 
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.269 align:start position:0%
difficult to to connect it back to the
original

00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
P it's difficult to do that anyway um in
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
my personal case with my um cancer you
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
know I have a diagnosis date for my
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
cancer which is almost three years ago
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
um so so let's say that that I I file
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
for damages and I I get that covered
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
what happens you know 5 years from now
 
00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
when I get another cancer that's pasas
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
related because of the the p in my blood
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
is that is that a new injury is that a
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
continued injury um there are so many
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
questions about how
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
P um impacts human health that that I
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
I'm actually on team forever for that
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
removing any statute of limitations but
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
I think 20 years is prudent and wise
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
other qu representative P pel thank you
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
um could you tell me how you
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
differentiate between an illness that's
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
been caused by pasas versus some other
 
00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
been caused by pasas versus some other
um

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism because we are con surrounded
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
by chemicals everywhere so I'm really
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
con I mean is it just based on symptoms
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
or is it just because you have high
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
levels of pasas I I mean because 20
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
years is a really long time for anything
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
to occur in anybody right and I I think
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
the the necessity for 20 years is that
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
this is measured in such small amounts
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion and we don't know
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
what the Tipping Point is for exposure
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know if it's one a onetime
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
exposure we don't know if it's a chronic
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
exposure we don't know how long um with
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
regard to identifying P related
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
illnesses what we have right now is a
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
list from the CDC of confirmed symptoms
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
which doesn't include my cancer um but
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
but it is um symptoms along with with uh
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
diagnostic blood work that shows that P
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
is in your your body that's that's all
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
we have right now which is which is
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
actually insufficient which is why we
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
need a Time extension because new
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
information is coming out every
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
day yeah yeah follow oh I'm
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I like to do that too when I'm
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
there um have you are you familiar with
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
causality yes yes um however um there I
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
live in a town where we have incredibly
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
High rates of of cancer as I mentioned
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
we've got cats and dogs that are dying
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
all the time um it's not too difficult
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
in my town to connect the dots other
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
question yes representative rmo uh thank
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
question um just to clarify in terms of
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
this actual statute of limitations
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
meaning that am I correct understanding
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
that you'd have 20 years to bring action
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
does not change the standard of what
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
evidence have to provide or how you'd
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
have to prove your claim in terms of a
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
connection which could be a long time
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
and obviously there could be a lot of
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
intervening factors but it would just
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
preserve the right to bring the action
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
within that 20 year window
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
correct other questions for this witness
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you whoops I'm sorry
 
00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:49.549 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you whoops I'm sorry
representative

00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you for taking my question
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
sure I just wanted to know do you feel
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
it's important right now for our younger
 
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
folks to be introduced to the issues or
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
just p in general just seeing as you've
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
been exposed to a lot of different
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
organizations oh my God that's like what
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
I do oh I mean i' I've been working with
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock on um educational
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
material for the general public as well
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
as for Physicians um The Physician who
 
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519 align:start position:0%
did I've had um three very extensive
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
surgeries for uh cancer The Physician
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
that did my first operation when I
 
00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559 align:start position:0%
showed her the blood work results that
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
that show showed that I had 12 past
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals over the toxic limit she
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
literally didn't look at it she pushed
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
it back and she said I'm just a surgeon
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
I don't need to know about past and I
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
got up and I walked out of the room and
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
I said you are no longer my surgeon um
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
and so you know it's it's it's things
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
like that there
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
are there are three of us in March that
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
were that were identified as water
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
Warriors and this is what we have we
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
have devoted Our Lives to I mean I I
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
hold um workshops all the time on the
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
dangers of PS I I
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
join protests I organize you know events
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
I Bang the Drum all the freaking
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
time so at this point there's not like
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
an official program so like either you
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
know school kids or like no no there
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
isn't but there should be all right and
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
I would support a bill if you put one in
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank any other questions for
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
this witness another housekeeping issue
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
do you you read some testimony do you
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
have that to submit to the
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee yes oh got it thank you all
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
right any other questions for this
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
please good morning Mr chair members of
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
Mike wison sat I serve as director of
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
the waste management division for the
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh the agency is
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on this bill but
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
we did want to come before the committee
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
today to acknowledge that this is past
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
contamination is something that we've
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
been working very very hard on for more
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
than 10 for 10 years now and um we first
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
discovered some significant releases
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
from a couple of facilities in Southern
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh back in
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
2016 and since that time we've uh
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
embarked on uh expansive sampling
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
efforts and we've been able to determine
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
that there are literally thousands of
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells both private
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells and a number of
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
public Supply Wells that have been
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
impacted uh by past contamination at
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
levels above the standards that have
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
been set and so we've worked very hard
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
to um make sure that folks get access to
 
00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
clean water in in the wake of that and
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh really just wanted to acknowledge
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
that uh you know there are as as you've
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony a number of concerns
 
00:33:59.149 --> 00:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
about potential health effects
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
associated with past contamination and
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
so um this is something that we we've
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
worked on very hard we continue to work
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
every day there are a number of people
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
at Dees that devote much of their work
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
to um evaluating sites that have past
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
contamination and trying to ensure that
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
people aren't getting exposed to these
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
contaminants and I'll I'll leave it at
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
that and be happy to answer any
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
sir thank you I that's the last of the
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
pink cards I have on House Bill 199 is
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry Mr
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
Grace sorry about that sorry Mr chair I
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
know my handwriting is awful didn't see
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
it I I'm sorry n GRA with the uh
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association uh we
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation um and the
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
reason for our uh opposition here is
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
really in lines uh 6 through 8 in the
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
section of the statute that is not
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
modified uh which says after the date
 
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff discovers or in the
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
exercise of reasonable diligence should
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
have discovered the harm and the Casual
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
relationship uh to the harm causal
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
relationship causal relationship sorry
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um uh So currently we have six years
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
after those two components
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
are um met to bring that lawsuit
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we don't think it's necessary to
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
extend that to 20 years and the reason
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
for that really goes back to the reason
 
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
for the statute of limitations in the
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
first place um which is that evidence
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
becomes stale after time um memories
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
fade documents are lost um you lose the
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
ability to uh make that uh that
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
effective argument there's a
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
relationship between the harm and the
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
cause um and that's my third Point here
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
here um is that there are other
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
intervening uncertainties so the closer
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
in time you can have that lawsuit um the
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
clearer it is the connection uh you know
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
if you have an an injury with
 
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
intervenient events that may also cause
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
that same kind of injury uh the facts
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
are going to get blurred by those
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
intervening issues so as an example that
 
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
I'm completely making up because I have
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
no idea if there's a relationship here
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
you know if if scientists say you know P
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
causes lung cancer
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then someone develops lung cancer
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
but they also uh start smoking after the
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
after that point in time when they have
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
that exposure you know if you have 20
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
years it's going to be very hard for the
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
FactFinder the court system uh and the
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
jury to determine you know what portion
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
of that is due to the exposure to uh
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
tobacco which is well established as a
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
cause of lung cancer and versus the
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
pasas um so you know
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
once it it is it just seems more
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable from our perspective to uh
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
keep this uh statute limitations short
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
um and I would already I would point out
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
that it is already twice as long as the
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
standard civil statute limitations happy
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and yes
 
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and yes
representative

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.150 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much Mr chair and
um

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
are are is the business and industry
 
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
Association saying that they have no
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
confidence in the judicial system in
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
this country in which a judge and a jury
 
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
would weigh facts and make
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
determinations as to what is reasonable
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore we have to protect people
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
from um participating in the judicial
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
system absolutely not representative
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
Smith uh we would never suggest that we
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
have no confidence in the judicial
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
system it's a very robust system we have
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
all the confidence in the world in it uh
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
what I would offer is that I think it
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
would be easier for the judicial system
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
and we would have a more accurate uh
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
assessment of the of the harm uh based
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
on the existing statute limitations
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
rather than than one uh an additional 14
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
years down the line um after the injury
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
has occurred and the relationship thank
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
you and I'll only do one followup Mr
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
chair although I might be tempted to do
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
a dozen or two dozen um are are you
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
saying then that if
 
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.470 align:start position:0%
saying then that if
reality

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
unfolds and new information is available
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
including ining new information as to
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
how these forever chemicals are
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
affecting the citizens of this state and
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
this country that too bad we only should
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
have a very limited period of time um in
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
order for
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
justice to be
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
protected representative Smith I'd go
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
back to lines 6 through 8 here um and
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
just point out that it's there's a
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
two-part test it's after the harm is
 
00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
discovered and also the relationship
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
between in this case the exposure to p
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and the the harm so that's when
 
00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:46.119 align:start position:0%
the statute takes place um or begins
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
begins that that process of running Mr
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
chair I'm going to honor my um statement
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
that I won't ask any questions I just
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody to think that that's
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
because I'm comfortable with the
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
response representative
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
CH yeah thank thanks and thanks for
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
taking the question um building on on uh
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
question that representative Pell asked
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
of the last witness um the statement
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
cause uh caus uh correlation does not
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
equal causation um worked enough with
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
numbers through my life that I
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
understand the concept there you seem to
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
be suggesting that with time the the
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
prove and and build on a case that would
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
require you to show causality
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
essentially gets weaker um from what I
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
believe the previous Witnesses have said
 
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the statistics the
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
numbers needed in order to go from
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
simple correlation to what would
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
approximate you know scientific
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
causality to the extent that that can be
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
known grows over time because we are
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
accumulating knowledge um not just of
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of the problem but also
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
the dimensions of the problem so I'm
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can see that both
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
things can be true yes we getting
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
further away from the cause but this is
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
not like you know a car accident where
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
something happened um and then as time
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
Fades the the memory of that this I
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
believe Falls more into the category of
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
where we know that the harm may be
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing and our knowledge is only
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
growing so could you respond to the
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
difference between sort of your
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
assertion that you know the case grows
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
weaker over time you as opposed to being
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to get to the point where you might
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
be able to prove your
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
issue sure happy to do so um and I I I
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
would point out that I think this is why
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh struck a balance and
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
picked six years uh back in 2021
 
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
extending the timeline past three years
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
because legislature recognized that
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of research going into
 
00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
this area um discovering of this causal
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
causal relationship um and also uh you
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
know we were seeing uh you know we knew
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
harms existed and we were we were being
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
able to associate them with a cause
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
um I think the what I would in response
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
to what you're saying um I I would PR
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
out kind of the other un my bucket of
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
other uncertainties and just for the
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
clerk's knowledge I'm more than happy to
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
write up a a quick summary of my
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
testimony today and send that to you um
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
the you know so if you you have an event
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh or a series of events that you know
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
causes a a specific harm uh you know
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
someone is in the military they're
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
exposed to burn pits for example uh
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
causes lung cancer uh and then a variety
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
of other things and then they leave the
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
military they start smoking they smoke a
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
pack a day um they develop cancer eight
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
years in it's a lot easy after leaving
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
the military it's a lot easier to make
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
that relationship between the burn pit
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
exposure and uh and the cancer then 20
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
years down the line you've had an
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
accumulation of exposures to uh the
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
carcinogens in the tobacco smoke over a
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
longer period of time um so it's not as
 
00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
easy to uh associate that uh with the
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
developing cancer
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
I see that I'm not persuading you but I
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
you know that's my that's my response
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
all I'll say is and and it's a qu I'll
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
ask it as a question but is it not true
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
that cancer is if if you discovered
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
cancer a month after being exposed to a
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
burn pit you could almost exclude the
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
cause you know I'm not familiar enough
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
with that but I assume that's probably
 
00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.710 align:start position:0%
with that but I assume that's probably
the

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
case other questions for this witness
 
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.309 align:start position:0%
case other questions for this witness
representative

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
Perez just a comment in the fact that
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
Dupont is as recently as
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
2022 had cases go against them for what
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
happened in the 1950s to the 1980s so
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
right any other questions so I guess the
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
thing that question that I I I think the
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
other question seem to have missed is
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
this as I understand the law
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
now before the statute of limitation
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
starts running whether it's 3 years or
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
six years or 17 years or 20 years you
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
have to know that you've been injured
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
and know that it's causally connected to
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
whatever you're suing about so my
 
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.349 align:start position:0%
whatever you're suing about so my
question

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
is if you know that you've been injured
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
and you know that the cause is
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
p if we if I understand correctly if if
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
under the current law with the knowledge
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
of both of those things you have six
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
years to bring
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
suit why does it make sense if you have
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of those things and it's
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
only having that knowledge that starts
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitations running why
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
if you have that knowledge should you
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
have 17 years to bring a lawsuit should
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
you be able to just sit around and say
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know I know that the that St Goin
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
has hurt me and it's hurt me in this way
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going to sit on my hands
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
for 17 years why does does that make
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
sense I don't believe it
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
does Mr chair I believe you should call
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
a lawyer as soon as you can make those
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
two uh those those meet those two things
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for this
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
you now I do not believe I have any
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
other Witnesses on uh House Bill 199 is
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to be heard
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 19
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
9 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
199 and I'm going to open the hearing on
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.309 align:start position:0%
House Bill
268

00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
268
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
FN and I'm going to think I only have
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
one witness listed here I'm going to
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
no exactly exactly all right good
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
morning chairman honorable members of
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for listening to
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
my testimony and a special thank you to
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
Chairman Lynn for sponsoring this
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislation on behalf of the board of
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
tax and land
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
appeals oh I'm sorry you're AB no you're
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
me ah thank you I just think you're more
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
CH yes if I had a gavel I
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
would the chair recognizes
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill can you put your button on Sir so
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
the red lights I I apologize for uh not
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill but I propose to do
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
so now so this bill is basically as I
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
understand it and and we'll have a
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
witness who has who can I think give you
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
more detail but basically based upon my
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with Miss LeBron the who
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
asked me to introduce this bill um this
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
bill is basically designed um to kind of
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
confirm what essentially happens pretty
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
routinely right now that that it would
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
allow the btla to hold their hearings um
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
in conquered in there and they should
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
you should understand that they already
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
have a hearing room they're not asking
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
for like a new hearing room or
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
additional facilities it's just
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
basically uh to sort of confirm that
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
they can hold their hearings um in their
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
hearing rooms um uh in the hearing room
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
and conquered um uh and which is as I
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
understand it mostly happening or
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
happening you know relatively routinely
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
now um and so it seemed to me to make
 
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
sense um I from looking at the card
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
which I saw of only one witness I assume
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
that you know that there's not
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
opposition to this and so I think that
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
we ought to pass it because it makes it
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
it makes practical sense and I um if
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to ask questions about the
 
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
details I hope you will wait for Miss uh
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
either Miss LeBron or the witness uh Mr
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
wind any questions none seeing none
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you oh representative sorry quick
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
just quick question this seems very
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
specific for legislation like
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
authorizing that there be a room I'm not
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
sure uh just from your perspective about
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
legislation in general why it's needed
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
that this be captured in in statute
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
rather than in practice well you know I
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
I think the the issue
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
I suppose would be that um somebody
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
without a statute I suppose somebody
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
could you know I guess could say well I
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
want to have my hearing if the if the uh
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
if the matter
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
involves um a tax dispute in Coos County
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
I want to have my hearing in Coos County
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
um and the and arguably I don't know
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
whether I mean this would be a legal
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
question arguably there could be a claim
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
of you know you have a right to venue in
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
Coos County I don't know if that would
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
would would apply in this kind of a case
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
before an administrative agency or not
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
but at least there could be an argument
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
and I think I again I would leave it to
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
miss LeBron to to tell us or or Mr W to
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
tell us if there's been any real issues
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
on that uh but I think this would this
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
would clarify that you can have the you
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
can hold the hearings at the at the
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
bureau's offices so I think that
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
probably would be one of the one of of
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
that any other questions saying none
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
wind all right good morning and thank
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
you again my name is Eric wind I am a
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
member of the board of tax and land
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
appeals also in attendance with me as
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
chair LeBrun and our executive director
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
so we will answer any questions but I
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
think I can be pretty brief in
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
describing the issue um as raised by
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Turner so this is a very
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
specific problem that we're increasingly
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
having in the imminent domain procedures
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
act so there's a very specific act that
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
prescribes the process that must be used
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
in imminent domain actions and included
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
in that requirement is that a
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that the board hold a
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on just compens ation in the
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
county where the taking is occurring the
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that is the problematic language that
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
is in the
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute um and it it it suggests
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
that it should happen in the county
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
courthouse if available otherwise it
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
should be held in such place or places
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public as the board
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
shall direct so the problem that we're
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
increasingly encountering is that County
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
cour houses do not have room for us as
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
the number of Judges is increasing our
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
last reliable Courthouse that would make
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
space available for us was Rockingham
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
and they now have full
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
courtrooms so from there we go on this
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
process of directing our administrative
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
staff to try to find some kind of public
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
space in the county where a just
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
compensation hearing can be held um and
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we look at other State Properties we
 
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
wind up usually seeking Municipal
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
properties some municipalities are
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
willing to entertain it but they often
 
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
times have a fee to use their properties
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
for hearings um so it goes on and on
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
that we go on this trail of asking the
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to wave their fee which
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
has to go before the
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
selectman um and so it it it's a long
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
kind of cumbersome process this is a law
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
that was written in the 1971 last
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
updated in 1982 for this specific
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
provision and so really as we're in the
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
21st century it just makes sense in a
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
cost effective way that might actually
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
save money by reducing the amount of
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
State travel to use our existing hearing
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
room use our existing remote
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies to hold hearings um and to
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
authorize that instead of going through
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
a process of seeking space in the county
 
00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
first um so that's the solution that we
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
are proposing as the bill has drafted I
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
would make one recommendation
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
respectfully that the effective date be
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
modified to make it of 60 days after
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
passage instead of on January 1 2026 I I
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
understand that this is in the judicial
 
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
title of the RSA so that I'm sure that
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the effective date was
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
selected but this is an agency request
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
and I think it should be treated as any
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
other agency request and made effect of
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
60 days um after passage so with that
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions are
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
there any questions of this witness
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
T yeah thank thank you and thanks for
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question so and I appreciate
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
you're clarifying the the answer I'm
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
wondering reading sort of the additions
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the the paragraph here there's
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
two things going on one it sounds like
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
it's authorizing electronic or
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
telephonic participation and then before
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
that it talks about a suitable room is
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
it really the intent that you need a
 
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
room suitable for electronic
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
participation is that and is it just the
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
way it's constructed that makes it sound
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
like these are two separate
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
requirements so the suitable hearing
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
room language is a direct copy out of
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
RSA 71b which is the board's primary
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
statute enabling statute and that just
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
has the language that the state shall
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
provide this board with a suitable room
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
for hearings so that was truly just
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
copied and pasted over um as far as the
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
electronic participation the intent
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
there was to honor the spirit of the
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
statute that this is imminent domain
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
this is taking someone's property and we
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
want to be accommodating and offer it
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
convenience where possible um so that is
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
why we proposed adding the language
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
participation representative
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
mayos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you be open
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
to um the parties being able to elect
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
whether the hearing is held in the
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
county where the taking taking took
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
I think we're very open to suggestion um
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
on that we're just raising the issue
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
that we are having an administrative
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
burden and trying to schedule the
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
hearings in the county where the taking
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
takes place the statute does already
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
have a provision where the parties could
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
agree to a hearing elsewhere there is
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
burden to getting that level of
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
agreement too because in most takings
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with banks that have
 
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
mortgages as that they're going to be a
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
party as well so there are burdens to
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
seeking everyone's agreement um but
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely if they want to elect to hold
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
to request the just compensation hearing
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
be held in the county then I think we
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
would be open to a provision like that
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll also note it that not in this
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
bill is the parties by right can request
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
a view of their property and nothing
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
would change of that so the board would
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
still if they request a VI we would
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
still go up and take a look at the
 
00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
property thank you any other questions
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any more pink cards is
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
there anyone else here that wants to
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill seeing none I'm going
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing on House
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
Bill you have a just oh I didn't know we
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
umone my name is Michelle LeBrun and I
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
am the chair of the board of tax and
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
land appeals in response to that last
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
question the problem that we are having
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
is that we cannot find
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
locations to hold the hearings so if the
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
parties ask us to hold the hearing in
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
coaz county and there isn't a location
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
available that's why we offer would
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
would like to offer the
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
virtual um
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
me way of handling the case the law also
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
states in the next section that we take
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
a view upon request of the parties we
 
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
would take a view of the of the excuse
 
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
me of the property that's being taken
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
after the hearing if the parties request
 
00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.390 align:start position:0%
after the hearing if the parties request
it

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
so even if they don't have the hearing
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
right in the county that the property is
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
located if they want a view of the
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
view thank you are there any questions
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you and could
 
00:58:09.549 --> 00:58:09.559 align:start position:0%

will thank
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
you okay at this point I will ask if
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
there anyone else that wants to speak on
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
this bill seeing none I'm going to close
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
what we just recess for a minute I just
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
want to Judiciary Community being recess
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
so you know let me just ask a question
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
and again as I said as I've said from
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
the beginning I'm not going to do this
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
if there's any kind of you know
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
significant opposition but based on my
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
discussions with the ranking member it
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
appears that this might be a bill that
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
we could EXA now I've talked with uh the
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
the witnesses who appeared and uh
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
although they would although they would
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
prefer to to move up the effective date
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh they're comfortable with us executing
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
it if we're comfortable with it and then
 
01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039 align:start position:0%
they would propose to make that change
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the Senate um which I assume you know
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
would would would happen so the question
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
is are we comfortable with executing
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
this now as it say anybody has a pro I'm
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
not trying to force anything on anybody
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
if anybody has a problem we won't
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
first well let's well right let's take
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
let's stick to this one first but
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
but is there a reason that you would
 
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
prefer to hold on so uh yes I I my
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
inclination would be to say that it be
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
held and conquered unless a party
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
objects and requests a hearing in the
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
county okay um can I just ask for uh
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
clarification on that sir I don't have
 
01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:21.039 align:start position:0%
the full rsas in front of me obviously
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
and I don't have your rules my
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that oh I I don't have
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
the rsas or the rules in front of me my
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the board does in
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
fact uh Begin by
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
trying to meet the requests of the
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
parties and it's because of the
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
difficulties in finding an appropriate
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
place that this would then come in am I
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
wrong about that that's that's my that's
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I you know I I mean
 
01:01:58.269 --> 01:01:58.279 align:start position:0%
you're I I think I I would say
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative you are correct that in
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
this sense if we were to pass this the
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
parties would not be able to object to
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
having it Inc conquered um um and so
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's that's true but I
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
think for the reasons my inclination is
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that representative
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
Smith was saying it you know that um
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
that there is this problem that and I
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
guess one of the things that would
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
concern me if we to leave the law the
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
way it is if there is significant
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
problem with finding places um somebody
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
could insist on well I don't care what
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
your problems are you you know I want it
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
in this location which could end up
 
01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
delaying proceedings and some and maybe
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
that maybe one party or the other in
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
some particular case would like that to
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
to just delay the proceedings so but
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps if the board came back and said
 
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
we're you know Mr Smith we're having
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding a place the parties
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
would then agree to hold it and
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
conquered I I just
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
think I just think people should have
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
the at least in the first instance the
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
option of requesting a a hearing in the
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
county all right so let me add I mean
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
again I are you objecting then to our
 
01:03:16.279 --> 01:03:19.910 align:start position:0%
again I are you objecting then to our
voting

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
now yes because I don't think this bill
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
gives any option I don't know maybe we
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
could quickly hear from the witnesses
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
again as to whether even if this bill
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
were passed CL the hearing no you know
 
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
what given given your uh representative
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
Manos concern and the fact that we don't
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know we we have a number of people
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
missing I'm I'm not going to I'm not
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with executive okay
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
um representative BD but I call upon you
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
just to to introduce House Bill 337 all
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
you have to do is say you're introducing
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
it and you will not take any questions
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll then turn it over to
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who is prepared to respond okay
 
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
so we're discussing 337 is that correct
 
01:04:45.309 --> 01:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:04:45.319 --> 01:04:47.710 align:start position:0%

or

01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
I good afternoon Jay Bucky executive
 
01:06:23.269 --> 01:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
director of the judicial
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
Council uh I came this morning um not to
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
take a position either way on the bill
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
but mostly to make myself available if
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
members had any questions and also just
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
to one point of clarification I had when
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
I read the bill um which is that the
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
bill uh states that all members of the
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
judicial Council should file disclosures
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
um and then it lists two specific kinds
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
of members who should specifically file
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
disclosures my only um the only thing I
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out would be in
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
interpreting the bill for me I think
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
future directors it would be perhaps
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
simpler just to State all members of the
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
judicial Council and then not
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
specifically enumerate different kinds
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
simply because it adds a little bit of
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
ambiguity um when I read the bill and
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
that was my only clarification point
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to bring to the attention
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee all we have yes uh
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative trip is it clarified
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who are members of the
 
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.150 align:start position:0%
elsewhere who are members of the
judicial

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
judicial

counil yes representative there's a the
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
enumerated in statute and it encompasses
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
judges uh Court administrators members
 
01:07:34.109 --> 01:07:34.119 align:start position:0%

01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
representatives of the head of the house
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and Senate Judiciary Committee
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
witness Mr Bucky can I ask you with
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
regard to the to section one of the bill
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
the the reporting requirement am I
 
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.510 align:start position:0%
the the reporting requirement am I
incorrect

01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
that other than judges and I'll get to
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
them in a moment but but other than
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
judges um all the members of the the
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
judicial council is an executive branch
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
agency I thought all the members of the
 
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
agency I thought all the members of the
judicial

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
Council other than judges who have their
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
own Financial disclosure requirements
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and legislators who we also have our own
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
Financial disc that all of them had did
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
had right now had to file closures am I
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
wrong on that I I believe the ambiguity
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
becomes um because some of them are
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Chief Justice and not
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
by the governor Council and in reviewing
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
15a uh It generally speaks to me it
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
speaks to appointments by governor and
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
counsel not by not to appointments by
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice and that was the
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation I see I see
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes of course so thank you for
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you looking to
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
strike on line three everything after
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
judicial Council so including members of
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
the appointed by the Judiciary and
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
members of the half Bar Association and
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
just leave
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
it I I believe that would be simpler
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
from from my perspective yes and I think
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
it accomplish what I understand the
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
goals of the bill to be thank
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you Mr Bucky
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
you are there any other Witnesses who
 
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
337 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
337

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
can I can I raise uh can I raise um and
 
01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
I raise a question here regarding um the
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
um I you know I I I understand in uh the
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
the point that um the witness made and
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
that in response to the vice chair's
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
question um and arguably we could take
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
out that the language on line three that
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
three and four that says including
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the Judiciary and
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
and members of the New Hampshire Bar
 
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
and members of the New Hampshire Bar
Association

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.470 --> 01:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of if we wanted to if
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted to exec this bill now um I'm
 
01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
not sure that that is particularly
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
important I mean you know if we had that
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
language in there so what it doesn't
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
not yeah no it might have been I mean
 
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly I don't think that so I
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
guess the question is um are we is
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
everyone comfortable with executing this
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
now um if anybody you know if anybody
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
has a problem again I'm not going to
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
exec something if people have a problem
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
with it but if nobody has a problem yes
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
so the so the change would be to remove
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
lines uh one through four no we wouldn't
 
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
make any changes we wouldn't make any
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
changes we just we just OTP the bill as
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
is it includes those members but it
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't exclude anyone else that's part
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
of the council so
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
right um I come on come on come on in
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
so um so um you know Eric what just uh
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative tur I apologize
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
um what um what we were just talking
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
about is um should we exact
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
337 now um as you I think you were in
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
the room when there there was discussion
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
between the witness and uh in response
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
to uh Vice chair manion's uh question
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
about you know suggesting that we
 
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
possibly could remove the language on
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
lines three and four that says including
 
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the Judiciary and
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
members of the New Hampshire Bar
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
Association um the what we were
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
discussing is if we wanted to execute
 
01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
now I mean leaving that language in
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt anything it's not it it
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't really hurt anything um and I
 
01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
think as representative Perez had
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out you know there may have been
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
a specific reason why they wanted to
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
emphasize that point um so I guess the
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
question is is I would propose if
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's agreeable to ex cheing this
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
now with an ought to pass but again I'm
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
not going to do it if anybody's
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with doing that everybody
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
is everybody okay with
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah oh no absolutely we're g we're
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
gonna wait a moment so that we can the
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
this one two three four five two three
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we had a
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
well okay all right somebody somebody
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
willing to make the motion on
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
this don't everybody speak at
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
once I'll do it I'll make the you make
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
represent Oh I thought you had a
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
question want you to be surprised by
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
making the
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
motion which I think is a very good idea
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
because it introduces you you will then
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
by the chair who won't tell you now but
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
will tell you
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
after that you have to write the
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
report that will go in the calendar when
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
we vote on it in the house and I will
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
just like you to know that all of us
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
will help you with that so don't worry
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
about it and this means that once this
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
happens you've been introduced so I
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
would go ahead but I just want you to
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
understand not to be surprised when the
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
chair then says okay by the end of
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow you have to write the report
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay good all right all right so

um that it establishes to the
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and to the Supreme Court I
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
think they're already reported to the
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I think but this would say
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
legislature um and that really you know
 
01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
I think that uh that could be it it
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
literally can be one or two
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
sentences great all right so
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative you write this and you
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
um good bill of doing um yeah so you
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
know all right so um you know what I
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
this is um I know we don't have
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
everybody here but um
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
I wanted to um I I briefly discussed
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
this with representative Manion and and
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smith but I just want to
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
raise this with
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
everyone we've there are seven bills
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
that that came in after the scheduling
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
I've I've done for February there are
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
seven bills that that came in that we
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
have to hold hearings on at least one or
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
maybe two of them I don't have the I
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't have it right off the top of my
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
head our early bills so what that means
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
is we are going to have to have another
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
day of hearings
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the um the 5th the 12th and the
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
19th in order to get our work done and
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
so as I've tried to figure this out
 
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
including like the availability of this
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
room I think we are down
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
to there are two potential days that we
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
could do that one would be February
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
Monday February 17th and that's while
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm still away uh and that personally
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
that would not be the preferred day to
 
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
me but but I is that a Federal
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
holiday yes that's president is it okay
 
01:21:08.110 --> 01:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
some of us will be celebrating okay so
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
this may
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
okay February 17th yeah President's Day
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right now I'm sorry
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess then that what expain to you
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
why I
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
know I was born on February 22nd which
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
is George Washington birthday I remember
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
that and in fact we can never celebrate
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
George Washington's birthday on the 22nd
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
because the latest it can be because we
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
need a three-day weekend is the
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
21st and so that's how I know okay all
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
right so in light of that I'm sorry
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
it so I think what we're down to then is
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
um we're going to need to hold that
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
hearing either on the 26th or the 27th
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
now that's the week that you know people
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
are are so who's going to I know who's
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
going to be away I object okay all right
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
I think we have to find another dat all
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
right so how many bills are there well
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
on the difficult bills right there's
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
they are difficults no they they are
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're difficult we're not
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to get through them in half
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
so um you know what the problem is this
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
I've scheduled I mean I you correct me
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong I I I I'm for three of
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
those days I'm not going to be here and
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
so I tried I mean I think I've scheduled
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
relatively aggressively for those three
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
days there's seven bills on two of them
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
and eight bills on the third one I think
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's you know if you tell me you want
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
to hear more I'm Not Gon to I'm not
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
going to be here so it'll be that's fine
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
with me but I think that you're I think
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
that that's probably not fair to you um
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
we I just it seems like if you don't
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
want to do it that
 
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
want to do it that
week

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um then and we can't do it on the 17th
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna well no the problem is
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes I think you're I think you're
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
reading from you're reading from you're
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
think representative trip
 
01:23:55.199 --> 01:24:00.430 align:start position:0%
think representative trip
representative

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%

01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
per

01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
thata problem is I have to do this I
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
have to I have to put it in the calendar
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
by noon that's my problem we want it for
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
next week it has to be it has to be in
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
the calendar by noon all right so next
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
week we do have the third what you could
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
be here and we have um we're already
 
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
here on the
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
fifth we have the
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
seven no no we don't no because state
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
federal uses this room on the on the
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
there no other room available I I don't
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
know I mean I know that last year when I
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
tried to get something and they're
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
meeting every week they I think they
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
think they are
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
until you know through February I
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
suspect I think this is too early before
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
they you know they they do
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
meet the third the ground day too so
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
they'll know what the weather's like
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
right right right all right so you know
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
what is um does my inclination is to go
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
with the thir
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
third all right so that's what I'm
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm going to do and I'm
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to take a uh brief
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
recess while I get this to
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
uh while I get this to to Karen to uh
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%

District

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
19 um this bill is a is in a sense um
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
comes on a on a personal level uh I
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
didn't know how I was going to testify
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
on it today um this affects my family
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
and uh I basically you in the judicial
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
system I've seen firsthand so many
 
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
different things that are um broken and
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
this fixes it so currently
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
um this affects my daughter and we have
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
not had we haven't even had our initial
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so this won't even take effect
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
to um to help our family a a prosecutor
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
up north is the one that told me this
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
has been a problem for a long time and
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
this fixes it
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
so the person that was arrested in
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
regards with a sexual assault that took
 
01:38:11.709 --> 01:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
place um was arrested in the fall of
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
23 we still haven't even had our hearing
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
yet in District Court up North but after
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
we do which will be probably at some
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
point this spring
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
my daughter will have to go through it
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
all over
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
again and from the time that the assault
 
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.109 align:start position:0%
again and from the time that the assault
took

01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
took
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
place and then when it does go to
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
Superior Court because it will
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
definitely be appealed there's no doubt
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
um four or five years could have passed
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
that means all of the witnesses all of
 
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
that will all be done so um it just
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
penalizes victims
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
and um and it's it's absolutely
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that we would ever let
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
someone have to go through this uh twice
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
and I Tred to because there is a sort of
 
01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
a fix I guess that you could have so we
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
appealed to the county
 
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
attorney to try to get him to bypass the
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
district court to take the case he flat
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
out ignored every single
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
request email phone call
 
01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
so this bill has to pass it's why would
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
we ever have something where we're going
 
01:39:30.679 --> 01:39:31.550 align:start position:0%
we ever have something where we're going
to

01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
revictimized um
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
victims it's it's crazy so it doesn't
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
hurt at all that's still completely due
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
process and for someone that has been
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
um someone that has been arrested and
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're you know fighting of course for
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
their um if they believe that they're
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
innocent or all of that that it doesn't
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
change anything here it's just why would
 
01:39:59.589 --> 01:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
we ever go through this
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
twice so give the person that has been
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
charged the choice in the beginning and
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much it so if you have
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll answer them but this
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
is um this came to me because I realized
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
this loophole from a prosecutor up north
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh she explained um how we how to you
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
know she's like you should you should
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
hear leg legislator she file a bill and
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
because this affects you personally uh
 
01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
you can speak to it and so that's why
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%

I the public policy specialist at the
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%

Coalition serves um roughly 15,000
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
survivors across all of our 12 uh
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
community- based crisis centers in New
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including survivors of sexual
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
assault both adults and children um I'm
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
here to speak in support of this bill um
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
we really appreciate um what the sponsor
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
has brought forward the goals of this
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislation really recognizes the impact
 
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
our judicial process has on victims in
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of offenders in Domestic
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence cases often use the
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
court process to delay Justice and
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
further perpetuate abuse with the intent
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
to wear down the victim and hopes
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
they'll give up criminal proceedings in
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse cases can take years um and
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
as you've heard from the sponsor can be
 
01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:48.679 align:start position:0%
a really really trying experience for
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
families um the more time that passes
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
the more the lives of victims are
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
impacted Ed without the ability to move
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
forward and heal um passing this
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
legislation would help streamline and
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
improve what is already a daunting and
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
scary court process especially for minor
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual assault um as a state
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
we should do uh be doing everything we
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
can to support child survivors um and
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that offenders are held
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
accountable the traumatic nature of
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
sexual crimes against children can
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
prevent victims from coming forward and
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
even disclosing abuse I think most uh
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
when I share this statistic most people
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
are really a back but the median age
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
that a Child Survivor comes forward to
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
report their abuse is 52 um so the
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
lifetime impact of trauma can really
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
delay this process um so anything that
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
we can do to really ensure that we are
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
streamlining and closing loopholes in
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
our law that would prevent someone from
 
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
coming forward should really be
 
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
addressed um many people who were abused
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
as children report that they didn't know
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
that what was happening to them was
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
illegal um so we should also be um
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
supportive of survivors who are enough
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
to come forward and Report their abuse
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think especially just knowing
 
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people don't believe child
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
victims um and so that adds to the
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
daunting nature of this process um it
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
can leave victims feeling silenced
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
disheartened and alone to cope with the
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
aftermath of abuse whether facing
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
threats by offenders or disbelief from
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
family members victims are faced with a
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
double bind when it comes to disclosing
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
their abuse and then being able to go
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
through this process um the fact that
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
child survivors May face a second
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
criminal proceeding should the should
 
01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:29.719 align:start position:0%
the the first Lower Court decision be
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
appealed is devastating um this bill
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes how incredibly difficult it
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
is for child survivors to come forward
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
and is a small measure we can take to
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
limit the long-term trauma that
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
survivors experience and their families
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
um I ask the committee to please support
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill um and thank you so much

legislator I'm a sex I'm a Survivor of
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and I'm here today in
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
support of HB 369 when I was 14 I dated
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
someone who was 2 years older than me
 
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
who was possessive and controlling he
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
told me that since we were talking I
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't allowed to take talk to anyone
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
else I couldn't speak to other voice
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
boys he wouldn't take no for an answer
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
even when I would try to have a say he
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
would just ask me the same question in a
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
different way to get the answer he
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
wanted all while telling me he loved me
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
I can tell you it doesn't make it less
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
dramatic to get assaulted by someone who
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
says they love you it makes it worse in
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
addition to being victimized by the guy
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
was dating I was continuously silenced
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
ignored and abandoned by the people who
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
are supposed to help I was let down by
 
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:18.679 align:start position:0%
my guidance counselor our re our school
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
resource officer in the police
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
department instead of finding support I
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
was left feeling guilty embarrassed
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
ashamed and less than and I was only 14
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
years old I fought my way into the court
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
system only to be failed again all I
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
wanted was my voice to be heard for the
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
guy who assaults me to be held
 
01:45:36.189 --> 01:45:36.199 align:start position:0%
accountable for harming me and to have
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
some hope that his punishment would be
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
like my Justice instead I was denyed my
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
voice yet again and I would victimize
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
this time by the people who are supposed
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
to protect me and give me my Justice the
 
01:45:51.149 --> 01:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
process made me depressed suicidal and I
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
was bullied at school all why my abuser
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
continue to walk past me in the hallways
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
and laugh at me what he did affected my
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with my family my mental
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
health and I also now have difficulty
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
creating new friendship with boys I
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
distrust people and assume the worst
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
always wondering if their intentions are
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
real or fake I am a survivor I survive
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
my abuser I survive the court system and
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
I survive my trauma victims of sexual
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
assault have to live with what happened
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
to them for the rest of their lives what
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
happened to me and what has happened to
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
too many others in New Hampshire is
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
serious the the New Hampshire
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislator has an opportunity today to
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
support survivors like me and simplify a
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
process that is extremely ret
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
traumatizing I was committed to taking
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
my case as far as I need to but the
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
truth is most wouldn't testifying once
 
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
against someone who harmed you and
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
silenced you is a really difficult
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
experience having to do that and go
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
through the entire trial process all
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
over is something a lot of survivors
 
01:46:50.109 --> 01:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
might not have the strength to do and I
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't want them to Once is enough while
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
my case was resolved through a plea deal
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
it was no less grueling and antagonizing
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
I had to fight every step of the way to
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
be heard I felt powerless and I felt
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
like I didn't matter nobody deserved
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
this I don't want anyone to feel how I
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
felt as a young Survivor it's important
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
to me that we make a change I decided to
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
share my story with you today to be a
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
voice for other survivors who have been
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
failed by the justice system in their
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
communities I'm here to stand up for
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
those who can't stand up for themselves
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me he thank you
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
very much all right um thank you next
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
please good morning chairman ly members
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Steven
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
endris I'm an assistant County Attorney
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
at the maram county attorney's office
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
I've been a PR uter for um over 20 years
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
now I am in support of House Bill
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
369 and just to sort of start at the
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
beginning and maybe assume you're not
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the process what this bill
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
would do is in misdemeanor sexual
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
assault cases specifically brought under
 
01:48:11.199 --> 01:48:12.750 align:start position:0%
assault cases specifically brought under
RSA

01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.229 align:start position:0%
RSA
632

01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
632
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
um A4 I'm sorry misdemeanor sexual
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
assault cases normally would go forward
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
in circuit court because it's a class a
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and there's the potential
 
01:48:25.709 --> 01:48:25.719 align:start position:0%
for the person to go to jail if
 
01:48:27.550 --> 01:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
convicted under the New Hampshire
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution they have the right to a
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
jury trial unfortunately there's really
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
no mechanism in New Hampshire to get the
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
ma jury trial in the first instance so
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
the system we have in place is that if
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
you're convicted in Circuit Court you
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
can appeal to the superior court for a
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
denovo jury trial which means as if what
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
had happened in Circuit Court had never
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
happened the difficulty of course is
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
that we know testifying can be traumatic
 
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
especially for children and especially
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
in sexual assault cases so the way the
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
system is set up now you would have to
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a trial in Circuit Court testify in
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
circuit court and then if the
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
defendant's found guilty the defendant
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
could appeal for a denovo trial in
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where it would be a jury
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
trial and again you'd be called on to
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
testify a second
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
time and you'd obviously be exposed to
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
that same trauma of testifying fing
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
twice what this bill would do is have a
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
defendant charged with misdemeanor
 
01:49:31.950 --> 01:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault in Circuit Court make an
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
election early on whether or not they
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
want to go forward in circuit court and
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
wave the right to a jury trial or have
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
the case immediately appealed to
 
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
Superior Court for a jury trial in the
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
first instance um I do think this is a
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
good idea it would certainly limit the
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh the trauma that that victims are
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
facing as was mentioned earlier there is
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
a statute which allows cases to be
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
brought in the Superior Court in the
 
01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:58.830 align:start position:0%
brought in the Superior Court in the
first

01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
instance it's actually RSA 592
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
A1 and I certainly in my experience I
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
can think of at least one case where we
 
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
had a vulnerable victim in circuit court
 
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
and we brought it in Superior Court in
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
the first instance in order to avoid
 
01:50:17.109 --> 01:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
having to have this person testified
 
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
twice the difficulty with this the
 
01:50:23.629 --> 01:50:23.639 align:start position:0%
statute indicates that Superior Court
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
May dismiss a prosecution originally
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
begun which is within the jurisdiction
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the circuit court so in order to
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
bring these charges in the the Superior
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
Court in the first instance under the
 
01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.830 align:start position:0%
Court in the first instance under the
current

01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
statute the judge and Superior Court
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
could dismiss it at any time because
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's within the circuit Court's
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
Jurisdiction and sort of knock us back
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
to to circuit court so you have to have
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
Buy in from the Superior Court judges
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
which may be difficult when they have
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
their own busy f
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
dockets there is one small tweak I would
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
recommend on page
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
two lines 24 and 25 it says in a
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution for a violation of RSA 632
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
A4 involving a victim 16 years of age or
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
under at the time the prosecution is
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
commenced that phrase 16 years of age or
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
younger um I think becomes ambiguous and
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's actually some
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
interesting if you're ever interested in
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
doing legal research on this the the
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
states are about split 50/50 of what 16
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
years or age 16 years of age or under
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
actually means there's some people
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
that'll tell you until a person turns 17
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
they're 16 years of age or under there's
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
other people that will tell you if
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
you're 16 and a half you are not 16
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
years of age or under so there's a
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
question of 16 years of age or under
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
does that mean until your 16th birthday
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
or does that mean until your 17th
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
birthday um the Preamble on line 23 says
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
with victims less than 16 years of age
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
which I think is is better language if
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
you wanted to
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
clarify um victims less than 16 years of
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
age or victims less than 17 years of age
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
would make it clearer um who
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
specifically you're speaking
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
about other than that small uh Amendment
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
I have I I do support the bill and I'm
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
 
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:31.069 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
representative

01:52:31.069 --> 01:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um can you tell me the
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
18 I I think that's a policy decision
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the committee um the one thing I can
 
01:52:49.069 --> 01:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
indicate is that the misdemeanor sexual
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
assault statute does refer to persons
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
under 16
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
um in both
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
subsection B and
 
01:53:02.109 --> 01:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
C so that's the only thing I can think
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
of why 16 is being used instead of 18
 
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
could I ask one other question certainly
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you identify a very serious problem
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
um if you've been around for a while you
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
you saw the start and the end of the
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
felony first
 
01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.189 align:start position:0%
felony first
um

01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
experiment recognizing the same problem
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
of I mean
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
not this the problem of the
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
differentiation between the two
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
courts um if we were to pass
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
this are there other
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
examples that are there of the conflict
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court well the the circuit
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
court and the Superior Court as we have
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
now I think the answer is yes from from
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
my point of view um and going back even
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
further than felonies first at at one
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
point in the state we had what was
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
referred to as the jury trial project
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
and i' I am old enough that I remember
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
the jury trial project and got to
 
01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
participate in the jury trial project
 
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
where everyone who was charged with a
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor I know at least it
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
existed in both marac and Rockingham
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
County everyone who was charged with the
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor had to decide at
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
arraignment I think it was whether or
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
not they wanted a jury trial or a bench
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
trial and we were doing jury trials in
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
the first instance in um domestic
 
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
violence cases in DWI subsequent cases
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
in circuit courts or District Courts at
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
the time in I think Portsmith conquered
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think Derry had a a jury trial project
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
where we were doing jury trials in the
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
circuit courts to try and eliminate the
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
the two-tier system um the the that
 
01:55:06.239 --> 01:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
the two-tier system um the the that
two-tier

01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
two-tier
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
system has some inherent difficulties in
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and in my experience and I
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
can tell you the the first difficulty is
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
that you are having all Witnesses
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
essentially testify
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
twice uh that creates difficulties
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
because a lot of witnesses don't want to
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
be involved in the process to begin with
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
and they're being involved in the
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
process twice so it is a fairly major
 
01:55:34.069 --> 01:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
inconvenience for them
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
secondly one of the things that occurs
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
during cross-examination is you ask you
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
look for differences in people's
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
statements if you testify under oath and
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
defense Council has a transcript of that
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
and you testify a second time almost
 
01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
inevitably there's some minor difference
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
in perhaps what you said which can be
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
used to impeach you as a witness the the
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
third problem that I've always had with
 
01:56:05.069 --> 01:56:05.079 align:start position:0%
the the two-tier system is that we often
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
bring alternative Theory charges so for
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
example in a driving well intoxicated
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
case if a person agrees to a
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
breathalyzer test and is over
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
a08 we would charge two theories of
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
driving well intoxicated one that
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
they're under the influence and one that
 
01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
they have a blood alcohol concentration
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
over a
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
8 the difficulty is that in Circuit
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
Court when we have those trials a lot of
 
01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
Judges will find the person guilty of
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
one but not guilty of the other and as
 
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
soon as the judge in Circuit Court says
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
not guilty we can't bring that charge
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
again for the trial Den noo so we've
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
certainly had experiences where I I
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
personally had a case where an
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
individual was charged with both
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
stalking and Theft the court found him
 
01:56:56.189 --> 01:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
not stalking in what theft uh he had
 
01:56:59.790 --> 01:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
actually stolen the key to his former
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
girlfriend's apartment and had let
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
himself into the apartment a number of
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
times the judge in Circuit Court found
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
that I hadn't proven stalking Beyond A
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt and found him not
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
guilty of stalking but did find that he
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
had stolen the key to the apartment and
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
found him guilty of theft he appealed
 
01:57:19.229 --> 01:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
that to a jury trial and because he was
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
found not guilty of stalking we couldn't
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
talk about the fact that he was actually
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
using this stolen key to go in and out
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
of his girlfriend's apartment and it it
 
01:57:31.149 --> 01:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
just sort of leaves a lot of information
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
that is maybe relevant out of the
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
equation thank you very much other
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
CH yeah thanks and thanks for taking the
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm just curious because you
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the the misdemeanor sexual
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
assault statutes um and I notic in the
 
01:57:55.390 --> 01:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
language um on page one um in in the new
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
language we talk about the victim's age
 
01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
at the time prosecution is
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
commenced is that typically the standard
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious why it's when
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
prosecution is commen versus when the
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
when the assault took place I assume
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of this bill is to
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
prevent children from having to testify
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
twice and to prevent victims of sexual
 
01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
assault from having to testify twice
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
twice so I would presume that if for
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
example a person was a victim when they
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
were 15 years old but charges weren't
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
brought until they were 18 years old
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
when they were 18 I think the assumption
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
would be that they can handle testifying
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
twice or at least we willing to put them
 
01:58:45.069 --> 01:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
through that that trauma twice so I
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
again I think that's a policy decision
 
01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
up to to you guys whether you want it to
 
01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
be the age at the time the prosecution
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
is commenced or the age at the time of
 
01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:54.589 align:start position:0%
is commenced or the age at the time of
the

01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:58.510 --> 01:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
offense okay so so not your impression
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
even if it went forward the way it is it
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the standard of what the
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor sexual assault on a minor
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
would be at its core it changes it would
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
be a policy decision of whether this
 
01:59:13.030 --> 01:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
should be different than that standard
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
correct this wouldn't change the
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor sexual assault statute at
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
all it would change the process for
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
someone charged with misdemeanor sexual
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
assault whether they had had the chance
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
to have essentially two trials or
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
whether they elected to have either a
 
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
bench trial or a jury trial can I do one
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
more followup yes of course so I guess
 
01:59:37.709 --> 01:59:37.719 align:start position:0%
flipping it over do you see any problem
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
if this was to state that uh this is all
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
based on uh assault that happened when
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
the victim
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
was under under 16 or or 18 if it was
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
changed but under age at the the time
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
the assault took place versus the time
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
that the that the that the trial
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
commences I I don't see a problem with
 
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
that and the and the only I guess just
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but if you if
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
you changed it to the
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
time you made it hinge on the time of
 
02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:12.990 align:start position:0%
time you made it hinge on the time of
the

02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%
assault then I mean to carry your
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
example forward and I think there have
 
02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
been some cases like this if the witness
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
was now 35 right um you you would you
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
would this would you would this would
 
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
kick in and they would only have to
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
testify once and correct I mean I
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
suppose that could be the law but you
 
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
know that it would in other words if if
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's assaulted when let's say
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
they're 14 but the case isn't brought
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
until they're 35 and that can happen um
 
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that you know this I it
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that the same argument
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
of let's not yet let a young victim have
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
to testify twice doesn't apply if at the
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
time the person's testifying there's 35
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
that that's that would be my only
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
concern about that where whereas the way
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
it's worded it it's uh it is limited to
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
somebody that's young at the time of
 
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to testify I
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
I agree what you just said is very
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
accurate other other questions yes
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
02:01:18.430 --> 02:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
was confused by something that I thought
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
you said which is you were describing
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
the process for going to Superior Court
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
and you discussed Superior Court judges
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
kicking the case back to the um circuit
 
02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
court and I was but if the defendant has
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
elected a jury trial and therefore is
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to be in Superior Court how what's
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
the Authority for the judge to kick it
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
back to the Circuit Court right I so if
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's an appeal to Superior Court the
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
judge can't kick it back to Circuit
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
Court if it's initiated in Superior
 
02:01:54.030 --> 02:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
Court in the first instance but it's
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
within the jurisdiction of the circuit
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
court and and again the the example that
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
I had was we had an individual in
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
conquered who was
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
assaulted um and was developmentally
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
delayed and we brought those charges in
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in the first instance
 
02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
even though they were misdemeanors
 
02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
because we felt like this person
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't going to be able to
 
02:02:20.589 --> 02:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
testify twice to begin with um in order
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
to do that though you have to get Buy in
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
from the superior court and it's sort of
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
a a once in a great while that I think
 
02:02:32.069 --> 02:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
we can bring misdemeanors in Superior
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
instance yes follow up I I'm just
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
curious where you successful in that in
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
that case so I was involved in the
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court aspect of it my
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
recollection is that a number of people
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
were convicted in Superior Court of um
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
assaulting this young man other
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh I'm sorry
 
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.430 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh I'm sorry
representative

02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
BRD thank you Mr
 
02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
chair I just had a question I didn't see
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
anything in here as far as assistance
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
for folks that I don't know if that
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit here but as far as
 
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
assistance Medical Care whatnot or just
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
to be assigned a I don't know a
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
psychologist or whatnot but I'm just
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
curious why if you feel like that kind
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
of language would
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
um help a defendant
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
or that wouldn't necessarily be in in in
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
this statute I think there's certainly
 
02:03:34.629 --> 02:03:34.639 align:start position:0%
um a restitution statute that talks
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
about uh costs in terms
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
of psychological care after care that
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
type of thing um I think they kind of go
 
02:03:45.629 --> 02:03:45.639 align:start position:0%
together really but and I I certainly
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with that
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
but it to me it makes more sense to be
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
in the rest of restitution statute
 
02:03:55.629 --> 02:03:55.639 align:start position:0%
because that applies to all crimes with
 
02:03:59.069 --> 02:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
victims um and certainly you can have
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
restitution with with multiple
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
crimes representative Morton you had a
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
question yeah so um what you were
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
speaking on the chair about thank you
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the uh question here
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
um this wouldn't apply to cases like
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
what's going on YDC for example because
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the length of time it's been and so
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
forth for a number reasons yes right so
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
the the wording of this couldn't be
 
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
changed but by this passing that could
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
open the door for Expediting Expediting
 
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
situation if so if this passed I don't
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
think this would have any
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
impact you know sort of on on what's
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
going on with YDC um if if this passed
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you had a misdemeanor sexual assault
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
at for example YDC and the victim was
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
still under the age of uh 16 or 17
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
however you word that this would then
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
apply and they'd have to elect either
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
have the circuit court trial or the jury
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
trial okay so a followup to that if this
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
passed another bill could be placed that
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
would be based on this but
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
including the cases that are years
 
02:05:18.669 --> 02:05:18.679 align:start position:0%
later potentially you could or you could
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
amend this to to change the age to the
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
time of the offense okay thank you all
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
right any other questions for this WT
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you know representative pens could
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
I could I just ask you to come up for
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
one one second
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
um Mr Anders the witnesses just has
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
raises a very valid point I think um
 
02:05:43.709 --> 02:05:43.719 align:start position:0%
there is some ambiguity to the way the
 
02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
the um 16 years of age or under is yeah
 
02:05:52.589 --> 02:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
lines 23 and 24 and so
 
02:05:55.709 --> 02:05:55.719 align:start position:0%
um I guess the question would be I mean
 
02:05:59.229 --> 02:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
we could because the way it's now worded
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically somebody you you could be
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
read to be some that doesn't apply until
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's turned 17 so I mean are you
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
do you have a preference of
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
to thank you so much uh chairman Lynn I
 
02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
was going to ask to come up again too
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
because it was you know this was um of
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
course put together um through the
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
lawyers down in OSS and um I believe
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
that and and he could maybe back me up
 
02:06:27.390 --> 02:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
or you could so line
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
23 if that just changes to less than 17
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
years of age then it fixes it it you're
 
02:06:36.669 --> 02:06:36.679 align:start position:0%
right no you're absolutely right it does
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
and you would be comfortable with that
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
yes I would be okay all right
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
um yes of course representative katat
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
chairman ly so for clarification
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
purposes if we said less than 17 that
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
would be at the time that the initial
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
proceedings that the that the person was
 
02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
charged because we're hearing that
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes this takes a really long time
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
to go through and so I'd want to make
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
sure that let's say the person was
 
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
arrested when the victim was under 17
 
02:07:07.069 --> 02:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
but then it took three years for the
 
02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
case to get to trial
 
02:07:12.069 --> 02:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
would i' I'd still want it to apply in
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
that case so would it be from the time
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
person how would that work it says well
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
it says at the time the prosecution is
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
commenced so you know uh I mean that
 
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:26.679 align:start position:0%
would be that would be an an issue I I
 
02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
would say normally it would be the time
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
that the complaint is filed in the is
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
first filed in court so if it um if it's
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
first if the person is under 17 at the
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
time that the complaint is first filed
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
in court then it would it would apply um
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
if it took and so if it took you know a
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
long period of time uh to get to get to
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
even a trial in the district where I
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
think it would still apply the person
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
would have to make the
 
02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
election could I speak to this real
 
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
quick sure okay cuz uh representative
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
cutab you missed um the attorney that
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
spoke on this so it actually wouldn't
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
apply so um I didn't think I was going
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
to be so emotional today so the assault
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
that took place with my daughter
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
happened in
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
22 uh the person wasn't arrested until
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
23 the assault that happened on my
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
daughter she was 14 she's now
 
02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.390 align:start position:0%
daughter she was 14 she's now
17

02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
17
 
02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
so as time goes it's really hard with
 
02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and all these other types of
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
things and um and I don't know if this
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
person's going to be brought to justice
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
but it's this thing that's just hanging
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
over us CU we haven't even had our first
 
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
trial yet so um I understand where
 
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but the bill as
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
written does not so let's say if this
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
was in place now and my daughter because
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
she turns um my daughter turn she's 16
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
now and she turns 17 um at the end of
 
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
March uh if another years goes by then
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply to her and maybe
 
02:09:05.310 --> 02:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's another bite at the Apple at some
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
point in time but I really want to fix
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
what I can right now and to answer your
 
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
question representative Morton this
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
really this applies for misdemeanor so
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
the cases with YDC are full-blown felony
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
charges so um in my case it could have
 
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
been a felony but uh she ran away so I
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
just um I really want to fix this and my
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
daughter had this snow day today and um
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
she didn't want to come and I really
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
wanted her to speak so I I just want to
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank the other victim that came up to
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
speak because this has been really
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
really hard for our family all right
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much man all right oh I'm
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
sorry representative tur do you have a
 
02:09:52.990 --> 02:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah and first let me say sorry
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
for for whatever your uh your family has
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
suffered and uh I I just on this point
 
02:10:01.549 --> 02:10:01.559 align:start position:0%
about the the date of the offense versus
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
the date of the
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
trial do is is there a reason why you
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
think it would be problematic to set it
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
back to the date of the offense so that
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
it would cover a broader group of people
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
and and in my mind I'm thinking not ret
 
02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:17.549 align:start position:0%
and and in my mind I'm thinking not ret
traumatize

02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
traumatize
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
victims um
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
who who make may be older now but are
 
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
still talking about a a trauma when they
 
02:10:25.079 --> 02:10:26.030 align:start position:0%
still talking about a a trauma when they
were

02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
younger I agree and I think that would
 
02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:31.639 align:start position:0%
be great it's just right now how the
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor statute is it goes based
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
upon that age and so that's why how the
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill was organized I don't know if it
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
would the language wise legally e and
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative ly you could maybe speak
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
to this you're a lawyer or judge you I
 
02:10:50.109 --> 02:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
mean you know this stuff more than I do
 
02:10:52.109 --> 02:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
um this was the way we could handle it
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
at first but I I understand what you're
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
saying I don't know if that would
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change one the support for
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
the Coalition um and I don't want
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
anybody to be revictimized twice and as
 
02:11:07.629 --> 02:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
time goes on like I said it's really
 
02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
hard for these cases to um to be proven
 
02:11:16.589 --> 02:11:16.599 align:start position:0%
um if it wouldn't fundamentally um hurt
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
the bill or um you know um imp its
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
progress or passage I'd be okay with it
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
but um if it would if it if it would
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
then I'd like to keep it the way it is
 
02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:32.559 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for this
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:11:38.589 --> 02:11:38.599 align:start position:0%
any I'm sorry represent Smith I don't
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
have a question for the for the witness
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I have a question for you as chair of
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee and I see
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in the audience and now I
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
understand not for this bill but for the
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
next bill um our colleague who chaired
 
02:12:01.229 --> 02:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
um the special committee on the Circuit
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
Court um I sit here and listen to this
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um I don't think the word horrified
 
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
is too strong a word for me to use
 
02:12:21.629 --> 02:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
thinking about how the structure itself
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
of the relationship between the circuit
 
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
court and the Superior
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
meet the appropriate judicial
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
requirements of the citizens of the
 
02:12:43.390 --> 02:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
state um I don't see this as a problem
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
that relates only to juveniles I see it
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
as it relates to people who are older
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't and and
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
this whole lack of I think there's a I
 
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
think there might be a lack of
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate division of responsibilities
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
between the circuit court and the
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
superior court and at some point I would
 
02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
like wiser heads than mine to be able to
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at this at this issue and
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
see if we ought to consider some
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
fundamental changes and I don't expect
 
02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:21.559 align:start position:0%
you to respond although I would love to
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
hear your response but I'm very
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about what we've all just
 
02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
heard it doesn't seem right to me well I
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
guess what I I guess what I would say is
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
is this I mean I I think that you rais a
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate question but it seems to me
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
that that's I mean we're not going to
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not going to be able to
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
get an amendment to this bill for
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
example that would you know that that
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
might well be something that would be uh
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know appropriate for some some
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
further legislation in the future or
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
some further study but I don't think it
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
AG I don't think we can do anything
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
about thank you for indulging no for
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
sure is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
be heard on SB uh HB
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%

say something
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
hit that red button so we hit the button
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we get the red there you go yes okay
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
um hi again I just wanted to say
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%

passed I'm really urging you guys to
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%

on Tuesdays a year and a half ago

the National Alliance for the mentally
 
02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
ill asked if I would work with her on
 
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
legislation having to do with
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
restoration of Competency for those
 
02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
accused of a crime it is a fundamental
 
02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional right that people be able
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
to assist in their own defense but some
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
people are found to be not competent to
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
do that Most states have programs in
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
place to help people come to competency
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which tends to be first in
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
some things and last in many other
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
things is not one of those States as a
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
result while 70 to 80% of the people in
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
those states that helped them come to
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
competency the rate in New Hampshire
 
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
where it's run along now good luck is
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
30% a bill was filed to establish a
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
bamal and bipartisan committee to study
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the matter representative tah served
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
on that committee we heard from members
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary from various mental
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
health organizations DHHS Behavioral
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
Health division New Hampshire hospital
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
we looked at a sampling of what other
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
states did well it's been asked why
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
would you want to help people be able to
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
be competent which means now they got to
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
go to trial well the answer is
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
severalfold and again remember this is
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
red States and blue States doing this
 
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
and they've answered the question we do
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
this first because it gives closure to
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
the alleged
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
victims a decision one way or the other
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
has been made by the court and now life
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
can go on
 
02:18:23.549 --> 02:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
we've heard from people where there was
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
not a decision not a decision and
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're hanging in there without closure
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
it also gives closure to the alleged
 
02:18:33.629 --> 02:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
perpetrator that person could be found
 
02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
not guilty but even if the person were
 
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.830 align:start position:0%
not guilty but even if the person were
found

02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
found
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
guilty sometimes the sentence that's
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
given out is less than that person
 
02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
bouncing around all for the mental
 
02:18:45.559 --> 02:18:48.190 align:start position:0%
bouncing around all for the mental
health

02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:49.709 align:start position:0%
 
system

02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
also although it doesn't happen every
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
time when a person is undergoing the
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
kind of counseling that would assist him
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
or her to come to
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
competency it may be helpful in other
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
areas where that person suffers from
 
02:19:05.319 --> 02:19:07.589 align:start position:0%
areas where that person suffers from
mental

02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
mental
 
02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
issues our committee came to several
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
conclusions number one it's generally
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
considered that an intentional program
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
of assisting in restoration is a good
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
thing second we found that having a
 
02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
forensic liaison person would be very
 
02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
advantageous this person would be
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
appointed to assist the person coming to
 
02:19:35.549 --> 02:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
competency if they're having issues
 
02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
which keep them from competency they
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
probably will have issues in showing up
 
02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
to appointments whether that be in the
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
court or a counselor or what have you
 
02:19:47.790 --> 02:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
and this becomes a financial problem
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
because it costs just as much to have
 
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
the the heat on and the lights on and
 
02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
the staff present and the building
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
rented if a patient doesn't show up then
 
02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
if the patient does well we don't want
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
to waste that money we want to make sure
 
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
that the individual goes to hearings
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
02:20:09.389 --> 02:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
appointments and the forensic liaison
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
person will assist in that that forensic
 
02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
liaison person will also be the one who
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
will find out amongst the various
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
counseling programs and Community Mental
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
Health places what programs are
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with what other states are
 
02:20:28.399 --> 02:20:30.190 align:start position:0%
consistent with what other states are
using

02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
also we were convinced that the agency
 
02:20:33.359 --> 02:20:34.910 align:start position:0%
also we were convinced that the agency
overseeing

02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
this should not be in the judicial
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
branch because we don't want this to be
 
02:20:43.389 --> 02:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
seen so much as a juridical matter
 
02:20:46.349 --> 02:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
although a judge eventually will have to
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
render a verdict on competency we wanted
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
to see this as a mental health thing we
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to help people that was the
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
purpose so we thought DHHS would be the
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
best place to oversee it well our
 
02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee worked hard we learned much we
 
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
talked to a lot of people and then we
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
were up at the deadline of Bill filing
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
so the bill that you had before you that
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
you probably have read over was put in
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
placeholder the amendment 00 61h which
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
has been passed around is the replace
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
all Amendment let me say a few things
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
about how that came to be I called
 
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
together an ad hoc Gathering of
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
individuals people from agencies and
 
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
bureaus and departments that would
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
actually be responsible for doing this
 
02:21:39.309 --> 02:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
we had people from the Judiciary would
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do work would the
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
judges see that this is something in the
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire akin to what other judges are
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
finding across the country
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
we would uh we also invited people from
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire hospital from local
 
02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
mental health organizations from
 
02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
dhss we invited a bunch of people and
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we crafted was a
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
joint project that everybody liked now
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
certain ones may not yet be ready to
 
02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:14.910 align:start position:0%
certain ones may not yet be ready to
endorse

02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
endorse
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
it for the simple reason it does not yet
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note it will when I I
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
talked to the budget people they said no
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
it's got to go through the process here
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
then should it pass here off it will go
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
to get a fiscal
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
note I have been I was actually called
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
by the governor remember she was a
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general and cares very much
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
about this issue she called me to say
 
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
we'll make it work financially we'll
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
figure it out so you don't have a fiscal
 
02:22:50.030 --> 02:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
note you may not have a endorsement in
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
this hearing but I will tell you that
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment you're looking at is the
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment all of the stakeholders worked
 
02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:58.670 align:start position:0%
amendment all of the stakeholders worked
on

02:22:58.670 --> 02:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:23:00.910 --> 02:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
together and I'll be happy to take any
 
02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
questions you might have questions for
 
02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.429 align:start position:0%
questions you might have questions for
this

02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:07.150 --> 02:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
02:23:10.030 --> 02:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm GNA call on I'm sorry
 
02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I'm sorry it's
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
more of a procedural question for for
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
you I believe um since what's before us
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
right now is just the original bill
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
which has no content I'm wondering when
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to offer the
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
amendment well what what I I mean I was
 
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask I somebody on the
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee has to offer the amendment and
 
02:23:31.389 --> 02:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
I was certainly prepared to do that but
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
if representative tur if you're prepared
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
that once we hear the by leave Mr
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I asked him to do it because he
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
was on that committee oh oh that's fine
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
sure no no I would definitely um so we
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
will I mean we will get the amendment
 
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
before the committee for sure I just uh
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do that until we're
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
ready to exec but for sure that the
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll get before the uh we'll
 
02:23:52.439 --> 02:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll get before the uh we'll
get

02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
before except Mr chair that if for
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
example there might be an opportunity to
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
um make improvements in the amendment
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
that might have come up since chairman
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh drafted this um wouldn't it
 
02:24:18.110 --> 02:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
be helpful if it could be introduced
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
today by a member of the committee
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps even
 
02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:25.910 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps even
addressed

02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
and if there were to be changes those
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
could be proposed in time for an
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
ultimate executive session yeah no no

I'm sorry I I didn't I wasn't saying
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
that I I agree with what you're
 
02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting all I'm saying is I would
 
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
rather I'd like to hear from the other
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um and then you know at at the
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
end of that well uh consider the
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
amendment for sure but I I I hear what
 
02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
please good morning again my name is
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
Steven Andis I'm an assistant County
 
02:25:10.990 --> 02:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney at the Marat County Attorney's
 
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
Office I've been a prosecutor for over
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
20 years I haven't seen the amendment
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly Echo the sentiment
 
02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
that competency and restoration are
 
02:25:22.349 --> 02:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
serious issues in New Hampshire and the
 
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
system we currently have in place
 
02:25:25.630 --> 02:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be working at all
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of restoration and I
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
say that because there really is no
 
02:25:33.150 --> 02:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
system in place for restoration so
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
something has to be done thank you all
 
02:25:37.389 --> 02:25:37.399 align:start position:0%

02:26:28.990 --> 02:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of the amendment as well
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
I um helped work on the amendment with
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Pearson um as you've heard
 
02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire lacks any formal
 
02:26:40.030 --> 02:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
competency restoration program uh
 
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
currently and Nationwide about 81% of
 
02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
individuals are restored and in
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
2019 we restored um 44% of our
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
folks if somebody is not restored within
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
a year those charges are then dropped
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
and as you heard chairman Pearson
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
mention that you know not only um are
 
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
you talking about the person who is um
 
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
on trial there in a lot of those cases
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
is somebody on the other side who may
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
have experienced a traumatic um crime
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
against them and they are not able to
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
receive clo Ure if the person is never
 
02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
restored and additionally as you heard
 
02:27:28.269 --> 02:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
the person may not get their day in
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
court which is a right for folks to be
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
able to go to court and defend
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and there are folks that
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to defend
 
02:27:37.710 --> 02:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
themselves I mean a lot of people think
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know why would you want to be
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
restored it means you actually have to
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
go to trial well we heard from um a
 
02:27:48.429 --> 02:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
psychologist Dr bomersbach um when this
 
02:27:50.469 --> 02:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
committee was
 
02:27:53.950 --> 02:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh contemplating House Bill 1020 last
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
year um and he mentioned that he works
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
for the office of Fric examiners and
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
there are folks that he has examined
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
that he believes might be able to
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
actually show that they are not guilty
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so being able to have your day in
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
court is really important for these
 
02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
folks and without any kind of formal
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
competency restoration it's impossible
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
for them to do
 
02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
that um in Nami New Hampshire's
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
experience um we've we've worked with a
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
lot of families who see this as a missed
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity they see that their loved
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
ones are brought into the justice system
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
and there is no treatment they're just
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
basically told go get restored and
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're on their own to do that we know
 
02:28:37.630 --> 02:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a Workforce shortage here
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's a mental health crisis and folks
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't even know how to navigate the
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
system in order to be able to get
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
themselves services to even try to get
 
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
restored if they wanted
 
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
to um as a result of that folks end up
 
02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
um again in the criminal justice system
 
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
they end up potentially homeless and um
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
have other negative
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes the legislative study committee
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
as you heard Le heard from a lot of
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including um attorney
 
02:29:09.990 --> 02:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
Michael Grandy of the Attorney General's
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
office attorney gry reported to that
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee on the work of a competency
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the governor's advisory
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
Commission on mental illness in the
 
02:29:20.990 --> 02:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
correction system
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
he reported that the subcommittee Met
 
02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
for over a year and although all the
 
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
members agreed that a forensic leaon
 
02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
program was appropriate they could not
 
02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
decide um or come to consensus on what
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
that should look like which is why um
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire requested that study
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee um last year so that the
 
02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
legislature could take a look at all of
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
it and they could make decisions about
 
02:29:47.469 --> 02:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
what kind of a competency restoration
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
program we should have in the state of
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
as you heard after the interim report
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
which had a lot of recommendations on it
 
02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
I encourage all of you to take a look at
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
it one of those was the forensic leaz on
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
program um a group of stakeholders met
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
and um talked about a forensic liaison
 
02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
program which
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
is the amendment that you see in front
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
of you that was the the work product
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
that came out of that the forensic leaon
 
02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
under the pilot program would act as
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
intensive case managers link individuals
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
with Services they need to restore their
 
02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
competency and to assist in reducing any
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:34.510 --> 02:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
place when uh the legislative committee
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
study committee met they heard from Dr
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
Shannon Bader who was a forensic
 
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
psychologist who previously worked at
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's office of forensic
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
examiners and she provided testimony
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
that in her
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
experience many individuals who raise
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
competency have psychotic symptoms who
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
once treated with antis psychotic
 
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
medications later have their competency
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
restored and that's why you know when we
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
looked at where this forensically aison
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
program should go um our recommendation
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
as na New Hampshire was the Department
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services because
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
largely a line share of these folks need
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
treatment um it's less less of them need
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
education about the legal system and
 
02:31:19.269 --> 02:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
most of them need treatment a majority
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
of them I said have psychotic symptoms
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
and with the proper medication and the
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
proper mental health treatment they are
 
02:31:28.830 --> 02:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
re You Know M Ste I I don't mean to can
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
I just ask is it is as far as you know
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
based upon the testimony of the prior
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
witness and now um yourself is there any
 
02:31:41.309 --> 02:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to this it
 
02:31:44.590 --> 02:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like you know I mean you you you
 
02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
you've made a very persuasive you and
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson have made a very
 
02:31:49.389 --> 02:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
persuasive case at least to me and I I'm
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
just wondering is there some it it's
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
about the money so I'm we're just trying
 
02:31:57.070 --> 02:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
to you know I know that you are the
 
02:31:59.750 --> 02:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
policy committee and I understand that
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
but eventually you're going to have to
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
vote on the money too so
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I and I just wanted to
 
02:32:10.269 --> 02:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
just mention that um in the Senate
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
there's another companion bill to this
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill around um looking at some charges
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
that could be potentially dismissed if
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
the court um deemed um
 
02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:25.479 align:start position:0%
it appropriate for violation level
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
offenses and low-level misdemeanors that
 
02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
are of non the non-violent type um in
 
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
order to help facilitate because we've
 
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
found that people don't show up for that
 
02:32:38.590 --> 02:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
initial forensic Le forensic examination
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
thus costing the state more money and so
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
the forensic Liaisons would be involved
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
when competency is raised not when
 
02:32:49.389 --> 02:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
competency is not when they're found to
 
02:32:52.269 --> 02:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
be not competent so that they could help
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
get them to that initial examination to
 
02:32:57.269 --> 02:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
begin with and so just to wrap up for
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
those reasons we support the bill and we
 
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
support the amendment and we appreciate
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%

of HB 480 DHHS participated in the study

conversations about the pilot
 
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
program we believe this is an important
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
time for stakeholders to come together
 
02:34:21.269 --> 02:34:21.279 align:start position:0%

programmatic design and collaboration
 
02:34:26.469 --> 02:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
necessary to advance any new model thank

you be happy to take any questions
 
02:34:31.950 --> 02:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon Aon krian general
 
02:34:46.429 --> 02:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
counsel for the judicial branch um I
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
compliment chairman Pearson because he
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
brings so many people together when he
 
02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
works on an issue uh he was kind enough
 
02:34:54.830 --> 02:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
to bring uh the judicial branch as well
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
as DHHS uh the governor's subcommittee
 
02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
on competency a number of experts uh
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
different legislators to look at what
 
02:35:07.070 --> 02:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
has been a long running and incal
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
intractable intractable problem uh in
 
02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh which is uh which has
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
really sty the work of the governor
 
02:35:16.269 --> 02:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I think they have really
 
02:35:18.590 --> 02:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
struggled to to chart a particular path
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
forward on on improving competency
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh we do not have a formalized
 
02:35:27.070 --> 02:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
competency restoration process in New
 
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a 12-month period
 
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
provided by Statute but not necessarily
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
a program there are other states that
 
02:35:36.870 --> 02:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
have um either a department of forensic
 
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
Sciences or or a committed um part of
 
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
their DHHS which specifically works on
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
this issue that's that's just not
 
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
something that we have in New Hampshire
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the governor subcommittee did come to
 
02:35:52.190 --> 02:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
a conclusion that a forensic liaison was
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
a first step toward moving forward even
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
then there was a robust debate about
 
02:35:59.630 --> 02:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
what the duties and and and operations
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
of that person or that office should be
 
02:36:05.070 --> 02:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
um through a lot of work by the
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
Legislative subcommittee members
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
including those present in this room um
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
and others working on this replace all
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh it does seem that there is
 
02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
a potential pilot program that is a path
 
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
forward in what has been a very
 
02:36:19.630 --> 02:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
difficult area um and I also have to
 
02:36:21.950 --> 02:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
complement DHHS with the seriousness and
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
thoroughness which with which they have
 
02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
looked at um assuming potentially a
 
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
little more responsibility in this area
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
to that has been so challenging um for
 
02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
someone to to chart a path forward in I
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
I think that they have brought an
 
02:36:36.110 --> 02:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly robust look at what they can
 
02:36:37.630 --> 02:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
do and what they think they can improve
 
02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
in the in the situation that is very
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
impressive to me and I think it will be
 
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
to you as well uh so I I wanted to take
 
02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have about how
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
competency works now or any questions
 
02:36:48.910 --> 02:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
you have about how it implements uh
 
02:36:51.870 --> 02:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
within the judici to have this change um
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
but if you have no questions for me I'm
 
02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
also happy to questions for this witness
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none all right uh I don't is
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%

representative trip right there right
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.630 --> 02:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
hi good morning everyone um my name is
 
02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
Janelle llant I
 
02:37:30.510 --> 02:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
am a prospective graduate student I've
 
02:37:32.429 --> 02:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
been applying to PHD programs for
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
forensic psychology but I worked for
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
almost four years at the AA psychiatric
 
02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
Institute and about a year and a half on
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
the forensic competency restoration unit
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
um and have done a fair amount of review
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
as it um pertains to the research
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
literature on competency restoration um
 
02:37:49.550 --> 02:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I did want to speak to a
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with someone in
 
02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
Colorado this morning um who and I want
 
02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
to mention that Colorado was
 
02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned um Dr Sharon
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
Bader who's a friends of psychologist
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um who testified
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
attorney Stevens men mentioned her um Dr
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
Bader had spoken to how Colorado
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
specifically has done some tremendous
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
work in the competency restoration space
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so I was very fortunate to connect
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
with someone who works for the Colorado
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
district court this morning and asked
 
02:38:18.630 --> 02:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
him a few questions about competency
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
Restoration in Colorado
 
02:38:21.389 --> 02:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
and what I would specifically like to
 
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
highlight to the committee is the um
 
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
kind of their equivalent of the forensic
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
wayon program there they have two um and
 
02:38:34.269 --> 02:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
he very strongly spoke to the advantages
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
of having those staff and specifically
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
said um out of the two programs one of
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
them specifically that competency ra
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
restoration that it made all the
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
difference to have those essentially
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
Navigators um and helping to address the
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
underlying needs at some of these these
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
folks have um things like housing
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
getting a job addressing substance use
 
02:38:57.630 --> 02:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
Mental Health um and was just very
 
02:38:59.469 --> 02:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
strong about the difference that those
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
staff members made in the differences of
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
the lives of folks who are up for
 
02:39:05.150 --> 02:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
competency restoration um so I
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
specifically wanted to highlight that
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
for the committee this morning all right
 
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
great questions for this witness seeing
 
02:39:12.950 --> 02:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
none thank you very
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
much so um I know we we we're very short
 
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
on time we have to be over to the to the
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
state house but and I know that this
 
02:39:26.190 --> 02:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Pearson uh
 
02:39:28.349 --> 02:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
prepared was was just recently
 
02:39:31.110 --> 02:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
distributed however I've had a chance to
 
02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
look at it I believe representative tur
 
02:39:35.269 --> 02:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
has had a chance to look at
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
it it seems like this is something that
 
02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
has been very thoroughly vetted by
 
02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and the and the
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
working group um and I think that there
 
02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
is some there is an interest not only
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
for the people who for represented
 
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
Pearson and his group but I would
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
suggest it's also an an our interest to
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
try to get as many matters out of the
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
way and moved on because this will end
 
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
up going to finance at some point as
 
02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.389 align:start position:0%
up going to finance at some point as
possible

02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm I would propose to exec
 
02:40:14.349 --> 02:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
this now I would I I would propose to
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
tur move the amendment and then then
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
exect this now uh but if there's again
 
02:40:25.230 --> 02:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do it if people have a
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you chairman Lynn since this
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
is my first term on Judiciary this is a
 
02:40:37.309 --> 02:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
subject that I'm not overly familiar
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
with and I would be more comfortable
 
02:40:41.110 --> 02:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
voting once I have a little more time to
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
vet this issue nope NOP no problem no
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's a re very reasonable request no
 
02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
problem yes representative Manos I just
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask a question about the lack
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
of fiscal note and how that gets how
 
02:40:56.269 --> 02:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
that gets dealt with or impacts us
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's that I'm I'm I'm a little
 
02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:00.439 align:start position:0%
bit curious about that myself
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson but uh oh oh well
 
02:41:08.269 --> 02:41:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
it I I I share that thought but I called
 
02:41:14.990 --> 02:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
the budget people and they said we've
 
02:41:17.150 --> 02:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
got a hearing on the 28th and there
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
isn't a fiscal note and I want one and
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
they said ' have you ever done this
 
02:41:23.429 --> 02:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
before and I said ' no and they said
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
some other things that were encouraging
 
02:41:28.950 --> 02:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
but they said it has to come out of here
 
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then they'll do a fiscal note and
 
02:41:34.990 --> 02:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
then it will come back to the house with
 
02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
it I do not understand how they work I
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
am just told they are not going to do it
 
02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
until it comes out of here so you know I
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
just just should know I I had thought
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
until I just looked up the schedule I
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
got from Paul this is not listed as an
 
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
early bill it's not listed as an early
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill so I you
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
know as I say I I don't may represent
 
02:42:00.750 --> 02:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
Smith can you ask can you put any more
 
02:42:03.550 --> 02:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh give us any more information on this
 
02:42:08.030 --> 02:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
well I I think I can um in fact they
 
02:42:12.190 --> 02:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
cannot do a fiscal note on it until
 
02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's gone the next step and that is
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
the routine would be if we accept the
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and passed the bill as amended
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
it would then generate a fiscal note um
 
02:42:30.309 --> 02:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
that would not change the status of the
 
02:42:34.030 --> 02:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill it's not still not an early
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
bill um I uh they will go and do the
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note meanwhile there are a couple
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
of other things that will happen the
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
first thing that will happen is if this
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill then passes the house as it is this
 
02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know the fiscal note may or may not
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
be ready it doesn't make any difference
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
because for those of you who are paying
 
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
attention there's almost no chance that
 
02:43:07.429 --> 02:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
any new money is going to be identified
 
02:43:11.269 --> 02:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
in the house so it's irrelevant um it
 
02:43:14.110 --> 02:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
will however have a fison on on it by
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
the time it goes to the Senate and then
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate can add it
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
to um uh to the budget Bill uh which is
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
what's going to have to happen not
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
adding it to this bill but to the budget
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill and the other thing that can happen
 
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
is um because of chairman Pearson's
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
great skill and chairman Lynn's great
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
skill um if we get it through the house
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
um early enough chairman Lynn and
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
chairman PE will talk
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
to um let's see that would be chair well
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's confusing it will be
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
either either uh Maguire or Edwards
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
depending on whether it's going to go to
 
02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
division no it won't go to division one
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
because it won't go to Judiciary it will
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
go to division three Edwards and they on
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
their own can put it in so we don't have
 
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
to worry about it in other words we have
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
to worry about the policy and it's up to
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
um the finance committee to make it work
 
02:44:27.630 --> 02:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
or not and they're going to have a hard
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
time making it work but they might very
 
02:44:31.389 --> 02:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
well particularly if it's not an
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
enormous cost chairman Pearson has
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
already had lengthy conversations with
 
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh Finance 3 representative wer and with
 
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
Finance chairman W uh Edwards and
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
chairman Wier have had these
 
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
conversations all right thank you all
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
right so I guess what I would say then
 
02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
is um it I we won't exec this today but
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
this might be one of the bills U that
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
you consider during the time I'm away
 
02:44:59.710 --> 02:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
exec because it sounds like I mean once
 
02:45:02.030 --> 02:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pell has had a chance to
 
02:45:03.630 --> 02:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
familiarize herself with it and the rest
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
of and it'll give everyone else a chance
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
to look at the amendment more carefully
 
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
I don't we could even do it on Monday
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
well that's possible we might even be
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to do it on Monday that's a like
 
02:45:15.309 --> 02:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's a very good point anyway
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
um I I think that this would be
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
something that it would be in everyone's
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
to try to get this down move this down
 
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
the road and uh maybe we can do that
 
02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do it on Monday um with
 
02:45:30.670 --> 02:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
that um I'm going to recess
 
02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:32.269 align:start position:0%
that um I'm going to recess
uh

02:45:32.269 --> 02:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
oh so yeah so
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I I I guess sure do we not
 
02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment when we're
 
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
voting on the bill or do we this is
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
testimony right now until we adopt the
 
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment when we vote on it right so
 
02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
you know I think I think technically
 
02:45:55.950 --> 02:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong representative
 
02:45:59.389 --> 02:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
Smith I should open a brief executive
 
02:46:02.230 --> 02:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
session to allow representative tur to
 
02:46:04.830 --> 02:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment I'll second it
 
02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
then I'll recess the executive session
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
um uh until you closed have you closed
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
the area I I don't think I have closed
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
hear no I don't think that I think I
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't we have to do that
 
02:46:21.550 --> 02:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
main amendment I think that as long as
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
the hearing still open representative T
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
can now introduce this amendment we okay
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to go to any executive
 
02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
session all right no that's fine I
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
recognize I recognize representative tur
 
02:46:37.990 --> 02:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'd like to
 
02:46:41.070 --> 02:46:41.080 align:start position:0%

03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%

03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:30.510 --> 03:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
live and I'm going to call the Judiciary
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
Committee to and I am going to open the
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 254 FN and I'm
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
going to recognize Representative Bob
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
Lynn to introduce the
 
03:36:42.750 --> 03:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair and members of
 
03:36:45.150 --> 03:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
the committee U my name is uh Bob Lyn
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
I'm representative excuse me from Windam
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm here uh as a prime sponsor of
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:36:58.189 --> 03:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
254 um this is a bill um that has been
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
has been named as the end of life
 
03:37:03.030 --> 03:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom Act and I think that that is an
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate name because what it really
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
is about is giving people at the end of
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
their life the freedom to end their life
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
in a dignified way rather than endure
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
continually suffering this is a bill
 
03:37:20.429 --> 03:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
that was this is basically the same bill
 
03:37:23.710 --> 03:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
as was introduced last year um and pass
 
03:37:27.070 --> 03:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
the house on a bipartisan basis I say
 
03:37:30.429 --> 03:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I I always believe in in
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
just laying my cards on the table last
 
03:37:36.389 --> 03:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
year it passed on the bipartisan basis
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
candidly it had although it had
 
03:37:41.189 --> 03:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
significant support on my side of the
 
03:37:44.070 --> 03:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
aisle it had less support on my side of
 
03:37:45.790 --> 03:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
the aisle than it did on the other side
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
of the aisle and there was some
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
significant opposition on the other side
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the aisle also so it's fair to say
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
that this is a the bill passed on a
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan basis and was also opposed on
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan basis I hope that this
 
03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee and eventually the H the Full
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
House will once again pass this bill
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
because I believe it is the right thing
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
to do it provides for as I said before
 
03:38:15.870 --> 03:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom that's to me what this bill is
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
is really all about it says that if you
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
are a person that is within 6 months of
 
03:38:24.070 --> 03:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
dying and represent I thank
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative Perez for just pointing
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
out to
 
03:38:30.429 --> 03:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
me you should not just as a to clarify a
 
03:38:33.670 --> 03:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
PO point the bill says that you are as
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions you either within
 
03:38:37.469 --> 03:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
six you have been diagnosed to be within
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
six months of death or in medically
 
03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
six months of death or in medically
certified

03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
certified
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
hospice medically certified hospice does
 
03:38:47.590 --> 03:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
do mean you're within 6 months of death
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
you may be in hospice for longer than
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
that that is not medically certified but
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
medically certified hospices within six
 
03:38:59.830 --> 03:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
months of death this bill has a great
 
03:39:03.550 --> 03:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
many protective features it requires
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
that two doctors independently certify
 
03:39:08.910 --> 03:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
that you meet all
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
of for lack of a better term the the the
 
03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
requirements that we might all think of
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
you would have to you would have to meet
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
that you are competent to make a
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
decision that you really are uh you know
 
03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
within 6 months of death that you're
 
03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
competent to make a decision that you
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
understand that you don't have to make
 
03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
this decision that it's completely up to
 
03:39:35.550 --> 03:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
you um that you are that you are um you
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
have the mental capacity to make the
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
decision and if there's any question
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
about things like mental capacity
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's a a provision in the bill that
 
03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
that allows um for a referral to a
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
mental health professional who will
 
03:39:52.189 --> 03:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
again review the matter and make sure
 
03:39:55.950 --> 03:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
that um that in fact you meet all the
 
03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:57.630 align:start position:0%
that um that in fact you meet all the
requirements

03:39:57.630 --> 03:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:40:00.510 --> 03:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
so I think if you look through the bill
 
03:40:05.110 --> 03:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
you will see that it has a tremendous
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
number of appropriate protections to
 
03:40:11.389 --> 03:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that people are not are not taken
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of um and it's it
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it really does make
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
um a lot of sense if you believe as I do
 
03:40:25.630 --> 03:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
in Freedom and that people should not be
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh at the you know in the very last days
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
of their life that they should not have
 
03:40:33.630 --> 03:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
to endure un uh unnecessary suffering as
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
I mentioned La you know last I pulled
 
03:40:37.710 --> 03:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
out my speech on the house floor last
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
year when I said I'm 74 years old well
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
now I'm 75 years
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
old fortunately I'm INR relatively good
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
health but you know I know that I'm I'm
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the Autumn of my life uh that I hope
 
03:40:54.670 --> 03:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know I hope I have many years to go
 
03:40:58.750 --> 03:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
but uh at 75 uh I'm certainly not a
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
spring chicken and I guess what I would
 
03:41:03.870 --> 03:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
want to say is I believe that if the
 
03:41:06.670 --> 03:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
time comes that I am within six months
 
03:41:09.269 --> 03:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
of death and I'm suffering that I ought
 
03:41:11.429 --> 03:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
to have the I ought to have the
 
03:41:14.590 --> 03:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to end my life with dignity
 
03:41:16.510 --> 03:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
and you know as I think about it just as
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
I stand here now I don't know if I would
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
ever actually do it you know I I love
 
03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
life I love my life I love my family my
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
wife and my children and you know my
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
family I love I love frankly being in
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature and the thought that I
 
03:41:36.269 --> 03:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
would actually do that um it would have
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
to take an awful lot for me to do that
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that if when the if the End
 
03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
come is coming and I'm in you know
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
really in great pain or distress that I
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
ought to have that op that option to
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
make that choice and I think all of you
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
in this room and in our state ought to
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
have that option also and I know that
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
there are people who have really you
 
03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
know strong religious views to the
 
03:42:07.910 --> 03:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
contrary and I respect your
 
03:42:11.309 --> 03:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
views I guess what I would say to that
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
to those of you who do have those views
 
03:42:15.910 --> 03:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
is I don't want to interfere with your
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
religious views those are your views and
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine with me but I hope
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
that you would do me the the you know
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
reciprocal respect of saying that that
 
03:42:28.830 --> 03:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
if I don't share those views that I
 
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
ought to have the right to make that
 
03:42:31.560 --> 03:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
ought to have the right to make that
decision

03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:42:36.349 --> 03:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I want to
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
emphasize as I I think we've heard to at
 
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
Great length during the last during last
 
03:42:46.349 --> 03:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
year's hearing the evidence the the
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
surveys have shown that a majority of
 
03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents I believe it's
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
over 70% including a majority of
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
Republicans believe that that that uh in
 
03:43:01.590 --> 03:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
this principle of allowing people to to
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh to have the option of Medical Aid and
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
dying when they're at the end um
 
03:43:08.550 --> 03:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
interestingly you know I still quite
 
03:43:09.950 --> 03:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't quite understand this the survey
 
03:43:12.510 --> 03:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
apparently asked gun owners and they and
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
the the majority felt that uh that that
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill was appropriate now why
 
03:43:18.990 --> 03:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
they asked gun owners to be honest with
 
03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
you I'm not quite sure why they did that
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
what exactly it's got to do with with
 
03:43:25.149 --> 03:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
this issue but they did and I'm one of
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
the gun owners I was shooting last
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
night in nashille at a uh where I always
 
03:43:35.110 --> 03:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
shoot on Tuesday nights um so I'm a I'm
 
03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
one of those gun owners and I guess I
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know I guess I speak for the
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
majority of gun owners according to this
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
survey um I want to just and I don't
 
03:43:46.990 --> 03:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
want to go on for forever I want to
 
03:43:48.950 --> 03:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
emphasize sort of two points that I
 
03:43:52.950 --> 03:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
think are important to consider one is
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's this argument that is made that
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
well this will be subject to abuse that
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know people and it probably would
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
generally be older people uh people that
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know people obviously elderly people
 
03:44:09.309 --> 03:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
are the ones most likely to be affected
 
03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
by this that they will be abused and
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
that relatives or the Health Care system
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
will you know will will sort of try to
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
coers them into doing this and look can
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
I say that will never happen no of
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
course I can't say that that will never
 
03:44:29.349 --> 03:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
happen but you know we have very strong
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
procedures in this bill including
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties um uh Etc to prevent
 
03:44:39.630 --> 03:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
that from happening and I I guess what I
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
would say is you know there in the in
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
the whole area of estate and Trust law
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
um there's this same kind of issue you
 
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
know that somehow you know a potential
 
03:44:54.070 --> 03:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiary or an heir will coer
 
03:44:58.110 --> 03:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
somebody to uh uh leave the leave the
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
estate to them or whatever the case law
 
03:45:03.389 --> 03:45:03.399 align:start position:0%
if the casebooks are full of cases about
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing happening but we
 
03:45:09.389 --> 03:45:09.399 align:start position:0%
don't say that you know we're not we're
 
03:45:11.189 --> 03:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
going to sort of do away with the Trust
 
03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
In the state law because sometimes there
 
03:45:17.070 --> 03:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
are abuses I think we say that mostly um
 
03:45:19.389 --> 03:45:19.399 align:start position:0%
the law works pretty well and that when
 
03:45:21.910 --> 03:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
there are abuses there are remedies in
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
the law to take care of those abuses and
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the same that is true
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
here the the broader the other issue
 
03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
that is often raised in opposition to
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is really and I and I hope you'll
 
03:45:40.750 --> 03:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
as you listen the members of the
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
committee as you listen to the testimony
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
on this you will ask yourself are people
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
objecting to the terms of this bill or
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
they are they expressing concern about
 
03:45:53.910 --> 03:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
something that might happen not under
 
03:45:56.429 --> 03:45:56.439 align:start position:0%
this bill but something in the future
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
that um you know that that the law will
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
be it will be amended and change to make
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
it broader than it is right now well
 
03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and members of
 
03:46:11.309 --> 03:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
the leg understand that that's in your
 
03:46:14.149 --> 03:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
hands that I don't think that you need
 
03:46:17.070 --> 03:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
to be afraid afraid of yourselves afraid
 
03:46:20.429 --> 03:46:20.439 align:start position:0%
that you might you know be persuaded to
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
to go too far I'm not afraid of that
 
03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
that you will go too far and I'm
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not you know sure that I'm not
 
03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
going to go too far I guess the analogy
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
that I would draw in this whole area is
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
this you know if you give people the
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
right to freedom of speech some people
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
will yell fire in a crowded
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
theater if you give people the right to
 
03:46:49.950 --> 03:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
have to to have firearms in in defense
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
of themselves and others some people
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
will use the firearm to hurt somebody
 
03:46:58.590 --> 03:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
unlawfully if you give people the right
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
to privacy in their own homes under the
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment privacy in their own
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
own homes some people will use the
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
privacy of their homes to store drugs or
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
or other elements of of
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
crime but we don't say that because
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
those possible things could happen that
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're when we should do away with the
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
First Amendment or do away with the
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment or do away with the
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment and that's the
 
03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
situation here it seems I I submit to
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
you we in the legislature draw lines
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we do every day and we can
 
03:47:40.510 --> 03:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
draw the lines here properly and I
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
submit to you respectfully that that's
 
03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
what this bill does so for those reasons
 
03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
I hope that this committee will support
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm happy to answer any
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions of
 
03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:53.469 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions of
this

03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
03:47:58.030 --> 03:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
question I do um have a lot of questions
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
about this bill it is the same bill that
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
was put in last year exactly the same
 
03:48:09.269 --> 03:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill except for two changes in names and
 
03:48:12.510 --> 03:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
adding hospice to it and I have some of
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
the same concerns that I had last year
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
so under qualified by specialty or
 
03:48:21.070 --> 03:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
experience does that there is nothing in
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
this bill that says the person who has
 
03:48:26.189 --> 03:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
been treating me through my terminal
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
illness is involved at all is and what
 
03:48:32.830 --> 03:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
concerns me and you say qualified by
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
specialty does that mean that one of the
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
people certifying
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
my my availability to take my life if I
 
03:48:43.229 --> 03:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
have cancer it has to be an
 
03:48:46.670 --> 03:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
oncologist or if I'm in renal kidney
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
failure and I'm dying from that does
 
03:48:51.389 --> 03:48:51.399 align:start position:0%
that mean one of the people that has
 
03:48:56.149 --> 03:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
to certify my ability for this be a uh
 
03:49:00.510 --> 03:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
um a neurologist or if I have ALS does
 
03:49:03.510 --> 03:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
that mean that a neurologist has to be
 
03:49:05.550 --> 03:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says that
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
so basically it's my understanding and
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I could go
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
to my primary care physician who has
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
sent me to a neurologist or a
 
03:49:20.349 --> 03:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
neurologist or an oncologist or some
 
03:49:23.830 --> 03:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
other uh somebody else's family practice
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
and that person could certify me because
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that says the
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who has been treating me has to
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
be involved but in order to be in
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
hospice your treating doctor has to be
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
involved can you answer that so I I I
 
03:49:42.189 --> 03:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
think the answer to your question is
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
that you're you are right in this sense
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require that it be your sort
 
03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
of longtime treating physician and I
 
03:49:56.349 --> 03:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
think the what what it does require is
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
that both of the people who make the
 
03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that you are that that you
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
meet all the criteria including the
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
being within six months of death have to
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
be qualified to do that they and so and
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the the answer to
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
your question is
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
I I think that it's entirely appropriate
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
the way it is worded because I I think
 
03:50:21.790 --> 03:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do not want to
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
have happen is if my treating physician
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
that I've treated for a long time if if
 
03:50:32.710 --> 03:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
that person you know doesn't believe in
 
03:50:36.429 --> 03:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
the in in Medical Aid in dying and
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
therefore wouldn't be willing to certify
 
03:50:40.389 --> 03:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
because they they don't believe in it
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
and by the way there is a provision here
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
that says you you know gives people the
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
right to have have that doctors the
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
right to have make that decision but it
 
03:50:49.870 --> 03:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
but it also says and I think
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately if if my treating
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
physician has to happens to be one of
 
03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
those doctors who doesn't believe in
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying that shouldn't
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
mean that I'm that you know that's that
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
binds me I should be able to go to
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
another physician who might be a new
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
physician for me but does believe in
 
03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
that and as long as they're able to say
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
yes I've examined Lynn and he is within
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
6 months of dying he does know what he's
 
03:51:18.990 --> 03:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
doing and he believe you know and and he
 
03:51:20.590 --> 03:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
wants this to be done and the other
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
conditions are met he should be able to
 
03:51:24.149 --> 03:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
do this so I think the answer to your
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
question is yes but there's a good
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
reason for not requiring that follow
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
up follow
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
up the other term in here I won't go on
 
03:51:40.349 --> 03:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
with a 50 times but other term in here
 
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
is you use Healthcare entity um I did
 
03:51:46.110 --> 03:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
look up as I did last year and a weight
 
03:51:48.510 --> 03:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
loss clinic and a medical spa are both
 
03:51:51.309 --> 03:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
considered Health Care entities I'm
 
03:51:52.830 --> 03:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't hear the first part of
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
what a weight loss clinic right run by a
 
03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
physician yeah and a medical spa run by
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
a physician are both
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
considered Health Care entities the term
 
03:52:09.510 --> 03:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
that you use here is there anything
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
stopping a weight loss clinic to have a
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
sidebar of of
 
03:52:19.710 --> 03:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
issuing medical right and dying there's
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
no provision for that I think I think
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
the law I think the bill says that they
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
have to be qualified by by experience
 
03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
and uh and qualific qualifications to
 
03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
make the diagnosis now if there is a uh
 
03:52:38.670 --> 03:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
a weight loss clinic the doctors of whom
 
03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know can can make that diagnosis and
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
can go before the medical board and just
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
ify that they're in qualified to make
 
03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
that diagnosis I suppose they could do
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
that I you know if I were running a
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
weight loss clinic and I had never um uh
 
03:52:55.950 --> 03:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
been diagnosing somebody as to whether
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're within six months of death I
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
think I'd be um I'd be a little bit
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
worried about what the medical board
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
might say about my deciding that you
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
criteria follow up thank you any other
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker representative
 
03:53:15.399 --> 03:53:17.269 align:start position:0%
questions for the speaker representative
P

03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
P
 
03:53:19.950 --> 03:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
pel thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn for taking my
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
question I had this exact same um
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
question last year on the bill so on
 
03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
page nine line eight um Roman numeral to
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
If you're looking at it when a death has
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
occurred in accordance with this chapter
 
03:53:37.469 --> 03:53:37.479 align:start position:0%
the Death Shall be attributed to the
 
03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
underlying terminal disease now say for
 
03:53:44.590 --> 03:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
example I have a heart condition and
 
03:53:46.469 --> 03:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
driving my car at 100 miles an hour and
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
I crash it into a tree and I die what
 
03:53:51.630 --> 03:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
would the cause of death be if you had a
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
heart condition and you and you drove
 
03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
into a tree and and you and you died I
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
mean I I think it would probably it
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
would probably be that an accident but
 
03:54:04.990 --> 03:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
contributed to by by um by the heart
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
condition I mean I I you know to be
 
03:54:09.070 --> 03:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
honest with you and how a doctor would
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
would diagnose that circumstance I don't
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
know I would assume they'd have to make
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
reference to both conditions
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
followup so he somebody has okay let's
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
make it let's as phrase that differently
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
um somebody's being treated for cancer
 
03:54:36.030 --> 03:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
right and they in a car accident and
 
03:54:38.149 --> 03:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
they die right what's the underlying
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
what is
 
03:54:42.149 --> 03:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
the what is the ca I asked the first
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
question incorrectly what is the cause
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
of death in that situation so again I
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
think if if if I was diagnosed with
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
cancer tomorrow and the doctor told me I
 
03:54:57.309 --> 03:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
have you know six months or a year to
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
live and I was in a car accident
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow afternoon I assume the cause of
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
death would be the car accident but if I
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with cancer three years
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
ago and I was getting you know and the
 
03:55:11.030 --> 03:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
doctor said you've got a couple of days
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
to live and I was in a car accident and
 
03:55:15.790 --> 03:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
there was some SU suggestion that the
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
cancer had caused me to lose my ability
 
03:55:21.389 --> 03:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
to drive the car I would think that a
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
doctor and they assuming they could
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
determine that that they would say that
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
both of those things contributed to the
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
death so that I mean that's I guess that
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
would be my answer to that question
 
03:55:32.319 --> 03:55:33.870 align:start position:0%
would be my answer to that question
thank

03:55:33.870 --> 03:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
you there any other
 
03:55:39.070 --> 03:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'm gonna we have a lot of
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
people to get through if you have
 
03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
comments to make or you want to um
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to give you one
 
03:55:47.550 --> 03:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity just but ask a question
 
03:55:49.790 --> 03:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
please thank you thanks for taking my
 
03:55:52.269 --> 03:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
question do you have any concern where
 
03:55:54.670 --> 03:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
there is no residency requirement on
 
03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
this that we won't have people I'm going
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
to backtrack when I was a teenager
 
03:56:03.309 --> 03:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
abortions were not legal anywhere in the
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
United States I had wealthy friends
 
03:56:07.149 --> 03:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
whose parents took them to
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
England uh for
 
03:56:12.149 --> 03:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
abortions I'm telling you no residence
 
03:56:14.349 --> 03:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
requirement do you have any concern
 
03:56:17.830 --> 03:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
about people coming here over the Border
 
03:56:21.990 --> 03:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
like people here now are going to um
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont for this for this I I you know I
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
don't I I mean I guess the you know if
 
03:56:31.710 --> 03:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
the the argument apparently is New
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will become what the the death
 
03:56:37.309 --> 03:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
State people you know I I guess I I
 
03:56:40.269 --> 03:56:40.279 align:start position:0%
really want I haven't heard don't get me
 
03:56:43.030 --> 03:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
wrong speaking personally and from my
 
03:56:45.189 --> 03:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
philosop I have a a lot of problems with
 
03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
the way they do things in Vermont on a
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
lot of on a lot of issues but one of
 
03:56:52.750 --> 03:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
them is not this I have not heard people
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
say you know for and I guess Maine has
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
it too I haven't I haven't heard people
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
say oh you know don't go to Vermont or
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't go to Maine because that's a place
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
where you can go to end your life that
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
that um I you know I guess I would not
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
have I don't think that it would be
 
03:57:12.630 --> 03:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
detrimental to New Hampshire's
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
reputation in any way to say New
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of the states where you
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
can come to die with dignity I'll I'll
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll run the risk that of
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
Morton yes so I want to follow up with
 
03:57:30.990 --> 03:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question by the way
 
03:57:34.469 --> 03:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh with what um representative Pell was
 
03:57:37.750 --> 03:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
going with there uh if you follow that
 
03:57:41.229 --> 03:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
further down it talks about death
 
03:57:43.790 --> 03:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
following uh admin self-administering
 
03:57:46.110 --> 03:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
medic ations does not constitute grounds
 
03:57:47.469 --> 03:57:47.479 align:start position:0%
for postmortem
 
03:57:50.670 --> 03:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
inquiry um and going back to it's the
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
death is attributed to the underlying
 
03:57:54.670 --> 03:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
terminal disease this kind of reminds me
 
03:57:56.830 --> 03:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
of what happened a few years ago with
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
there was people dying in car accidents
 
03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
but their death was listed as covid
 
03:58:05.070 --> 03:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
death right they didn't die of Co they
 
03:58:07.710 --> 03:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
died of Smashing you a tree at 90 M hour
 
03:58:09.790 --> 03:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
it but it was listed a covid death or a
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
motorcycle accident right and based on
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
what you're saying here
 
03:58:18.030 --> 03:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
if it's listed under the underlying
 
03:58:20.469 --> 03:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a question here the
 
03:58:23.550 --> 03:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
the the question here is how would that
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
not skew statistics going forward as to
 
03:58:28.349 --> 03:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
how many people actually die of a
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
particular cause of death when they're
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
not actually dying from that cause
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
they're dying from assisted
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
suicide well I guess what I see I'm not
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I that I draw the I'm
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
not sure the analogy you drew is an
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
accurate analogy because if if it's
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
correct that you have that you within 6
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
months of
 
03:58:56.429 --> 03:58:56.439 align:start position:0%
death and and all of the other criterias
 
03:58:59.189 --> 03:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
are met I
 
03:59:00.990 --> 03:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
mean you
 
03:59:03.710 --> 03:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
are you're going to die within six
 
03:59:06.269 --> 03:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
months anyway and I guess I don't see
 
03:59:09.550 --> 03:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
what the um what I think what this is
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent is to have you know
 
03:59:17.309 --> 03:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
sort of the um
 
03:59:20.590 --> 03:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
the the the to the extent that there's a
 
03:59:23.309 --> 03:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
reputational issue of per the person
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
well the the person that the person
 
03:59:28.349 --> 03:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
committed suicide I mean I guess that
 
03:59:31.149 --> 03:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
would be what the what the um what the
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
issue would be but why I mean isn't the
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
person going to die anyway and and not
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know someday but very soon so so is
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
a followup no hold
 
03:59:44.189 --> 03:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
on do I do you want to follow up because
 
03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
it has be a question here not a comment
 
03:59:47.910 --> 03:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
you have an actual question no a
 
03:59:50.189 --> 03:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
followup but is it a question or just a
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
comment well I I guess it' be a question
 
03:59:54.429 --> 03:59:54.439 align:start position:0%
to what he just said so I'm going to
 
03:59:55.710 --> 03:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
allow but make it quick because we have
 
03:59:57.030 --> 03:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
to we have a lot of people that want to
 
04:00:00.590 --> 04:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
speak so so as a followup um my aunt uh
 
04:00:02.950 --> 04:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
was in the hospice she was told she had
 
04:00:05.229 --> 04:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
a few months left to die she had bone
 
04:00:08.030 --> 04:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
cancer and lived for 2 years so who
 
04:00:09.910 --> 04:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
decides that somebody only has 6 months
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
to die and how how do we make sure that
 
04:00:16.429 --> 04:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
that determination is is solid I guess
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
what I would say is we have two doctors
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
that are charged with making that
 
04:00:24.990 --> 04:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
decision and again you know if your
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
question is could the doctors be wrong
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
could there could two doctors say the
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
person's going to die in six months and
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's not actually true sure I think you
 
04:00:36.030 --> 04:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
know am I saying that that could there
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
could never be um you know there could
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
never be a two mistaken diagnosis I'm
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
not saying that but it seems to me that
 
04:00:47.790 --> 04:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
the the chances of that are relatively
 
04:00:49.630 --> 04:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
slim and I would also think I have to
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
add I would also think that if you're
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
one of the people that you know they
 
04:00:55.590 --> 04:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
said you have six months to live and you
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
know you're you're you're getting close
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
to the six to the six months and you're
 
04:01:01.309 --> 04:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
you know you're not feeling great but
 
04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
you don't feel like you know I'm taking
 
04:01:06.149 --> 04:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
my last breath tomorrow I would suspect
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
you're probably not going to use the
 
04:01:10.030 --> 04:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
medication I C I certainly
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.469 --> 04:01:19.479 align:start position:0%
um thank you this is um oh for this is a
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
question for the for the sponsor um some
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
of these issues um Fallin the purview of
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
the uh vital I guess the Department of
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
Vital Records which is part of the
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and I don't
 
04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
see anybody from there in the medical
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
inspector's office but uh did you did
 
04:01:37.870 --> 04:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
you I did you consult with these while
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
drafting the bill which I may not be
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
surprised if you didn't but um so you
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
any see input what like uh the experts
 
04:01:48.229 --> 04:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
on this particular part of the larger
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
issue uh think about
 
04:01:53.149 --> 04:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
this the answer to your question is I
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
did not do that consultation I suspect
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
that there will be people here that will
 
04:02:00.389 --> 04:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
testify after me that can answer that
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
question more you know with more
 
04:02:04.630 --> 04:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge than I than I can thank you
 
04:02:06.590 --> 04:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions seeing
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
none thank you thank
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
you we have a lot of cards to get
 
04:02:13.110 --> 04:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
through here so unfortunately other than
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor I'm going to have to
 
04:02:16.349 --> 04:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
limmit your testimony to 3 minutes and
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be a strict 3
 
04:02:21.389 --> 04:02:21.399 align:start position:0%
minute uh limit um if you have questions
 
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
and it's an actual question not
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
commentary I will you can ask the
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions I'll I'll recognize you but we
 
04:02:30.189 --> 04:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to give our personal
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
opinions on this bill during executive
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
session so in the essence of time if you
 
04:02:37.030 --> 04:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
have a question by all means ask it but
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
limit it to a question and I'm probably
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.189 --> 04:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr chairman and uh I
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
will stay with my uh notes uh so I won't
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
go off task um the Medical Aid dying
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
bill is not about your personal
 
04:03:02.110 --> 04:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
philosophical political party or even
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
your religious doctor in a sect it's
 
04:03:08.070 --> 04:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
about Freedom of Choice unlike some
 
04:03:10.110 --> 04:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
folks position between pro-life and
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
pro-choice this is not a decision about
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
The Unborn this is a decision made by a
 
04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
adult who lives in New Hampshire at this
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
point or may be here as a resident and
 
04:03:21.790 --> 04:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
makes a choice of what they want to do
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
and how they want to pass this isn't a
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly decision or made on a whim
 
04:03:28.349 --> 04:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
as representative Lynn pointed out this
 
04:03:31.229 --> 04:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
is a very limited restrictive option of
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
a fully competent adult this is not nor
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
can it be a a decision of someone who is
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
deficient and mental capacity let me
 
04:03:42.750 --> 04:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
provide a quick point of context when I
 
04:03:44.950 --> 04:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
was in high school my mother had a
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
stroke as a very vibrant and young nurse
 
04:03:50.149 --> 04:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
they said she would not live
 
04:03:54.269 --> 04:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
long it was then in 1978 13 years later
 
04:03:56.429 --> 04:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
that she passed would she have been a
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
candidate for this absolutely not my
 
04:04:01.630 --> 04:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law a widow Social Security
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
social school secretary an activist in
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
the community and a heavy smoker began
 
04:04:09.790 --> 04:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
her decline respiratory failure was in
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the hospital by her 70s by 72 she was in
 
04:04:15.229 --> 04:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
the hospital so much they never let her
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
out she was on IVs respirators full
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
force feeding Force to feeding etc etc
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
etc and time I won't go any further
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
would she been a candidate for this
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
probably not because she couldn't meet
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
the restrictions of this bill because
 
04:04:30.429 --> 04:04:30.439 align:start position:0%
she could not do it herself she could
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
not make that
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
decision finally the reason for my
 
04:04:37.389 --> 04:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
passion for this bill my brother 64240

04:04:59.550 --> 04:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
and then he came back after the alanes
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%

to move to the adex so I can finish my
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%

hot began declin he had to use a
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
quadible bypass he went through all that
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
one to another he had the last possible
 
04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion in elad and he said to me
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
Steve you are my medical proxy and this
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
is what I want this is how I want to

pass but the elad for those you who are
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
lay reason L lay folks like myself
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
basically means there a battery charger
 
04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
and you're hot just keeps going you
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%

04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
the battery he's done so at the end he
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
had hide issues in aronx New York we
 
04:05:41.229 --> 04:05:41.239 align:start position:0%

the war we helped him through a year of

radiation and chemotherapy which did
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
little good the rabbit cancer

metastasizing into his bones late in the

summer of that year nothing worked just
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
doctors lamented because agent orange
 
04:09:00.189 --> 04:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
induced cancer unlike others was somehow
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
impervious to Conventional treatments
 
04:09:04.590 --> 04:09:04.600 align:start position:0%

his remaining strength and indomitable
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
Spirit caused him to fight his cancer
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
the only way he could making the
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
decision to take his own life before the
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
cancer did save his strength and family
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%

nothing compared to

it the symptoms of this illness were

morning wanting to Die the Suicidal
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%

assistant suicide had been legal when I
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
was in the depths of my

like the best option it would have been
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%

build doubles down on these ableist

suffering
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
more energy should be spent by the state
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
to support these courageous
 
04:18:21.790 --> 04:18:21.800 align:start position:0%

world where people with disabilities are
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
isolated and pushed to the outskirts of

society Health and Human Services and
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid are a huge part of our state's
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
budget it is my really not fear but
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
concern that this bill will be used to
 
04:18:39.990 --> 04:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
limit medical treatment and services to
 
04:18:43.630 --> 04:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
people like me respectfully the sponsors
 
04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
of this bill fail to recognize the
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent this bill sets for
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%

change the world of work by challenging

World Views and subconscious biases by

showing that all people can work life
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
does not end when you are diagnosed with
 
04:20:13.590 --> 04:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
a disability chronic disease or mental
 
04:20:17.990 --> 04:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
health illness in fact it truly begins
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
because you then learn just how valuable
 
04:20:23.950 --> 04:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
life is I do not have a disability but I
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
have struggled with depression anxiety
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
and suicidal ideation for 13
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
years there have been moments and there
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
still are moments where I feel that the
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
world would be better off without me I
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
think back to my junior year of college
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
when I was struggling so heavily with
 
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
suicidal thoughts that I called my mom
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
crying like a baby because I felt
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
completely hopeless to emphasize just
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
how much I was suffering I hardly ever
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
open up to my mom about these
 
04:21:00.269 --> 04:21:00.279 align:start position:0%
things I have wanted to take my life
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
many times but I fully believe that the
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
moment I did I would regret it if I had
 
04:21:09.229 --> 04:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
taken my life in that empty student
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
apartment I would have missed out on
 
04:21:14.109 --> 04:21:14.119 align:start position:0%
graduating college College meeting the
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
love of my life and learning how to use
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
coping skills to manage my anxiety and
 
04:21:22.710 --> 04:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
depression I would have missed out on
 
04:21:25.229 --> 04:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
meeting people who have completely
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
changed my life I believe that passing
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
this assisted suicide bill would be
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous not only for myself and those
 
04:21:35.670 --> 04:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
who struggle with mental health but for
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
the disability Community it would not
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
only put these groups in danger but
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
reinforce the idea that people with
 
04:21:46.590 --> 04:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities have no value and are
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
better off dead just because life is
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
hard does not mean it is not worth
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
living living with depression and
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
anxiety is hard but it does not mean
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
life is not worth living watching my two
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
older brothers battle with lose their
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
battle with duchan musu aistrop is hard
 
04:22:10.830 --> 04:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
but it does not mean that life is not
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
worth living disability has made my life
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
harder but it is the greatest gift that
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
I have been given in this life I
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly believe that passing this
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill would encourage people to view
 
04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
disability as a problem to erase instead
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
of recognizing the invaluable
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
perspectives and blessings that come
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
with it please vote no on HB 254 thank

misdiagnosed with treatment resistant

headline describing Canada's upcoming

mental illnesses such as bipolar
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
disorder at the time I wish that we had
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
that option in America that there was an
 
04:23:41.670 --> 04:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
easy way out to my suffering the mere
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this legislation existing
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
in other countries nearly led me to a
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
second attempt you may hear supporters
 
04:23:49.149 --> 04:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
of this bill assert that assisted
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
suicide is not actually suicide because
 
04:23:53.790 --> 04:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
those who utilize it do not wish to die
 
04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
and those who end their lives by Suicide
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
do wish to die and therefore puts no one
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
at risk I find this claim to be
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly false when I attempted
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
suicide I did not wish to die rather I
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
desperately wish to live I simply saw no
 
04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
alternative to the mental and physical
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
suffering I was experiencing HB 254
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
affirms this option it asserts that
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
intentionally and unnaturally ending
 
04:24:16.590 --> 04:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
one's life in the face of suffering is a
 
04:24:18.910 --> 04:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate decision it puts countless
 
04:24:20.590 --> 04:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire young people like myself
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
at risk by normalizing Suicide as an
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable solution to one's
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
burdens we strive to prent prevent
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
suicide and healthy individuals because
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
of the knowledge that their lives have
 
04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
inherent and immeasurable value it is
 
04:24:34.510 --> 04:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
not our place to remove that value
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
simply because a life however short is
 
04:24:37.710 --> 04:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
plagued by
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
illness due to my health conditions I no
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
longer remember what it is like to not
 
04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
live in pain yet that pain does not mean
 
04:24:46.109 --> 04:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
that my life or lives like it are any
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
less worth living when the proponents of
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
this bill state that it is not only
 
04:24:51.870 --> 04:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
permissible but dignified to take one's
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
life when confronting great illness it
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
undermines the efforts of all those like
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
myself who have fought so hard to live
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the face of grave and often silent
 
04:25:01.229 --> 04:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
suffering the majority of young people I
 
04:25:02.710 --> 04:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
know have struggled with suicidal
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
ideation some of my friends have lost
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
their lives in that struggle if
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
legislation like this existed in New
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire several years ago I might not
 
04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
be here today New Hampshire sure
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
Citizens need Suicide Prevention not
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
promotion we need to be told that
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
contrary to the message of this bill our
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
suffering does not define us our lives
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
however difficult however limited are
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
worth living and celebrating thank you
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony and I urge you
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
254 will you take a question sure
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um last year we
 
04:25:42.510 --> 04:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
heard many young people concerned that
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
the passing of this bill would justify
 
04:25:49.469 --> 04:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
young people who um are suffering from
 
04:25:52.030 --> 04:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
um severe depression and feel that that
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
is a terminal illness that this would
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
legitimize them take in your life do you
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
feel that that is a possibility I do
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely um given that I was in that
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
position myself and just knowing about
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
this legislation and similar legislation
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
expanded in other countries nearly led
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
me to attempt to end my life as time I
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe that that could be
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
the case thank
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
Allison good afternoon thank you for the
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify my name is Laura
 
04:26:28.510 --> 04:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
alasam and I'm from London Derry excuse
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
my reading I want to keep this short uh
 
04:26:32.950 --> 04:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I urge you to vote against
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
itl it does nothing to determine whether
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
an individual may take his or her own
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
life rather it attempts to exercise the
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
power of the state to legitimize The
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
Taking of Life thereby implicating all
 
04:26:48.990 --> 04:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
of society in the Judgment that some
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
lives are devoid of human dignity even
 
04:26:55.229 --> 04:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
worthless we do not need to walk down
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
this dark road to see where it leads we
 
04:27:00.030 --> 04:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
need only look to Canada where Medical
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
Aid in dying has metastasized at a rate
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
of 30% a year-over year for most years
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
since it was legalized in
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
2016 I'm providing testimony about the
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
latest official update which was
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
published in December of
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
2024 the Canadian experiment illustrates
 
04:27:21.309 --> 04:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
that death once state approved as a
 
04:27:24.750 --> 04:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
solution inevitably becomes a duty
 
04:27:26.910 --> 04:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
especially for the poor the mentally
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
challenged and the
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
lonely just one other note in Oregon
 
04:27:34.109 --> 04:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
where assisted suicide has been legal
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
for 27 years a recent NIH study shows
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
that pain and the fear of pain don't
 
04:27:43.070 --> 04:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
even make the top five reasons for
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
choosing assisted death I urge you
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
please for the good of everyone facing
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
natural death or God forbid
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
contemplating suicide to focus on
 
04:27:56.070 --> 04:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
paliative Care Mental Health Care
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
accompaniment and encouragement for
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
those in this predicament thank
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:16.950 --> 04:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
after that will be Rebecca Brown go
 
04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm sorry no that's okay I was
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
adjusting the mic because I'm short um
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me today thank you
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
to the committee my name is Paige bman I
 
04:28:33.189 --> 04:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro 3 and I represent
 
04:28:37.109 --> 04:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
NASA Ward 4 within Hillsboro 3 I am a
 
04:28:40.349 --> 04:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
registered nurse I specialize in mental
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
health as well as Health Equity I would
 
04:28:44.070 --> 04:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
like to put out there my specialty is
 
04:28:46.269 --> 04:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
Maternal Child Health but as a nurse I
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
do have the background I think in these
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
spaces that um I can provide some
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
important information um first of all I
 
04:28:56.670 --> 04:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
do believe this is a body autonomy bill
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe throughout medicine we
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
should be able to make decisions about
 
04:29:03.389 --> 04:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
our own bodies taking away that right in
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
any instance is taking away our rights
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
and runs against how we practice
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
medicine in every other instance I'd
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
also like to speak to the um to the idea
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
that this would legitimize or send a
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
message that suicide is okay I have been
 
04:29:24.910 --> 04:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
working like I said on decrease in
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
mental health and I work in the area of
 
04:29:30.109 --> 04:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention in some of the work
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
that I do this is actually a
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
misconception that we have long been
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
fighting and in fact in medical spaces
 
04:29:39.630 --> 04:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
we are taught when we are assessing for
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation meaning the thought
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
that somebody might want to commit
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
suicide that we should be very direct
 
04:29:48.269 --> 04:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
and that we should speak about it we
 
04:29:50.910 --> 04:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
know over and over that bringing up the
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
issue and talking about it yes people
 
04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
might think about it but it does not
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
increase the instances of actual suicide
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
it does not increase the risk that is a
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
misconception um in terms of Health
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
Equity I would like to say that I have
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
been working on uh building Health
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
Equity programs I'm very familiar with
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
groups who are um who who end up with
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
health discrepancies um and I am very
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that unfortunately I see
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
that everywhere in medicine there is not
 
04:30:29.189 --> 04:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
one area of medicine where people are
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
not affected in different ways because
 
04:30:35.309 --> 04:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
of their identity group my this is my
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
biggest um uh point of contention with
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is that we don't withhold
 
04:30:43.109 --> 04:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate care
 
04:30:45.149 --> 04:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't work for everyone
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
this is not the correct Avenue for that
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
we should be doing for instance we
 
04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
should do we should work on other ways
 
04:30:54.309 --> 04:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
to improve mental health and decrease
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
suicide we should work on Health Equity
 
04:31:00.429 --> 04:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
we should work on discrimination within
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
healthc care we don't take away specific
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
options from people that they have a
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
right to have just
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:18.030 --> 04:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
group finally I would like to say that
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
if I get to the end of my life if you do
 
04:31:22.030 --> 04:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
and you decide that that is your
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate and your preferred next
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
action you should have the right to do
 
04:31:31.309 --> 04:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
that that is your right to say I don't
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
want to live out my days on pain
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
medications I would like to die with
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
dignity and I would like to do that when
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
I choose to do that I have also heard
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
your time is up if you want to just
 
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
close it real I'll just close it up the
 
04:31:46.469 --> 04:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that people can
 
04:31:48.070 --> 04:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
still do that on their own from a
 
04:31:51.109 --> 04:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
clinical perspective that scares me uh
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
because any anybody has the right to
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
have the appropriate medication and have
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
that be controlled by a
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
provider thank you very much Rebecca
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
questions hi thanks for this opportunity
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
I'm Rebecca Brown from Sugar Hill and
 
04:32:15.149 --> 04:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
I'm the organizer of New Hampshire
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
Alliance for end of life
 
04:32:20.590 --> 04:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
options I'm doing this work because my
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
husband ended his life In fact when I
 
04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
was sitting in that seat over here in
 
04:32:25.239 --> 04:32:26.349 align:start position:0%
was sitting in that seat over here in
our

04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
legislature I'm here because I believe
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
that we can help prevent that kind of
 
04:32:35.349 --> 04:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
endof life experience for many people
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire he was a military
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
veteran a New Hampshire native and he
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
was a tough guy from the North country
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
and you know people like this they do
 
04:32:48.910 --> 04:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
not want to suffer as he was and they
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
say there's euphemisms maybe you've
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
heard them the 38 solution I'll just go
 
04:32:57.070 --> 04:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
Woodshed we're present we're not
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill as a suicide
 
04:33:04.150 --> 04:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
prevention bill but I'm sure you know as
 
04:33:05.830 --> 04:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
I know that there are plenty of people
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
for whom this option would help prevent
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
that kind of violent death and if we can
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
prevent the kind of anguish that my
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
family felt as a result of that that
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
success you're hearing stories and will
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
continue to hear from people who have
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
loved ones who want this for themselves
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
or for their patients because this is an
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
accepted part of compassionate end of
 
04:33:28.480 --> 04:33:30.990 align:start position:0%
accepted part of compassionate end of
life

04:33:30.990 --> 04:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.789 --> 04:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
care you know already from the testimony
 
04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
this is for people whose lives are
 
04:33:38.349 --> 04:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
imminent and you will hear a lot of
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
courage today because it's very
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to get up and talk about a
 
04:33:42.320 --> 04:33:44.551 align:start position:0%
difficult to get up and talk about a
difficult

04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
death we want to acknowledge that for
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
people living with disabilities there's
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
terrible inequities in our culture in
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
our health care System but defeating
 
04:33:58.709 --> 04:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
this bill will not help that what this
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill does is prevent more suffering from
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
people already suffering and facing a
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
difficult end of
 
04:34:07.629 --> 04:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
life in your folder you will find a
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
booklet called our stories that details
 
04:34:12.789 --> 04:34:12.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
who have wanted this option for
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
themselves for their patients some most
 
04:34:18.349 --> 04:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
of them are still with us some have
 
04:34:18.359 --> 04:34:19.750 align:start position:0%
of them are still with us some have
already

04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
died these are your
 
04:34:24.029 --> 04:34:24.039 align:start position:0%
constituents you'll also find fact
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
sheets on the process of Medical Aid and
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
dying what it is and is not there's a
 
04:34:31.390 --> 04:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed bioethical medical journal
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
just published on rates of suicide in
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
states that have Medical Aid and dying
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
that know that shows no impact up or
 
04:34:44.189 --> 04:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
down there's also a wonderful piece from
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
one of our leading mental health experts
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire on why this is not the
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
suicide and there is a memo from the UNH
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
polling Center about their techniques
 
04:34:59.230 --> 04:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
and why that poll is uh all the results
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
from it for you there also a summary of
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
that people come here and join our
 
04:35:07.949 --> 04:35:07.959 align:start position:0%
movement because usually they've
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
experienced trauma in a dying process
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
but they're here today because they have
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
hope and it's hope that you all of us
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
will be holding compassion in our hearts
 
04:35:23.949 --> 04:35:23.959 align:start position:0%
is your time if you want to give a one
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
sentence wrap up thank you compassion in
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
your heart and freedom in your minds and
 
04:35:33.029 --> 04:35:33.039 align:start position:0%
allow New Hampshire the same rights as
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
our neighbors in Vermont and
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
Maine Live Free Die Free thank you and
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
04:35:42.279 --> 04:35:43.349 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
representative

04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
question do you have um this type of
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
offering for Citizens has been around
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
since 19 what 1994 when Oregon put it up
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
yet there are only 10 states that have
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
been active enacted it and it has never
 
04:36:05.709 --> 04:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
been discussed at the federal level do
 
04:36:08.230 --> 04:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
you have any insight where you've done
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
all this in but why that hasn't happened
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
10 out of 50 and never at the federal
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
level thank you for the question
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative it's not been discussed
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
at the federal level because the Supreme
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
Court has declared that this is a the
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
right to die if you'll call it that is a
 
04:36:24.000 --> 04:36:25.590 align:start position:0%
right to die if you'll call it that is a
state-by-state

04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
state-by-state
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
issue the reason that 10 states 11
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
counting DC is that as we can all attest
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
to this is a difficult subject people
 
04:36:37.869 --> 04:36:37.879 align:start position:0%
would rather not talk about death at
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
all and this is putting a uh
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
it brings it right out of the closet
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
which we think is a good thing we think
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
it is far better and healthier for
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
people to have clear discussions with
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
their care team as you just heard with
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
their loved ones about this but it's
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
part of our culture to avoid it right
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
now two out of 10 people in the US do
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
have this law so it is a significant
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
number thank you any other
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:37:12.000 --> 04:37:14.750 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
Kathy

04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
Baker yes hello my name is Kathy Baker
 
04:37:20.830 --> 04:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking you all to oppose this
 
04:37:23.070 --> 04:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
law I have no doubt that the
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned that there are good
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
intentions that lie behind this wanting
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
to give people control um and the desire
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
to alleviate suffering however what is
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
intended for good in its implementation
 
04:37:40.869 --> 04:37:40.879 align:start position:0%
is actually evil um first of all suicide
 
04:37:43.590 --> 04:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
is not legal we are not stopping anyone
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
from committing suicide but this law
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
makes many individuals accessories to
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
Suicide all of the doctors all the
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals the
 
04:37:56.709 --> 04:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
pharmacists the witnesses who have to
 
04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
attest that this person who wants to
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
kill thems is indeed mentally competent
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
to do it the person who has to sit with
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
the person who kills themselves we are
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
creating accessories to the suicide and
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
all of the people in the Senate and the
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
house who vote for this legislation
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
become accessories to Suicide another
 
04:38:22.670 --> 04:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
really dangerous and terrible thing
 
04:38:25.551 --> 04:38:25.561 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that it medicalizes
 
04:38:28.750 --> 04:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
death it turns our institutions for
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
health and healing into an
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for death and it equates
 
04:38:36.310 --> 04:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
killing with care and I've heard
 
04:38:39.629 --> 04:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
multiple people today talk about
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide and assist assisting in
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
suicide as care that is not medical care
 
04:38:49.551 --> 04:38:49.561 align:start position:0%
that is not health or healing the
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
mentality of the discussion alone is
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
taking us down this path it also
 
04:38:58.269 --> 04:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
devalues the lives of those who have
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
illness and disability and as eth
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
ethicist lean Cass warned the right to
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
die invariably becomes a duty to die and
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
in Washington state according to the
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
physician responsible for ending their
 
04:39:15.629 --> 04:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
patients lives 10% of all assisted
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
suicides in 2022 were because patients
 
04:39:20.349 --> 04:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
were concerned with financial
 
04:39:23.150 --> 04:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
implications of treatment in Canada this
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
form of death is now the fifth leading
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
cause of death it was intended as a last
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
resort for rare cases after only seven
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
years of implementation this is being
 
04:39:35.949 --> 04:39:35.959 align:start position:0%
marketed to every patient as an option
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
for care and it's a lot cheaper than
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Care they've even studied that
 
04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
that in Canada how much money they save
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
as people are choosing assisted suicide
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
instead of care the safeguards in the
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill do not prevent it from being
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
marketed to the ill and marketed to the
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
disabled as an option for care um and
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is extremely upsetting um in order
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
to com accurately discuss and evaluate
 
04:40:08.310 --> 04:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
this we shouldn't use euphemisms either
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is assisted suicide the very
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
definition of suicide is somebody taking
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
their own life voluntarily assisted
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
meaning people are assisting with it
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
assisted sadly meaning that the medical
 
04:40:22.708 --> 04:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
industry I apologize that's your time if
 
04:40:25.628 --> 04:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
you want to one sentence wrap up I will
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
um the great state of New Hampshire
 
04:40:30.190 --> 04:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
should never be tainted by encouraging a
 
04:40:32.430 --> 04:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
culture of death and encode a
 
04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
dehumanization of our ill our elderly
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
and are most valuable in our laws you
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to be an accessory to this
 
04:40:44.270 --> 04:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
death vote against this Bill thank you
 
04:40:44.280 --> 04:41:00.590 align:start position:0%

York thank you uh Mr chair members of
 
04:41:06.030 --> 04:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Gary York I
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
live in hopkington and I'm a retired
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
physician with many years years of end

of life advocacy including all things
medical

04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
Freedom I'd like to ask all the members
 
04:41:27.628 --> 04:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
uh on the committee to
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
please weigh the relevance of any
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
testimony that you receive whether it be
 
04:41:39.310 --> 04:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
written or oral as it relates to the
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
specifics of the bill
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of people talk about
 
04:41:48.510 --> 04:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals and what if and this will
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
probably lead to this and that but in
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
fact as long as the end of life acts
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
have occurred throughout the country
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
there's been no evidence there's any
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
been any abuse of this act
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I'd ask you uh most
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
respectively to weigh the relevance uh
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
is this a real life experience a story
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
of something that happened to somebody
 
04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
or is this something that we worry about
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
that does not relate to the bill as it
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
is outlined specifically and with
 
04:42:25.200 --> 04:42:27.430 align:start position:0%
is outlined specifically and with
numerous

04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
safeguards now we all know about medical
 
04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
freedom and our motto
 
04:42:36.990 --> 04:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
is Live Free or Die in New
 
04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh of Interest here is that
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
some people may recognize this is a
 
04:42:45.390 --> 04:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
license plate for a trailer well New
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a trailer for our
 
04:42:49.750 --> 04:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring states Vermont and New
 
04:42:54.510 --> 04:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have enacted this act uh
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
2013 and 2019
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
respectively Vermont has probably about
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
a third of the population of
 
04:43:09.670 --> 04:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
Maine New Hampshire has a similar
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
population as New Hampshire 1.4
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
million 1.4 million
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
people uh considering the number of
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
people that would be eligible for this
 
04:43:24.270 --> 04:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh made
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
legislation we're talking about 20 or 30
 
04:43:30.030 --> 04:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
people who actually use this in the
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
state of Maine or in the future State of
 
04:43:33.240 --> 04:43:34.270 align:start position:0%
state of Maine or in the future State of
New

04:43:34.270 --> 04:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's a very small number
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
so the very core of this as been said
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
before this is an individual Freedom
 
04:43:47.230 --> 04:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's really freedom for all but we're
 
04:43:49.270 --> 04:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
talking about individuals here and we're
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
talking that everyone has a choice to
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
make this decision we have to
 
04:43:56.350 --> 04:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
voluntarily apply for
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
this cannot be under coercion this is
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
something we volunteer for no one's
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
coming after us to hurt us I apologize
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
Dr that short time one sentence wrap up
 
04:44:11.310 --> 04:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
okay well I'd like to borrow a phrase uh
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
that we've all heard before my body my
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
choice and we can apply it to this act
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we could say my body my choice my
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
time and again I would just ask that you
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
please weigh the relevance of the
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
testimony carefully as it applies to the
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
bill if you do not understand the bill
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
any aspects of the bill or have concerns
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%

responding to treatment and had a quick
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
physical decline that led her to her
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%

possible I knew my mom was dying I could
 
04:46:38.910 --> 04:46:38.920 align:start position:0%

04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
never in a million years did I think she
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
would do what she
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
did my mom and dad adopted me from China

members of the House Judiciary Committee

President of St Joseph Hospital in

Nashua I also for the first 25 years of
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
my career uh was a practicing pharmacist
 
04:50:35.948 --> 04:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
in New England but as a health care
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
provider I must Advocate against HB 25
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire end of life
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom Act due to the ethical medical
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
and societal implications of legalizing
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
medical Aid and dying the primary
 
04:50:55.548 --> 04:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility of healthc care providers
 
04:50:58.948 --> 04:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
is to preserve life not to facilitate
 
04:51:01.590 --> 04:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
its termination even in cases of
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
terminal illness the sanctity of life is
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
a fundamental principle in medical
 
04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
ethics and the shift towards allowing
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians to prescribe
 
04:51:16.990 --> 04:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
life-ending uh medications contradicts
 
04:51:20.390 --> 04:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
the hypocritic oath first determining
 
04:51:24.030 --> 04:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
prognosis is not always precise many
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
patients outlive their sixth month life
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
expectancy and by providing an option
 
04:51:30.520 --> 04:51:31.868 align:start position:0%
expectancy and by providing an option
for

04:51:31.868 --> 04:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
maid we risk denying them
 
04:51:39.150 --> 04:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
there there that they might otherwise
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
have had to experience life see
 
04:51:45.270 --> 04:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
treatment advancements or even Achieve
 
04:51:45.280 --> 04:51:46.948 align:start position:0%
treatment advancements or even Achieve
Personal

04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
Personal
 
04:51:49.708 --> 04:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
Milestones second there is the potential
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
for coercion in subtle pressure from
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
either family members or financial
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
concerns especially among vulnerable
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
patients despite legal standards the
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
psychological state of terminally ill
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
patients including depression or fear of
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
being a burden could influence their
 
04:52:15.390 --> 04:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
decision making third as a health care
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
provider we have alternative tools to
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
manage pain and suffering our
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
organization has had an established
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
paliative CARE program for over three
 
04:52:31.868 --> 04:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
decades serving many in NASA and Pila of
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
care and Hospice Services focused on
 
04:52:38.830 --> 04:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
improving quality life relieving pain
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
and providing holistic support support
 
04:52:43.230 --> 04:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
to patients in their families rather
 
04:52:46.350 --> 04:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
than hastening death we should focus on
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
enhancing these services to ensure that
 
04:52:52.270 --> 04:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
patients die with dignity free of pain
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
and distress encouraging Medical Aid in
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
dying could also undermine trust in the
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
patient provider relationship as
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
patients May fear that provider their
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
provider is too quick to offer death as
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
a solution instead of endorsing Medical
 
04:53:14.430 --> 04:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying we should prioritize
 
04:53:17.470 --> 04:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
compassionate patient centered care that
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
affirms life even in the final
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
stages thank you any question
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%

but if I try to stop you from doing it
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's a class B felony coercion can be
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly subtle and it can be from
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
even discussing the cost of treatments
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
to you know who is going to take care of
 
04:53:58.990 --> 04:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
me so I look at it as it can be
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly subtle and very elusive
 
04:54:03.948 --> 04:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
around and great absolutely thank you
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%

about Co um in your professional
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
experience would you say that there was
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
coercion during during that time period
 
04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
and is that something they could apply
 
04:54:28.510 --> 04:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
to this in the future that people could
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
be coerced in the same way they were
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
coerced to get the vaccine and things
 
04:54:33.120 --> 04:54:35.788 align:start position:0%
coerced to get the vaccine and things
like

that

04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%

04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
this state approved a Constitution which
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
still proudly proclaims the natural
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent right to the
 
04:55:44.110 --> 04:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
enjoying and defending of life that
 
04:55:47.390 --> 04:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
right I suggest is uncon unconditional
 
04:55:50.190 --> 04:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
and prohibits suicide which despite the
 
04:55:52.510 --> 04:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
fancy words is what you are considering
 
04:55:55.390 --> 04:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
today one of the greatest privileges of
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
a healthc care Chaplin is to stand with
 
04:56:01.548 --> 04:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
a dying person and to love and pray with
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
them as they seek to Die the way they
 
04:56:08.470 --> 04:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
lived in patient obedience to God's will
 
04:56:11.110 --> 04:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
willing to wait for him to take them
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
home on this side there are those
 
04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
praying with the dying person and
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
relieving their pain while on the other
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
side are all who love them in heaven and
 
04:56:23.350 --> 04:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
wait to welcome them home in God's good
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
time like Pope Francis I believe
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide is a defeat for
 
04:56:31.628 --> 04:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
everyone and I join with him and with
 
04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
the constitution of this great state in
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
urging you to defend life and not
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
participate in taking it through making
 
04:56:41.788 --> 04:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
suicide SU suicide the law of this great
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
land we all want to find ways to love
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
those who are in pain especially those
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
who have been such important parts of
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
our lives but the loving thing is not to
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
encourage someone to end their life but
 
04:56:58.750 --> 04:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
to embrace every moment encourage them
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
to find meaning and to love every moment
 
04:57:04.750 --> 04:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
with every fiber of their being for all
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
the time that they are
 
04:57:12.390 --> 04:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:14.670 --> 04:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
you Michael Flynn or is it Michelle
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
Flynn I'm sorry Michelle
 
04:57:17.280 --> 04:57:26.868 align:start position:0%
Flynn I'm sorry Michelle
Flynn

04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
yep hi there I'm Dr Michelle Flynn I'm a
 
04:57:33.030 --> 04:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
retired Internal Medicine physician and
 
04:57:35.230 --> 04:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'm here to oppose the
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
bill I just have to go back to basics
 
04:57:40.990 --> 04:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
first Do no harm I'm going to strongly
 
04:57:42.670 --> 04:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that doctors should not
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
participate in killing their patients
 
04:57:47.310 --> 04:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
just have to say that outright I think
 
04:57:48.910 --> 04:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
other people have spoken to the slippery
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
slope that we see happening up north in
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
Canada where we see this starting out
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
small and as somebody Apple said
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
metastasizing to now they're even
 
04:58:02.830 --> 04:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
looking at drug addicts as mental health
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
having them choose assisted suicide I
 
04:58:11.150 --> 04:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
feel that when we open the portal to to
 
04:58:14.350 --> 04:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
choosing death as a treatment people's
 
04:58:16.548 --> 04:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
lives become tied to the
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
economic situation of their illness and
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
not so much to the Compassionate Care
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
that they um need I understand that
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're all here on both sides of the
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
issue to be compassionate to our
 
04:58:32.548 --> 04:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
patients and we we really hate to see
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
them suffer I agree with that and I hear
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
some of the horrible stories and I my
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
heart bleeds to hear them but I feel
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
that just down to the basics a physician
 
04:58:46.548 --> 04:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
is there to Shepherd a person through
 
04:58:49.350 --> 04:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
their life even into the difficult times
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
and there's so much room for improvement
 
04:58:55.030 --> 04:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
with paliative care and hospice care we
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
have so few hospice houses that do so
 
04:59:01.150 --> 04:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
much good there are ways of asking a
 
04:59:02.350 --> 04:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
patient if they don't want to get
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
further treatment and get pain relief
 
04:59:06.670 --> 04:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of room for improvement
 
04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't involve killing the patient
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
out right one of the things in
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
researching this topic that really upset
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
me there's obviously two ways to do it
 
04:59:19.548 --> 04:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
you can do an IV
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
injection or you could do an oral
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
injection I mean oral um cocktail the IV
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
includes a paralytic and that is very
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
concerning to me because I think we all
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
want to see the peaceful death of our
 
04:59:35.868 --> 04:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
loved ones or patients and when you're
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
giving them a cocktail that includes a
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
paralytic they are unable able to move
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
when they did autopsies of people that
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
receive Lethal Injections their lungs
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
were filled with
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
fluid and you're paralyzing them and the
 
04:59:53.510 --> 04:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
deaths could take IV it could take up to
 
04:59:56.670 --> 04:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
10 minutes of a patient's lungs filling
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
with fluid but they're unable to move or
 
05:00:01.628 --> 05:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
show that they're in un any
 
05:00:04.750 --> 05:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
distress orally they're so snowed they
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
probably can't move either but that can
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
take hours and hours and some people
 
05:00:13.510 --> 05:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
need a second cocktail and you don't
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
really know you don't have a actual
 
05:00:17.030 --> 05:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge that that person isn't
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
suffering or feeling air hunger or
 
05:00:21.390 --> 05:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
feeling like they're drowning and I feel
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
like if there's any uncertainty about
 
05:00:25.590 --> 05:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
the actual comfort of that patient that
 
05:00:27.868 --> 05:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
patient could be suffering but because
 
05:00:30.750 --> 05:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
the exterior looks peaceful I apologize
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's your time if you could just wrap
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
up in One S thank you well I just want
 
05:00:35.788 --> 05:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
to know that I think we should accompany
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
people compassionately through natural
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
death and not put them to death thank
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
you any questions you have some
 
05:00:44.190 --> 05:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
questions excuse me we have a couple of
 
05:00:45.628 --> 05:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
questions if you don't mind sure
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative pel hi thank you for
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question as a physician I
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
assume you've had to diagnose um people
 
05:00:57.310 --> 05:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
with terminal illness from time to time
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
in your practice have you ever diagnosed
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
somebody with a terminal illness where
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
you were able
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
to um comfortably predict the moment
 
05:01:11.070 --> 05:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
that they would die or exactly how long
 
05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
they would have left to
 
05:01:15.548 --> 05:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
live I always got it
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
wrong I would say I think you have six
 
05:01:20.910 --> 05:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
months and people would have two years
 
05:01:23.510 --> 05:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
or vice versa I think it's really
 
05:01:25.470 --> 05:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
sketchy it's a very difficult thing to
 
05:01:28.548 --> 05:01:28.558 align:start position:0%
do but I'm not an oncologist and I I
 
05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
defer to people that have expertise in
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
other areas but I could not do that at
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
allk you representative perz thank you
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question since you
 
05:01:41.788 --> 05:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
brought up about the cocktail are you
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
aware that in Oregon that they are
 
05:01:46.190 --> 05:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
stating that there are distressing
 
05:01:48.310 --> 05:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
complications from ingesting these drugs
 
05:01:51.788 --> 05:01:51.798 align:start position:0%
and 14.8% of patients had difficulty
 
05:01:54.150 --> 05:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
swallowing or experienc regurgitation
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
seizures or even regain Consciousness if
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
I had more time I probably would have
 
05:02:01.708 --> 05:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
gotten into that but I'm very very
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerned that we just accept this to be
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
a peaceful death and I think in a lot of
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
cases it's not it is not thank you thank
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
05:02:21.310 --> 05:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
me I'm Dr Scott Dyer uh I'm trained in
 
05:02:31.628 --> 05:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
clinical ethics and currently teach
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
philosophical ethics with emphasis on
 
05:02:36.670 --> 05:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
medical ethics at Duane University uh I
 
05:02:38.590 --> 05:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
earned my doctorate by writing a 300
 
05:02:40.948 --> 05:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
page dissertation on legalizing medical
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
aided dying in the United States uh
 
05:02:44.670 --> 05:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore I grew up in New Hampshire
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
while going to Keem State College where
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
I got my undergrad degree in
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
communication and philosophy uh growing
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
up in New Hampshire there's one Mantra
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we all kind of agreed upon everyone
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
across the aisle Live Free or Die uh
 
05:02:57.310 --> 05:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
therefore one should be able to
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
self-determine how they live and
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
logically how they die especially if
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
facing a terminal
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
illness uh substantive due process as I
 
05:03:08.030 --> 05:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
assume the lawmakers in this room are
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
aware of uh protect prot US citizens
 
05:03:13.230 --> 05:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
from excessive government meddling this
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
applies to end of life Medical Care as
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
well the ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
in buvia V Superior Court in 1986 upheld
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
the patient's right to refuse medical
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
treatment uh which then granted Miss
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth buvia the right to remove a
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
feeding tube that was inserted and kept
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
in against her will essentially Force
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
feeding her the decision was in line
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
with several court cases of that era
 
05:03:37.868 --> 05:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
that allows patients to stop medical
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
treatment at any point
 
05:03:42.510 --> 05:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh today due to case law precedent and
 
05:03:44.350 --> 05:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
modern medical ethics a patient is
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
legally and morally able to stop medical
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
treatment at any point even if that
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
sensation results in their
 
05:03:53.310 --> 05:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
death so essentially removing a
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
ventilator feeding tube whatever it may
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
be is both legally and ethically
 
05:03:59.310 --> 05:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable in the clinical realm even if
 
05:04:01.708 --> 05:04:01.718 align:start position:0%
death will come from that uh the nth
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court of Appeals found that it
 
05:04:06.110 --> 05:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
was not just to deny adults with full
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
mental capacity the right to pursue
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
medically dying when the patient is
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
facing excessive pain and suffering
 
05:04:14.190 --> 05:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
while having a terminal illness the
 
05:04:15.788 --> 05:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
appell at court further stated that
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
those terminally ill patients have a
 
05:04:19.708 --> 05:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected Liberty to be
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
free from those undue government
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
intrusions which applies to choices of
 
05:04:26.150 --> 05:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
Medical Care the Oregon state law that
 
05:04:27.510 --> 05:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
some people have talked about up here it
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
was then replic was passed in 1994 put
 
05:04:32.270 --> 05:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
into place in 1997 uh and has been
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
replicated around the world in countries
 
05:04:36.510 --> 05:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
and states in the US due to its efficacy
 
05:04:38.868 --> 05:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
and its regulatory framework uh many of
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
these laws have been called death With
 
05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
Dignity laws because it allows people to
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
do just that die with dignity instead of
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
rising in pain for the last six months
 
05:04:48.190 --> 05:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
of their life uh many people will put
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
forth arguments against this bill one of
 
05:04:51.150 --> 05:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
those arguments says it's equivalent to
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
killing patients um legalization will
 
05:04:55.230 --> 05:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
lead to the slippery slope that people
 
05:04:57.070 --> 05:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
could die with however they want to in
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
the hospital and doctors can kill with
 
05:05:00.548 --> 05:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
impunity uh this is not the case in the
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
United States has taken a long time for
 
05:05:03.910 --> 05:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
us to get to this point where only a few
 
05:05:06.910 --> 05:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
States even allow it um also I think
 
05:05:09.628 --> 05:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
that if we maintain Physicians and
 
05:05:12.150 --> 05:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
Professional Medical ethicists uh to be
 
05:05:13.708 --> 05:05:13.718 align:start position:0%
passing these bills we can ensure the
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:19.548 --> 05:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
happen uh we allow our pets to be put to
 
05:05:20.910 --> 05:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
death when they're at end of life and
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
suffering why can't we do the same for
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
fellow humans Humanity uh further
 
05:05:27.070 --> 05:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
because of the strict regulations that
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
are in place i e the slippery slope will
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
never come to fruition opponents may say
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill will threaten vulnerable
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
populations uh however there have been
 
05:05:36.990 --> 05:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
several studies that show the vulnerable
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
populations actually are in favor of
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
these bills because it gives them
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
options uh they face discrimination if
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to end their lives
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
on their own terms due to their
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities when it comes down to it
 
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
patient autonomy must always that's your
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
time if you can do a one second wrap up
 
05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
sorry one yep um the multiple biomedical
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
ethics uh principles come into play here
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
specifically autonomy beneficence and
 
05:06:04.708 --> 05:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
non-maleficence autonomy is know
 
05:06:06.430 --> 05:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring patients are able to do what
 
05:06:08.350 --> 05:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
they see is right and fit in their
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
medical care benefic do what's best for
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
the patient non-maleficence avoid
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
harming the patient sometimes allowing a
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
patient to end their life is indeed
 
05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
doing what's best for them and avoiding
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
harm uh thank you I'll take any
 
05:06:22.708 --> 05:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
questions if anybody would like any
 
05:06:26.590 --> 05:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:37.230 --> 05:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%

fill out a pink card and you can turn it
 
05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
in down
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
here good afternoon my name is Katie
 
05:06:48.910 --> 05:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
Kelly and I'm a policy Council attorney
 
05:06:51.270 --> 05:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
with Americans United for life but my
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
background is in Prosecuting healthc
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
care fraud and the physical emotional
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
and financial abuse of vulnerable adults
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
with physical and mental
 
05:07:02.830 --> 05:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities today I urge your
 
05:07:05.310 --> 05:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill
 
05:07:08.270 --> 05:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
254 representative earlier you asked us
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
to consider and you asked the Comm
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
committee to consider specific terms of
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that we might oppose I ask
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
y'all to look to section 137
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
dm4 here a healthc care provider is only
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
required to refer a patient to a mental
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
health professional if the physician
 
05:07:30.310 --> 05:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
quote has doubts as to the mental
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
capacity of the
 
05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
patient but a physician does not even
 
05:07:38.190 --> 05:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
have to formally evaluate a patient
 
05:07:40.590 --> 05:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
requesting physician assisted suicide
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
for depression or any other mental
 
05:07:45.150 --> 05:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
health conditions that might impact
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
their decision-making
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
abilities in New Hampshire 25% of adults
 
05:07:54.070 --> 05:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
have reported a depression diagnosis at
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
some point in their lives this means
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
that at least one in four individuals
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
requesting Medical Aid and dying under
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
this bill may be suffering from
 
05:08:07.390 --> 05:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
depression and under this bill they will
 
05:08:11.310 --> 05:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
not be adequately screened by it
 
05:08:13.590 --> 05:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
studies in Primary Care settings suggest
 
05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
that only about 50% of depressed
 
05:08:18.270 --> 05:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
patients are recognized and that number
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.830 --> 05:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
patients the standard of care for
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
patients with end of life conditions
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
requesting to end their lives ultimately
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
requires that Physicians evaluate and
 
05:08:36.190 --> 05:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
treat patients for depression and
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation well under house bill
 
05:08:38.760 --> 05:08:40.030 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation well under house bill
254

05:08:40.030 --> 05:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
254
 
05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
that requirement is not
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
here in conclusion House Bill 254 will
 
05:08:48.070 --> 05:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
result in discrimination against
 
05:08:49.868 --> 05:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people suffering from
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
depression I respectfully ask you all to
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
review section 137 M4 review the doubts
 
05:08:59.110 --> 05:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
provision and consider that that is only
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
one of the many flaws in this bill my
 
05:09:04.230 --> 05:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony has also been
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
submitted online thank you for your
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
consideration today thank you um
 
05:09:10.548 --> 05:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative for
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
question is it reasonable to say that
 
05:09:17.910 --> 05:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
anyone who is in the last six months of
 
05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
their life who would request this would
 
05:09:23.708 --> 05:09:23.718 align:start position:0%
be somewhat depressed yes representative
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
studies actually show that poor mental
 
05:09:28.788 --> 05:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
health is comorbid with chronic
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
illnesses such as diabetes heart disease
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
and these are even com more common in
 
05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
elderly patients with hidden depression
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
and so you're absolutely correct
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions seeing none thank
 
05:09:43.548 --> 05:09:43.558 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:09:50.910 --> 05:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.470 --> 05:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
leak Megan Smith will be next if you
 
05:10:02.430 --> 05:10:02.440 align:start position:0%

05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
Rebecca leak and I live in Andover and I
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
am testifying in opposition to HB
 
05:10:22.110 --> 05:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
254 God gave us life creating Us in His
 
05:10:24.150 --> 05:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
image and so taking an innocent human
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
life is sacred so an innocent human life
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
is sacred from conception to Natural
 
05:10:30.548 --> 05:10:30.558 align:start position:0%
death thus murder The Taking of an
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
innocent human life is evil it is
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
immoral and wrong to assist individuals
 
05:10:37.948 --> 05:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
in taking their own life State sanction
 
05:10:39.948 --> 05:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
suicide in any form is is incredibly
 
05:10:42.230 --> 05:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
immoral and dangerous creating a culture
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
of death instead of a culture of life
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
this is is especially dangerous for
 
05:10:48.510 --> 05:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
young people who are turning to suicide
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
and shocking numbers a study conducted
 
05:10:53.190 --> 05:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
by the CDC found that in
 
05:10:57.070 --> 05:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
2021 10% of high schoolers actually
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide by permitting assisted
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
suicide in any form the government is
 
05:11:03.750 --> 05:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
conveying to young people that suicide
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
is an acceptable way of dealing with
 
05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
their pain or helplessness moreover once
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
we have started down this path to
 
05:11:13.070 --> 05:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
devaluing human life where will it end
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
while some have objected to the slippery
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
slope argument it is completely
 
05:11:18.830 --> 05:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable and even wise to consider
 
05:11:20.670 --> 05:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
what other states and countries have
 
05:11:22.310 --> 05:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
done with this issue for they are
 
05:11:25.270 --> 05:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
warnings about what might happen here in
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
Canada the medical assistance and Dy
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
program began in 2016 with very similar
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions to those in this bill only
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
5 years later those restrictions were
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
expanded to include incurable patients
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
and in 2024 before they were further
 
05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
expanded to include patients with mental
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
illness and drug addicts there have also
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
been document instances of misuse and
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
abuse of maid furthermore document
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
doctors are encouraged to bring up
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
medical assistance in dying before their
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
patients do for example a paralympian
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
veteran who requested a chairlift was
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
instead offered a medical assistance in
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
dying kit Canada is not alone similar
 
05:12:06.430 --> 05:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
atrocities are occurring in the
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
Netherlands where doctors are allowed to
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
S dat and euthanize Advanced dementia
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
patients who had previously indicated
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
their consent but later resisted the
 
05:12:17.548 --> 05:12:17.558 align:start position:0%
procedure within the United States
 
05:12:20.110 --> 05:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
itself in Oregon where assisted suicide
 
05:12:23.230 --> 05:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
is legal for terminally ill adults more
 
05:12:24.990 --> 05:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
than half of the assisted deaths in
 
05:12:27.590 --> 05:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
20121 were of individuals who said they
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
felt like a burden on loved
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
ones furthermore while this bill
 
05:12:33.788 --> 05:12:33.798 align:start position:0%
requires an individual to have a
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
prognosis of 6 months or less to live
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
such diagnoses are far from certain as
 
05:12:41.110 --> 05:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
some individuals have gone on to live
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
for over a decade after such a prognosis
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
therefore I strongly urge you to re
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
recommend HB 254 as inexpedient to
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for considering my
 
05:12:56.350 --> 05:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:03.390 --> 05:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
Smith good afternoon my name is Megan
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
Smith I live here in BO New Hampshire
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a master's prepared board certified
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
registered nurse having practice in the
 
05:13:10.830 --> 05:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for the last 20
 
05:13:12.788 --> 05:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
years I'm here today to share my
 
05:13:14.910 --> 05:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
personal and professional support for
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's end of life Freedom Act
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
20 years ago when I was 21 years old I
 
05:13:22.110 --> 05:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
lost the first man I ever loved he
 
05:13:24.030 --> 05:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
raised me from the time I was two and
 
05:13:26.270 --> 05:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
was hands down the best dad I could have
 
05:13:28.110 --> 05:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
ever had the privilege of having
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my time with him would be
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
dramatically cut short when in the
 
05:13:33.390 --> 05:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
winter of 2004 he was diagnosed with
 
05:13:36.110 --> 05:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
stage 4 lung cancer he fought for two
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
years participating in clinical trials
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
and receiving harsh rounds of
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy we knew these two years
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
were only prolonging the time we had
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
with him as his diagnosis was terminal
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
but at just 56 years old none of us were
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
ready to say goodbye despite all all of
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
us not being ready in October of 2006 he
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
was actively dying he was less than 90
 
05:13:58.390 --> 05:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
pounds at that time and was suffering
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
from intense pain due to the m
 
05:14:02.910 --> 05:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
metastasis of his cancer he wasn't
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
eating he wasn't drinking he was
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
frequently hallucinating from the
 
05:14:08.708 --> 05:14:08.718 align:start position:0%
medications we were giving to attempt to
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
control his pain because of his symptoms
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
the dramatic change in the way he looked
 
05:14:14.910 --> 05:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
and his General suffering he asked for
 
05:14:16.708 --> 05:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
no visitors in those final weeks and
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
days in his final three days he
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
developed painful pressure ulcers
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
because his skin was so Frable from his
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
malnutrition and his extremely low
 
05:14:27.150 --> 05:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
weight as nurses my mom and I knew what
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
had to be done we turned him every two
 
05:14:31.230 --> 05:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
hours day and night trying to offload
 
05:14:33.670 --> 05:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
his hips his heels and his tailbone but
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
despite our best efforts the pressure
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
ulcers prevailed and in the last 24
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
hours utilizing every medication we had
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
available to us through our hospice uh
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
benefit we couldn't give him his one
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
wish which was not to die from drowning
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
he suffocated to death and that is
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
something that my mom and I will never
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
forget if he was able to have access to
 
05:14:56.910 --> 05:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying we have no doubt
 
05:14:58.230 --> 05:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
he would have chosen to take control
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
over his dying process we would have had
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
an outdoor get together at our home with
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
all his friends in family and we would
 
05:15:06.110 --> 05:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
have celebrated his life we would have
 
05:15:08.030 --> 05:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
had a DJ playing music because he and my
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
mom were known for their block parties
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
he would have had one of his favorite
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
meals which was goulash with raisins
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
gross he would have had um after the
 
05:15:18.510 --> 05:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
celebration was done he would have
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
chosen to take his maid prescription and
 
05:15:22.190 --> 05:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
drift off into a peaceful sleep and
 
05:15:24.270 --> 05:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
eventually a peaceful death he would
 
05:15:25.708 --> 05:15:25.718 align:start position:0%
have been able to choose to end his life
 
05:15:27.548 --> 05:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
on his own terms before his pain and
 
05:15:30.670 --> 05:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
suffering became unbearable currently as
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
a a full-time registered nurse and
 
05:15:34.190 --> 05:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
actively working I'm also a full-time
 
05:15:36.270 --> 05:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
doctor of nursing practice student and

05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
researching maid I have looked through
 
05:15:42.190 --> 05:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
the evidence and here's what I find mate
 
05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
exists to address a deeply sensitive and
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
complex problem the suffering of
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
terminally ill patients in the final
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
stages of their
 
05:15:54.270 --> 05:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
life uh maid currently provides two five
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%

05:17:45.510 --> 05:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative L talked about
 
05:17:46.868 --> 05:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
trusted in state
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
law well yes trusted and state law
 
05:17:52.830 --> 05:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
applies after people
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
die but it protects their wishes not
 
05:17:56.000 --> 05:17:57.788 align:start position:0%
die but it protects their wishes not
their

05:17:57.788 --> 05:17:57.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
lives there is a protection at least
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
proposed within this bill that
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh coercing one to administer the drugs
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
after they've got the prescription would
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
be a class B felony but there'll be no
 
05:18:19.470 --> 05:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
investigation there are no
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and I don't I can't imagine
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
any way that could ever be enforced so I
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
find that to be along with the other
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
prescriptions in this bill like the
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
conditions and all of that which have
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
failed everywhere they've been willfully
 
05:18:34.830 --> 05:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
inadequate the mental health protection
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
is similar as you've heard a lot of
 
05:18:38.910 --> 05:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
people suffer from depression
 
05:18:41.150 --> 05:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
particularly near the end of their lives
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot more than one meeting
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
with a person
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not that person
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
actually has mental
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
illness my son has mental illness and
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
he's had a lot of meetings where they
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
told him he was
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
fine right my I find this bill to be
 
05:19:03.788 --> 05:19:03.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary my brother had pancreatic
 
05:19:06.750 --> 05:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
cancer for five years they weren't very
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
pleasant years
 
05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
he was in hospice care when he died at
 
05:19:13.628 --> 05:19:13.638 align:start position:0%
home it was it was fine it was
 
05:19:17.708 --> 05:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
beautiful right there's no we don't need
 
05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
to have this so people can buy
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
peacefully at home we
 
05:19:27.788 --> 05:19:27.798 align:start position:0%
have the protocols in
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
place there are no protocols really for
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide I was reading yesterday
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
about the pro the the drugs that are
 
05:19:41.430 --> 05:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
used and how there are no
 
05:19:44.590 --> 05:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
standards which is understandable
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
because many of the patients who would
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
be requesting and actually wanting to
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
take these drugs I'm sorry that's your
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
time if you have a one sense wrap up
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
I'll do one more thing studies showed
 
05:19:58.548 --> 05:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
that if we do this the suicide rate
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
outside of it would increase by
 
05:20:03.670 --> 05:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
6.3% which in New Hampshire amounts to
 
05:20:07.470 --> 05:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
eight more dead people from suicide each
 
05:20:09.830 --> 05:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
and every year it's a price we should
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely not pay I ask you urge you to
 
05:20:14.590 --> 05:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill are there any questions
 
05:20:19.948 --> 05:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
at all seeing none thank you thank you
 
05:20:19.958 --> 05:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
at all seeing none thank you thank you

05:20:51.310 --> 05:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:53.868 --> 05:20:53.878 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I am here today on behalf
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
of my husband to share the pain that
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
Jeff went through every day for the last
 
05:21:01.830 --> 05:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
eight years of his
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
life he had atypical Parkinson's disease
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
and passed away eight months ago on May
 
05:21:14.910 --> 05:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
23rd three days before his 71st birthday
 
05:21:17.230 --> 05:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
and our 34th
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
anniversary over the course of this
 
05:21:21.510 --> 05:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
disease he had lost his ability to move
 
05:21:25.110 --> 05:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
on his own to wash to use the bathroom
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
to walk to hike to ride his
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
bicycle to ski to teach
 
05:21:37.230 --> 05:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
skiing in short so many of the things
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
that made his life what it
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
was which gave him meaning gave him
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
Joy he was no longer living he was
 
05:21:53.948 --> 05:21:53.958 align:start position:0%
existing especially the last five years
 
05:21:57.510 --> 05:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
he was in emotional and physical
 
05:22:00.990 --> 05:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
pain constantly looking at the clock
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
waiting for the day to go by crying
 
05:22:04.958 --> 05:22:06.030 align:start position:0%
waiting for the day to go by crying
being

05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:22:08.750 --> 05:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
frustrated angry and feeling feeling
 
05:22:11.708 --> 05:22:11.718 align:start position:0%
helpless because he was not able to do
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
anything on his own he knew that this
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
disease would kill him having the option
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
to die on his own terms may have given
 
05:22:26.470 --> 05:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
him back some of the sense of control
 
05:22:27.990 --> 05:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
and peace of
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%

05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
die state which you've heard Also let's
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
make it so by allowing those who want to
 
05:23:09.868 --> 05:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
die to do so with dignity and give them
 
05:23:12.430 --> 05:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
the option if it is right for them to be
 
05:23:15.310 --> 05:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
at peace the pictures that are there
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
show his progression of his life and the
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
last two were two weeks before he died
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
and not quite the first two pages thank
 
05:23:28.990 --> 05:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
you I have a question you wouldn't mind
 
05:23:33.070 --> 05:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative you all set thank
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Melinda Sims I'm a
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
disabled veteran I got hurt serving our
 
05:24:01.868 --> 05:24:01.878 align:start position:0%
country and like many vets I had to
 
05:24:04.750 --> 05:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
rebuild my life from scratch today I'm
 
05:24:06.628 --> 05:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
fighting a different battle one that
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
threatens every disabled veteran in
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
person with disability in New Hampshire
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
let me be blunt hb24 is deadly they're
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
calling it medical assistance in dying
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
but that's just fancy words for giving
 
05:24:22.830 --> 05:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
up on people like me in Canada where
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
they passed this kind of law deaths
 
05:24:27.750 --> 05:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed in Canada medical assistance
 
05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
and dying programs have exploded from
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
1,8 deaths in 2016 to
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
13,241 deaths in 2022 a staggering 1200%
 
05:24:43.708 --> 05:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
increase in just 7 years think about it
 
05:24:45.788 --> 05:24:45.798 align:start position:0%
it's now their fifth leading cause of
 
05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
death here's what keeps me up at night
 
05:24:50.830 --> 05:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
they're actually counting the money they
 
05:24:54.030 --> 05:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
save when disabled people die 139
 
05:24:57.070 --> 05:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
million a year they're turning our lives
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
into budget cuts even worse they're now
 
05:25:03.190 --> 05:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
using 6% of organ donations from people
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
who choose to die they're literally
 
05:25:09.310 --> 05:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
turning our deaths into a business
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
this hits home in New Hampshire we've
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
got over 71,000 veterans and 163,000
 
05:25:19.110 --> 05:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
people living with disabilities half of
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
us are already struggling with poverty
 
05:25:24.670 --> 05:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
now imagine your doctor who's supposed
 
05:25:28.230 --> 05:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
to help you live see seeing you as a
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
cost cut that's not just wrong it's
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
terrifying you know what's really
 
05:25:38.430 --> 05:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
shocking 80% of doctors admit they
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
biased against people with disabilities
 
05:25:43.708 --> 05:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
they look at something someone like me
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
and think our lives aren't worth living
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here to tell you my life has
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
value every disabled Veteran's life has
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
value every disabled person has value
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
the same the same state that says it
 
05:26:03.310 --> 05:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
wants to prevent veteran suicide is now
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
considering a law that would push us
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
towards death we can't let our Society
 
05:26:11.548 --> 05:26:11.558 align:start position:0%
normalized suicide as a solution that's
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
not who we are as Americans we did when
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
did we become so cold that we started
 
05:26:21.230 --> 05:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
seeing death as a cost-saving measure
 
05:26:23.548 --> 05:26:23.558 align:start position:0%
our state should be focusing on helping
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
people with dignity not creating paths
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
to end their lives I'm not just asking
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this bill I'm asking you
 
05:26:36.030 --> 05:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
to stand with our veterans stand with
 
05:26:39.788 --> 05:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
disabled people and and a clear message
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
we don't put a price tag on human life
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
not here not ever our lives aren't
 
05:26:49.750 --> 05:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
budget items we're people and we deserve
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
more than this thank
 
05:26:57.190 --> 05:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate the Outburst but we I
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%

the Outburst

live in the Live Free or Die State and
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
currently must go to another state to
 
05:29:30.150 --> 05:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
assist our loved ones if they want the
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
option to end their suffering and loss
 
05:29:36.670 --> 05:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
of dignity why may I ask is this my
 
05:29:39.830 --> 05:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
husband bill was a very proud man and
 
05:29:43.150 --> 05:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
strong man who loved his State our state
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire after three and A2
 
05:29:48.910 --> 05:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
years of fighting cancer and was told he
 
05:29:51.270 --> 05:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
had less than six months to live he
 
05:29:54.230 --> 05:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to pass in his home state but had
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont he wanted to pass in peace and
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
not the horrific end of life that would
 
05:30:04.030 --> 05:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
have been his see like everyone else has
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
said here he had a bloodfed tumor and
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
would have died choking on his own
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
blood would you would that be the last
 
05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
thing that you would want to remember
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
about your loved ones
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
Journey or would you want to feel as
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
Bill's family and I did that he died in
 
05:30:27.390 --> 05:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
peace this bill has nothing to do with
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities suicide nor religion we
 
05:30:32.750 --> 05:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
have the freedom of religion in this
 
05:30:35.430 --> 05:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
country it is one of the principles we
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
are founded on that means that no one
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
especially public servants should impose
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
their religious beliefs on others this
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill allows people of every Faith or of
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
no faith at all to follow their own
 
05:30:54.230 --> 05:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
conscience values and
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
beliefs it respects each of us as
 
05:30:56.920 --> 05:30:58.548 align:start position:0%
beliefs it respects each of us as
dignified

05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
dignified
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
humans I am likely one of the few people
 
05:31:04.510 --> 05:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
here today from New Hampshire who has
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of being with a loved
 
05:31:09.788 --> 05:31:09.798 align:start position:0%
one who is able able to die peacefully
 
05:31:11.590 --> 05:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
because they had the option of Medical
 
05:31:14.590 --> 05:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying I invite you to ask me any
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
05:31:20.310 --> 05:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
experience and also about how difficult
 
05:31:22.190 --> 05:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
it was to arrange in
 
05:31:26.430 --> 05:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont we were very very lucky in
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
closing I want you to know that I will
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
continue to fight for this cause until
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
the day that I die why because I believe
 
05:31:39.510 --> 05:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
in this option for those who are dying
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
and I also promised my husband that I
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
would fight for it thank
 
05:31:46.830 --> 05:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:55.788 --> 05:31:55.798 align:start position:0%
tibo next will be representative
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you for being here today I'm
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
Norman TBO I live in Bedford New
 
05:32:04.030 --> 05:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I speak in opposition to this
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill in 2012 I got a shock both my
 
05:32:10.230 --> 05:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
Urology in Nashua and Dana Farber in
 
05:32:12.750 --> 05:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
Boston conferred concurred there was an
 
05:32:15.788 --> 05:32:15.798 align:start position:0%
85% chance an aggressive form of cancer
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
would spread through my body if not
 
05:32:17.360 --> 05:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
would spread through my body if not
treated

05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
treated
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
immediately what if this assisted
 
05:32:23.470 --> 05:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
suicide law had been in effect would my
 
05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
insurance company have authorized the 42
 
05:32:27.788 --> 05:32:27.798 align:start position:0%
radiation treatments over a two-month
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
period at a cost of a quarter of a
 
05:32:32.310 --> 05:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars what would their
 
05:32:34.310 --> 05:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
threshold be in determining whether my
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
treatment was worth
 
05:32:42.030 --> 05:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
it 75% chance of spread 80 90 with
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
suicide available as an option an
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence certainly would
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
be insurance companies and health care
 
05:32:50.350 --> 05:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
providers weighing the benefit of
 
05:32:52.310 --> 05:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
authorizing procedures against the
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
dollar cost and Lely
 
05:32:56.910 --> 05:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
survival would I have fallen into the
 
05:32:59.868 --> 05:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
six-month window I don't know because we
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have that discussion there was
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
immediate agreement between my insurance
 
05:33:05.868 --> 05:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
and Dana Farber that my treatment would
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
proceed immediately
 
05:33:11.030 --> 05:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
as it turns out I was classified by my
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
urologist several years later has no
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
evidence of disease I guess I'm a
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:21.708 --> 05:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
15% this law had been in effect and my
 
05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
prognosis fell within that six-month
 
05:33:25.750 --> 05:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
window and my insurance company had
 
05:33:29.548 --> 05:33:29.558 align:start position:0%
deemed my uh treatment not authorized I
 
05:33:32.590 --> 05:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
would have had three options in my mind
 
05:33:34.350 --> 05:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
first deny the treatment and just take
 
05:33:34.360 --> 05:33:35.270 align:start position:0%
first deny the treatment and just take
my

05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
chances second pay for treatment out of
 
05:33:40.110 --> 05:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
pocket and use my entire life savings at
 
05:33:40.120 --> 05:33:40.910 align:start position:0%
pocket and use my entire life savings at
the

05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
time three take advantage of the suicide
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
option saving my life savings for my
 
05:33:46.878 --> 05:33:48.110 align:start position:0%
option saving my life savings for my
heirs

05:33:48.110 --> 05:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
heirs
 
05:33:50.830 --> 05:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
maybe this law would create incentives
 
05:33:53.190 --> 05:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
for patients like me insurance companies
 
05:33:55.708 --> 05:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
and healthc care providers to seriously
 
05:33:57.788 --> 05:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
consider death as a viable alternative
 
05:33:57.798 --> 05:33:58.548 align:start position:0%
consider death as a viable alternative
to

05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:34:00.670 --> 05:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
treatment the patient would be under
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous stress as to what to do
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
should I put myself through treatment
 
05:34:05.948 --> 05:34:05.958 align:start position:0%
should I use up my children's
 
05:34:09.070 --> 05:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
inheritance just to stay alive a little
 
05:34:11.948 --> 05:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
longer in reality anyone qualifying
 
05:34:13.948 --> 05:34:13.958 align:start position:0%
under this law would be faced with these
 
05:34:17.230 --> 05:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
decisions consciously or unconsciously
 
05:34:19.708 --> 05:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
and not just the patients their whole
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
families would have to deal with these
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
issues quite possibly creating conflicts
 
05:34:26.590 --> 05:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
that channel their thoughts to should
 
05:34:30.190 --> 05:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
mom or dad end it now rather than let's
 
05:34:31.948 --> 05:34:31.958 align:start position:0%
enjoy the time we have
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
left how many families would be torn
 
05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
apart as the patient is guilted into
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
ending their life am I being selfish by
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
living while this bill is intended to
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
show compassion it has the potential to
 
05:34:48.670 --> 05:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
create incentivization and pressure
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
coercion I urge you to consider the
 
05:34:57.910 --> 05:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this bill
 
05:34:59.548 --> 05:34:59.558 align:start position:0%
please do not let this become New
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wall we should support living
 
05:35:04.868 --> 05:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
and compassionate treatment not time sir
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
you could just one sentence wrap up all
 
05:35:08.910 --> 05:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
right I have one question for the
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors and the supporters of this
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
bill who appointed you God thank you
 
05:35:16.590 --> 05:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
05:35:19.230 --> 05:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative Perez thank you
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question you
 
05:35:23.230 --> 05:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned insurance companies presently
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare and insurance companies do not
 
05:35:28.510 --> 05:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
pay for this option do you have a
 
05:35:32.270 --> 05:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
concern that if we put this in as an
 
05:35:34.670 --> 05:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
option for people that um insurance
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
companies might look at this and
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
withhold old insurance benefits for
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
people who might have terminal
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
illnesses yes I do they make those
 
05:35:44.558 --> 05:35:46.830 align:start position:0%
illnesses yes I do they make those
determinations

05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
now with this in effect there's an
 
05:35:52.030 --> 05:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
incentive of
 
05:35:54.030 --> 05:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
course thank
 
05:36:02.310 --> 05:36:02.320 align:start position:0%

sure you guys have heard um many many
 
05:36:24.628 --> 05:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
different reasons my reason is personal
 
05:36:27.788 --> 05:36:27.798 align:start position:0%
I just don't feel like it's necessary
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
um I have had the pleasure in sadness of
 
05:36:38.470 --> 05:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
watching loved ones pass and through
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
hospice uh my nana uh passed and they
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
kept her comfortable on morphine and she
 
05:36:47.350 --> 05:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
lived for about 4 days and she was
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
asleep and never woke up um another
 
05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
another very good friend in hospice uh
 
05:36:56.110 --> 05:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
past of Co pneumonia um up in
 
05:36:58.510 --> 05:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
dartmouth's hospital house which was um
 
05:37:00.350 --> 05:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
incredible I just don't feel like there
 
05:37:03.670 --> 05:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
is a there is a need for this bill I
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
have um I have seen the the entire
 
05:37:10.590 --> 05:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
process from that terminal point um in
 
05:37:13.948 --> 05:37:13.958 align:start position:0%
the level of Grace and love and keeping
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
people comfortable and and taking the
 
05:37:18.830 --> 05:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
complete religious component out of this
 
05:37:21.510 --> 05:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
I just I don't see a need
 
05:37:24.830 --> 05:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh and being there with my nana
 
05:37:26.750 --> 05:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
and realizing that there was nothing
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that rarely I could do um it was it was
 
05:37:33.070 --> 05:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
hard for me so I just I think this as
 
05:37:34.990 --> 05:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard this opens up a door to a
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
slippery slope and I just don't find it
 
05:37:39.868 --> 05:37:39.878 align:start position:0%
necessary in New Hampshire I've I've
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
been there I've been bedside um when you
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a terminal endless uh that the
 
05:37:48.270 --> 05:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
doctors and um and caretakers in the
 
05:37:50.430 --> 05:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
state are fully incredible especially in
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
hospice and um and it's already I think
 
05:37:56.470 --> 05:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
we already have a pathway to peacefully
 
05:37:58.868 --> 05:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
and gracefully dying in New Hampshire
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
any questions at all seeing none thank
 
05:38:17.948 --> 05:38:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:17.958 --> 05:38:19.310 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:38:21.628 --> 05:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for the opportunity
 
05:38:23.470 --> 05:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
to speak today my name is the Reverend
 
05:38:27.230 --> 05:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
Peter friedricks I am a resident of keen
 
05:38:30.750 --> 05:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
and I am a retired unarian Universalist
 
05:38:33.468 --> 05:38:33.478 align:start position:0%
Minister I'm also a current member of
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
the board of the New Hampshire Alliance
 
05:38:37.990 --> 05:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
for end of life options and I am a
 
05:38:38.000 --> 05:38:40.110 align:start position:0%
for end of life options and I am a
hospice

05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
hospice
 
05:38:44.110 --> 05:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer as a church pastor I have sat
 
05:38:46.948 --> 05:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
at the bedside of the sick and suffering
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
those enduring horrific pain as they
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
face the end of their
 
05:38:54.270 --> 05:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
lives it is true that every one of them
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
every one of them wishes to go on living
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
full and productive lives if only their
 
05:39:02.670 --> 05:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
health could be
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
restored every life is precious but the
 
05:39:08.548 --> 05:39:08.558 align:start position:0%
value of a life is not measured solely
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
in its longevity quality counts and for
 
05:39:14.070 --> 05:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
many of those who know that they will
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
never recover their only wish their
 
05:39:21.070 --> 05:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
dying wish is to have some control over
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
when and how their lives will end HB 254
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
would offer those who were facing the
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
end of their lives with that
 
05:39:30.360 --> 05:39:32.110 align:start position:0%
end of their lives with that
control

05:39:32.110 --> 05:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
hb24 is modeled after the legislation
 
05:39:36.468 --> 05:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
passed in 10 other states and
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the United States that
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
have stood the test of time there is
 
05:39:43.788 --> 05:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
demonstrated evidence that Medical Aid
 
05:39:46.670 --> 05:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
in dying supports a small percentage of
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
terminally ill cognitively competent
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
patients in their decision to bring
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
their lives to an end peacefully
 
05:39:56.590 --> 05:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
surrounded by family and
 
05:40:00.030 --> 05:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
friends I heartily agree that we can and
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
should do better to meet the needs of
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
those with chronic illnesses and
 
05:40:06.628 --> 05:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I concede that the fear
 
05:40:08.990 --> 05:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
of those who oppose this bill is real
 
05:40:13.150 --> 05:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
the fear is real but the facts the facts
 
05:40:16.590 --> 05:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
simply do not support the fears there is
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
no evidence that Medical Aid and dying
 
05:40:21.548 --> 05:40:21.558 align:start position:0%
laws increase the rate of suicide or
 
05:40:23.468 --> 05:40:23.478 align:start position:0%
that they endanger those people who have
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
a disability or are otherwise considered
 
05:40:29.510 --> 05:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable let me repeat that because
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's important there is no evidence that
 
05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying laws increase the
 
05:40:36.990 --> 05:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
rate of suicide or that they endanger
 
05:40:39.628 --> 05:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
those people who have a disability or
 
05:40:42.670 --> 05:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
are otherwise considered vulnerable we
 
05:40:45.868 --> 05:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
are not Canada as much as our current
 
05:40:48.430 --> 05:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
president might like it to be otherwise
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
we are not Canada socially culturally or
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
legally the scope of this bill is narrow
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless important to the few to
 
05:41:00.750 --> 05:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
whom this law would apply its mere
 
05:41:03.390 --> 05:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
existence will provide Comfort even if
 
05:41:05.510 --> 05:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
they never Avail themselves of its
 
05:41:05.520 --> 05:41:07.468 align:start position:0%
they never Avail themselves of its
provisions

05:41:07.468 --> 05:41:07.478 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
05:41:10.830 --> 05:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
at its core HB 254 is a bill that places
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
compassion for the dying at the highest
 
05:41:18.110 --> 05:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
value it compels no one it endangers no
 
05:41:21.270 --> 05:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
one it simply offers a small sub sir
 
05:41:22.510 --> 05:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's your time if you want to wrap up
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
thank you it simply offers a small
 
05:41:26.390 --> 05:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
subset of those who have a terminal
 
05:41:28.750 --> 05:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
illness and are suffering unbearable
 
05:41:30.750 --> 05:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
pain the opportunity to bring their
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%

next hello thank you for taking time to
 
05:42:02.590 --> 05:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
listen to all this my name is Rod Sims
 
05:42:04.190 --> 05:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
my wife is Melinda she's in the back
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
she's the veteran um I disagree with the
 
05:42:08.590 --> 05:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
lot of what's been set up here today and
 
05:42:10.430 --> 05:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
people say there's no facts to back up
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
what people like myself say but um I
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
agree with the pretense of this bill but
 
05:42:18.510 --> 05:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
not in a way these bills end up
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
operating my wife is a I call her a data
 
05:42:22.750 --> 05:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
minor she's got a lot more professional
 
05:42:24.548 --> 05:42:24.558 align:start position:0%
sounding name for it but she's actually
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
officially recognized as an information
 
05:42:30.110 --> 05:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
researcher um two years ago when we
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
first got involved with this um she went
 
05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
and found all kinds of information about
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
maid and and we found out it started out
 
05:42:40.468 --> 05:42:40.478 align:start position:0%
in the Netherlands and how it had
 
05:42:43.030 --> 05:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
transpired and grown and morphed in the
 
05:42:44.590 --> 05:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
Netherlands and everybody says well
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pass bills to
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
get these changes made that you're
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
afraid of happening that is not the case
 
05:42:52.230 --> 05:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the Netherlands it just grew out by
 
05:42:54.270 --> 05:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
itself so now the Netherlands is
 
05:42:56.910 --> 05:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
actually having to try to get bills pass
 
05:42:58.590 --> 05:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
to rain this thing in because it's got
 
05:43:02.190 --> 05:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
so bad um I do know that paliative care
 
05:43:05.628 --> 05:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
is used for euthanizing people uh my
 
05:43:07.150 --> 05:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
wife was offered that option at one of
 
05:43:10.150 --> 05:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
of her last uh checkups they tried to
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
separate me from her so they could have
 
05:43:13.990 --> 05:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
a conversation with her about her life
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
not being worth living and they could
 
05:43:17.150 --> 05:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
give her paliative care which would help
 
05:43:19.350 --> 05:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
that life end quickly so I know that for
 
05:43:22.590 --> 05:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
a fact I know for a fact that hospice
 
05:43:24.628 --> 05:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
also euthanizes people if they wish to
 
05:43:27.070 --> 05:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
be euthanized because I have a relative
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
that works in the medical industry and
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
she's told me numerous times about that
 
05:43:31.868 --> 05:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
and she's told me numerous times that
 
05:43:35.910 --> 05:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
she's refused to give patients lethal um
 
05:43:38.190 --> 05:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
doses of drugs to to end their life
 
05:43:39.868 --> 05:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
because she didn't feel like they wanted
 
05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
that done but the hospital or whatever
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
group thought that was to their benefit
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I am very concerned about how this
 
05:43:50.270 --> 05:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
can grow I am very compassionate against
 
05:43:51.868 --> 05:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
all the people that says that they've
 
05:43:53.150 --> 05:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
lost loved ones and they suffered
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
terribly I really don't understand why
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
that happened because like I said
 
05:43:57.948 --> 05:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
hospice and palic Care can help with
 
05:44:01.468 --> 05:44:01.478 align:start position:0%
that but my concern is that if this gets
 
05:44:03.510 --> 05:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
passed it's going to take away the
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
safeguards that the little safeguards we
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
have now for people like my wife wife
 
05:44:09.788 --> 05:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
saying okay we're not going to pay for
 
05:44:11.110 --> 05:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
any more your treatments we're not going
 
05:44:13.150 --> 05:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
to pay for anything because it's cheaper
 
05:44:15.788 --> 05:44:15.798 align:start position:0%
for you to be euthanized than it is for
 
05:44:18.190 --> 05:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
us to spend money on you my wife when
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
she went started looking for all this
 
05:44:21.708 --> 05:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
maid information I had to sit and watch
 
05:44:23.310 --> 05:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
hours and hours and hours of video that
 
05:44:24.708 --> 05:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
came out of the Netherlands came out of
 
05:44:26.190 --> 05:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
Canada and stuff where people had done
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
documentaries and one that really
 
05:44:30.270 --> 05:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
shocked me was in Canada there was a
 
05:44:32.190 --> 05:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
young man he was in his early 40s he had
 
05:44:34.590 --> 05:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
been he had been diagnosed with u
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia or schizophrenic I think
 
05:44:39.070 --> 05:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
it was at the time and he'd been in the
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
system which they have uh their
 
05:44:42.468 --> 05:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
insurance up there is different from
 
05:44:45.310 --> 05:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
ours it's um Community Care medicine or
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
something I'm not sure what the term is
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
but the state pays for your care um he
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
had been in the system had done well in
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
2016 once they they brought in uh maid
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
they told him we're no longer going to
 
05:45:00.350 --> 05:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
continue your care and so he was
 
05:45:02.350 --> 05:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
basically turned out I'm sorry sir
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's your time if you want to wrap up
 
05:45:06.070 --> 05:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
but basically he was told he was worth
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
$24 million
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
in body parts and if he would take and
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
commit suicide that that would be
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
helping out the
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
Canada I'll take any questions any
 
05:45:19.310 --> 05:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
questions at all seeing none thank
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:41.110 --> 05:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay this one's going to be tough up
 
05:45:43.788 --> 05:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
Camala and I the last name is way too
 
05:45:43.798 --> 05:45:45.910 align:start position:0%
Camala and I the last name is way too
small

05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:45:49.468 --> 05:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
CH and I can't throw us through it thank
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
you I was born in Canada and I came to
 
05:46:07.390 --> 05:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
United States many years ago go and I
 
05:46:10.830 --> 05:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
never thought that I needed to become an
 
05:46:13.868 --> 05:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
American citizen because I wasn't I
 
05:46:15.070 --> 05:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
didn't care about
 
05:46:18.430 --> 05:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
voting but this year I thought I really
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
want to vote and I became a citizen well
 
05:46:25.390 --> 05:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to tell you two years ago
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
when my sister
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
Claire uh had been diagnosed with cancer
 
05:46:31.040 --> 05:46:33.310 align:start position:0%
Claire uh had been diagnosed with cancer
leukemia

05:46:33.310 --> 05:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
leukemia
 
05:46:36.510 --> 05:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
and it was difficult they of course it's
 
05:46:38.750 --> 05:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
hard a doctor to say how long you have
 
05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
to live so when her children who all
 
05:46:45.230 --> 05:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
lived far away came to be with their
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
mother at the last moment well it took a
 
05:46:52.430 --> 05:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
little too long it it was like three
 
05:46:54.868 --> 05:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
weeks and she was still alive and those
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
people needed to go back to their job
 
05:47:00.788 --> 05:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
and you know their children were little
 
05:47:05.270 --> 05:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
and so one of the of her children was
 
05:47:11.830 --> 05:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
very four this bill and uh so my sister
 
05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
was not able to do really what she
 
05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
wanted she was pushed into well you know
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
this is taking too long they didn't say
 
05:47:28.030 --> 05:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
it but the way they acted so for that
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
reason she accepted the injection that
 
05:47:33.948 --> 05:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
took her life and I am against this bill
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
of course
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
because I believe that life is from the
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
moment of conception until natural death
 
05:47:47.070 --> 05:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
and this was not natural thatb and I am
 
05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
so sorry that this we had to live
 
05:47:49.558 --> 05:47:50.628 align:start position:0%
so sorry that this we had to live
through

05:47:50.628 --> 05:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:47:54.468 --> 05:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
that and being a citizen of United
 
05:47:58.230 --> 05:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
States I really believe that we cannot
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
pass this thank
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%

05:49:34.590 --> 05:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
my life I appreciate that we are in a
 
05:49:38.590 --> 05:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
live free state I expect that I should
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
be able to live free right up until my
 
05:49:41.280 --> 05:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
be able to live free right up until my
last

05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:49:45.788 --> 05:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
breath and I don't think I need to be um
 
05:49:48.750 --> 05:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
influenced or or or persuaded by other
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
people's beliefs other people's
 
05:49:53.628 --> 05:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
religions they're not mine it's not what
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
I believe I am enjoying my life here in
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm getting great joy out
 
05:50:02.510 --> 05:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
of touring around and uh and meeting all
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
the people in our wonderful State I plan
 
05:50:07.830 --> 05:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
to live as long as I possibly can but
 
05:50:11.430 --> 05:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
when I decide that I need to stop I want
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
to live a comfortable death I do not
 
05:50:17.590 --> 05:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to drown in my own blood as other
 
05:50:20.390 --> 05:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
sufferers from lung cancer have done I
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
feel I deserve
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
that that's the end of my statement and
 
05:50:29.070 --> 05:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to answer any questions
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you it's not
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
um a question um well I guess I can say
 
05:50:37.430 --> 05:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
it as a question um wouldn't it be
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful if everyone in this room could
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity to see the work of
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
the pontine theater thank you very much
 
05:50:48.788 --> 05:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you I urge
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
your support for this bill it's
 
05:50:56.788 --> 05:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
important for so many of us thank you
 
05:51:06.670 --> 05:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.310 --> 05:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you all very very much for this
 
05:51:12.150 --> 05:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I um come today as
 
05:51:14.350 --> 05:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
of course the Roman Catholic bishop of
 
05:51:17.468 --> 05:51:17.478 align:start position:0%
Manchester responsible for the Catholic
 
05:51:20.510 --> 05:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
Community here and also other people of
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
Goodwill and speaking today I'm changing
 
05:51:25.390 --> 05:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
my text a little bit you have the
 
05:51:27.150 --> 05:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
printed text but I have to give this
 
05:51:31.110 --> 05:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
part um it was asked what would happen
 
05:51:33.948 --> 05:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
if a person had cancer and then were in
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
a car accident and what would be on the
 
05:51:38.670 --> 05:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
death certificate it anybody watch the
 
05:51:40.150 --> 05:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
TV program
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
bones I love it well it's forensic
 
05:51:46.110 --> 05:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
anthropology and what you're supposed to
 
05:51:50.030 --> 05:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
do is premortem perimortem postmortem
 
05:51:51.750 --> 05:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
premortem doesn't really work with
 
05:51:53.868 --> 05:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
anything there for the evidence
 
05:51:56.590 --> 05:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
postmortem well the person may have died
 
05:51:58.990 --> 05:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
here and fallen into a river lungs are
 
05:52:01.150 --> 05:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
not filled with water it wasn't a
 
05:52:03.350 --> 05:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
drowning we look at the forensic
 
05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
evidence right here the perimortem and
 
05:52:09.548 --> 05:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
eliminating by evidentiary and
 
05:52:13.270 --> 05:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
systematic examination this is the cause
 
05:52:16.750 --> 05:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
of death and so in the situation that
 
05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
you hypothesized it would not be the
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
cancer that was the cause of death nor
 
05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
would it be necessarily the crash but
 
05:52:26.590 --> 05:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
the traumatic injury and what was the
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
specific thing a torn order or don't it
 
05:52:30.788 --> 05:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
sound so
 
05:52:33.110 --> 05:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable these things are important
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
to take a look at so that the Integrity
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
of the death certificate would have to
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
really say cause of death ingesting of
 
05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
overdose of medication drug whatever it
 
05:52:51.548 --> 05:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
might be so that's an important fact I
 
05:52:52.910 --> 05:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
think it must
 
05:52:56.548 --> 05:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
be a reliable death certificate and
 
05:52:59.150 --> 05:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's the truth the other
 
05:53:02.548 --> 05:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
thing that's important for me is in the
 
05:53:05.990 --> 05:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill it says that the person must have
 
05:53:09.270 --> 05:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
free will and give consent and of sound
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
mind and conscious and the document will
 
05:53:17.628 --> 05:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
witness that this is the person's Free
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
Will for
 
05:53:24.670 --> 05:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
us that becomes a very serious issue for
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
a Catholic human being and a Catholic
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
Church why because for time in
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
Memorial the conditions for a mortal sin
 
05:53:36.910 --> 05:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
and Catholics will understand this
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
others may not and that's all right but
 
05:53:39.948 --> 05:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
this is our
 
05:53:43.230 --> 05:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
situation the conditions for mortal sin
 
05:53:46.510 --> 05:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
that the person knows it is Gravely
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
wrong that the full consent of the will
 
05:53:51.910 --> 05:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
I choose this I want to do this no
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
matter and then actually committing the
 
05:53:58.190 --> 05:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
ACT what will happen is as we've had
 
05:54:01.390 --> 05:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
suicides many times and we we say it's
 
05:54:04.230 --> 05:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
the the poor person was tragically upset
 
05:54:06.510 --> 05:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
not in the right mind we offer the the
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
mass there's compassion we do everything
 
05:54:11.830 --> 05:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
we can what this bill will I apologize
 
05:54:13.390 --> 05:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
Bishop but that's your time if you want
 
05:54:16.590 --> 05:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
to give a one sentence sure very quickly
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
this bill will be actually making a very
 
05:54:20.990 --> 05:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
very terrible situation and a disclaimer
 
05:54:22.510 --> 05:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
would have to be in any kind of
 
05:54:24.190 --> 05:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
advertising or we would have to make
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
this very clear that this is seriously
 
05:54:29.390 --> 05:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
wrong for a Catholic to inv be involved
 
05:54:32.190 --> 05:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
in so it is in a sense a persecution of
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
our faith thank you any questions at all
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
05:54:38.990 --> 05:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
question Bishop we have a question if
 
05:54:40.430 --> 05:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind representative Smith
 
05:54:43.150 --> 05:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes thank thank you very much
 
05:54:45.110 --> 05:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
for being here we certainly appreciate
 
05:54:48.628 --> 05:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
it do you see anything in this bill that
 
05:54:51.110 --> 05:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
in any way would
 
05:54:55.430 --> 05:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
require um anyone to
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
participate whatever their religion is
 
05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh well do do you see any anything in
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
there oh no no it would be the person's
 
05:55:10.270 --> 05:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
choice but to be influenced to make that
 
05:55:11.628 --> 05:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
choice without realizing the
 
05:55:14.430 --> 05:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
consequences would be horrible thank you
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
good thank you so much thank
 
05:55:36.910 --> 05:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.750 --> 05:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your service to New
 
05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my name is Kelly
 
05:55:43.788 --> 05:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
rodford because of my professional
 
05:55:47.390 --> 05:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
experience I support this bill I'm a
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
board certified licensed massage
 
05:55:52.670 --> 05:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
therapist with 25 years experience and a
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
specialty supporting those with terminal
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis I am also an end of life Doula
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
and have been a respected team member of
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
a local hospice
 
05:56:06.830 --> 05:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
agency nobody wants to talk about
 
05:56:06.840 --> 05:56:08.310 align:start position:0%
agency nobody wants to talk about
gruesome

05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
gruesome
 
05:56:11.468 --> 05:56:11.478 align:start position:0%
death but there are certain types of
 
05:56:13.948 --> 05:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
conditions that the amazing tools of
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
hospice care can't
 
05:56:19.628 --> 05:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
manage I'm going to say that again there
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
are certain types of conditions that the
 
05:56:23.628 --> 05:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
amazing tools of hospice care can't
 
05:56:27.788 --> 05:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
manage bleeding to death is one of these
 
05:56:29.868 --> 05:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
this is because some Types of cancerous
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
tumors can't be managed in ways that
 
05:56:34.510 --> 05:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
prevent them from
 
05:56:37.310 --> 05:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
rupturing I have been and hospice team
 
05:56:39.510 --> 05:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
meetings where colleagues discussed
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
needing to tell a patient and their
 
05:56:46.750 --> 05:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
loved ones to buy red or dark towels in
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
preparation for their
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
death so imagine this for yourself or
 
05:56:55.788 --> 05:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
your loved one you have a terminal
 
05:56:58.948 --> 05:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
cancer and your hospice nurse tells you
 
05:57:02.230 --> 05:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
to have dark towels on hand to prepare
 
05:57:03.310 --> 05:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
death why because the risk that your
 
05:57:10.390 --> 05:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
inoperable cancer cancerous tumor will
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
rupture and will cause you to bleed to
 
05:57:15.590 --> 05:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
death the dark towels will help to
 
05:57:17.430 --> 05:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
disguise the blood from your dying
 
05:57:19.230 --> 05:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
process so that this will be less
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
distressing for you and your loved ones
 
05:57:21.680 --> 05:57:22.430 align:start position:0%
distressing for you and your loved ones
to

05:57:22.430 --> 05:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:26.190 --> 05:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
witness this is horrific and this is
 
05:57:29.990 --> 05:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
tragic bleeding to death is inhumane it
 
05:57:32.310 --> 05:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
is terrifying to the dying person and
 
05:57:34.628 --> 05:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
deeply traumatic for their loved ones
 
05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
which adds even more heartache and grief
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um I oppose this bill I ask
 
05:58:33.868 --> 05:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
you to oppose it uh because it's
 
05:58:36.430 --> 05:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
problematic on many levels and I'll
 
05:58:39.230 --> 05:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
address uh some of the sections in the
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%

05:58:53.510 --> 05:58:53.520 align:start position:0%

this role has a certification or a
 
05:58:58.510 --> 05:58:58.520 align:start position:0%

05:59:01.708 --> 05:59:01.718 align:start position:0%
person can prescribe Medical Aid in

pursuant to this chapter or consent of

any treatment at any time so the
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
question is how can anyone who after
 
06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
taking the Pres prescribed pills
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%

06:00:14.030 --> 06:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
is no detail about what happens after
 
06:00:15.830 --> 06:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
the person has taken the
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
pills what if they're unable to speak or
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
unable to move any part of their body
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible that people have
 
06:00:26.990 --> 06:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
second thoughts after taking the the
 
06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%

to a qualified individual who may self
 
06:00:44.310 --> 06:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
administer the medications what is the
 
06:00:47.150 --> 06:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
definition of a qualified
 
06:00:49.868 --> 06:00:49.878 align:start position:0%

pressuring the elderly as we heard from
 
06:01:21.708 --> 06:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
Camila the premise of this bill is to
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
give indiv individuals who fear a future
 
06:01:27.310 --> 06:01:27.320 align:start position:0%

didn't change a bit they continue to
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%

06:06:28.510 --> 06:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to die if they had any medical
 
06:06:30.310 --> 06:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
condition at all they were starved to
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
death I don't believe that anyone in who
 
06:06:35.310 --> 06:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
supports this bill Who's involved in
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
this Bill wishes people with
 
06:06:38.468 --> 06:06:38.478 align:start position:0%
disabilities any harm I don't believe
 
06:06:40.270 --> 06:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
that for a second but it doesn't mean it
 
06:06:42.670 --> 06:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
won't happen as then Governor Maggie
 
06:06:44.670 --> 06:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
Hassen who has personal experience with
 
06:06:47.310 --> 06:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
this issue with disability issues stated
 
06:06:49.910 --> 06:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
in her June 2015 veto message for House
 
06:06:52.590 --> 06:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 151 which would have established a
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee to study end of life decisions
 
06:06:57.150 --> 06:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
I believe that the goal of this bill
 
06:06:58.788 --> 06:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
begins to take New Hampshire down a
 
06:07:02.430 --> 06:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
precarious path the ama's code of ethics
 
06:07:04.830 --> 06:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
defines assisted suicide as when a bill
 
06:07:06.868 --> 06:07:06.878 align:start position:0%
when a physician facilitates a patient's
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
death by providing the necessary means
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
Andor information to enable the patient
 
06:07:13.788 --> 06:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
to perform the life-ending act that is
 
06:07:17.030 --> 06:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill allows the AMA
 
06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
the National Council on disability and
 
06:07:21.070 --> 06:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
many other prominent National disability
 
06:07:23.150 --> 06:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
organizations oppose physicians
 
06:07:26.590 --> 06:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
assistant Su suicide bills in their
 
06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
report on the dangers of um to people
 
06:07:31.110 --> 06:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
with disabilities of legalizing suicide
 
06:07:33.190 --> 06:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
the National Council on disability notes
 
06:07:34.750 --> 06:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
that those bills tend to contain
 
06:07:36.468 --> 06:07:36.478 align:start position:0%
provisions included intended to
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
safeguard patients from problems or
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
abuse however their research showed that
 
06:07:42.590 --> 06:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
these Provisions are ineffective and
 
06:07:44.350 --> 06:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
often fail to protect patients in a
 
06:07:46.990 --> 06:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
variety of ways including that insurers
 
06:07:49.430 --> 06:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
have Divi have denied expensive life-
 
06:07:51.788 --> 06:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
sustaining medical treatment but offered
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
to subsidize legal drugs instead I've
 
06:07:56.868 --> 06:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
included several examples in my in my
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony people with
 
06:08:00.510 --> 06:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities and other marginalized
 
06:08:02.070 --> 06:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
groups are particularly vulnerable to
 
06:08:04.270 --> 06:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
Social and financial coercion to choose
 
06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
the Physicians assist suicide due to a
 
06:08:09.150 --> 06:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
lack of Support Services family members
 
06:08:11.230 --> 06:08:11.240 align:start position:0%

Washington and Oregon found that half of
 
06:08:19.830 --> 06:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
the people who sought lethal drugs
 
06:08:22.110 --> 06:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
through physici assisted suicide
 
06:08:23.868 --> 06:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
reported being a burden on family
 
06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
friends and caregivers as their primary
 
06:08:27.788 --> 06:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
reasons that's definitely that's a
 
06:08:29.830 --> 06:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
serious problem but there are better
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
Solutions than this one the US C
 
06:08:34.270 --> 06:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
Conference of Catholic Bishops states
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
that Medical Aid and dying SL assisted
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
suicide Fosters discrimination by
 
06:08:40.990 --> 06:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
creating two classes of people those
 
06:08:43.150 --> 06:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
suici whose suicides we spend hundreds
 
06:08:44.788 --> 06:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars each year to
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
prevent and those who suicides we assist
 
06:08:49.788 --> 06:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
and treat as positive good suicide is
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
the second leading cause of death among
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
10 to 30 year olds in New Hampshire and
 
06:08:55.590 --> 06:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
because of sorry that is your time if
 
06:08:57.990 --> 06:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
you want suicide cont contagion means
 
06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
that suicide increases when bills like
 
06:09:01.548 --> 06:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
this are passed we don't want that
 
06:09:05.788 --> 06:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
please recommend I any questions see n

work and Ministry it was my deep
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
privilege to be with many dear people
 
06:09:38.310 --> 06:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
people at the end of their lives far too
 
06:09:41.350 --> 06:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
many experienced unrelieved forms of
 
06:09:43.948 --> 06:09:43.958 align:start position:0%
suffering even with hospice
 
06:09:47.590 --> 06:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
care my beloved husband Bob was one of
 
06:09:51.390 --> 06:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
them he was a lifelong advocate for
 
06:09:53.590 --> 06:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and devoted his
 
06:09:57.150 --> 06:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
professional life to that he experienced
 
06:09:59.510 --> 06:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
a traumatic death that he had dearly
 
06:10:02.910 --> 06:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
hoped to avoid he had a terminal illness
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and would have qualified for Medical Aid
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
and dying under this law but because we
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
live here it was not there for
 
06:10:15.468 --> 06:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
him even with hospice care great hospice
 
06:10:19.868 --> 06:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
care and all the love and support I and
 
06:10:22.510 --> 06:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
my kids and grandkids and friends and
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful community and church offered
 
06:10:28.788 --> 06:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
Bob he endured unrelieved pain and other
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
terrible forms of
 
06:10:34.468 --> 06:10:34.478 align:start position:0%
suffering no one like Bob who qualifies
 
06:10:37.708 --> 06:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
for Ma should have to die the way he
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
did this goes right to the heart of the
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
question of conscience of course and in
 
06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
my view as a clergy woman Medical Aid in
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
dying as described under this law is a
 
06:10:51.708 --> 06:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
deeply compassionate highly ethical
 
06:10:54.750 --> 06:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
caring option for those who desire it
 
06:10:56.468 --> 06:10:56.478 align:start position:0%
and who have gone through the rigorous
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
and extensively safeguarded qualifying
 
06:11:02.468 --> 06:11:02.478 align:start position:0%
process including of course the ability
 
06:11:05.708 --> 06:11:05.718 align:start position:0%
to self- inest the liquid medication
 
06:11:08.670 --> 06:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
there are no injections or pills as it's
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
practiced in our
 
06:11:14.030 --> 06:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
country it is an act of Loving Care to
 
06:11:16.030 --> 06:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
allow a suffering dying person the
 
06:11:18.590 --> 06:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
option of choosing a peaceful painless
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
death I respect other religious
 
06:11:24.430 --> 06:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
objections to this option but folks who
 
06:11:26.990 --> 06:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
have those concerns need not pursue it
 
06:11:31.390 --> 06:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
in any way no one can compel anyone to
 
06:11:33.350 --> 06:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
participate in this in any way who
 
06:11:35.670 --> 06:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't wish to
 
06:11:37.948 --> 06:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
the state should not stand in the way of
 
06:11:40.190 --> 06:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
terminally ill folks having the freedom
 
06:11:43.230 --> 06:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
to choose this gentle caring option for
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
oneself and I will leave you with this
 
06:11:48.750 --> 06:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
question who
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
benefits When someone like my dear
 
06:11:54.830 --> 06:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful husband who fought so hard to
 
06:11:57.788 --> 06:11:57.798 align:start position:0%
live and finally understood and that
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
made peace with the fact that his
 
06:12:03.150 --> 06:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
disease would kill him who
 
06:12:05.708 --> 06:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
benefits When someone like that that
 
06:12:07.830 --> 06:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
whose sound of
 
06:12:12.350 --> 06:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
Mind suffering agonally and facing the
 
06:12:16.150 --> 06:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
prospect of a very traumatic death who
 
06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
benefits When a man like that that's
 
06:12:21.948 --> 06:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
your time if you can bleeds out in a
 
06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
fire hose of blood through his
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
tracheostomy and drowns in his own blood
 
06:12:29.948 --> 06:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night who benefits
 
06:12:34.390 --> 06:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
from that no one thank you any questions
 
06:12:36.910 --> 06:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
at all thank
 
06:12:49.310 --> 06:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.070 --> 06:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
leran hi my name is Alexander landrian
 
06:12:53.468 --> 06:12:53.478 align:start position:0%
and I live in
 
06:12:56.270 --> 06:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
Madbury suicide is an issue that has
 
06:12:58.750 --> 06:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
deeply impacted My Generation not that
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
that's a shock to anyone here we've
 
06:13:02.788 --> 06:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
heard stories all throughout this
 
06:13:05.548 --> 06:13:05.558 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone's been touched by in
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
some way and I know the sound of those
 
06:13:10.910 --> 06:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
devastating phone calls all too well in
 
06:13:12.350 --> 06:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
high school a close friend of mine
 
06:13:14.628 --> 06:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide I was the one who
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
called 911 and I beat the ambulance to
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
her house more than a decade later in
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
that crisp fall afternoon is still
 
06:13:25.030 --> 06:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
seared into my brain with each passing
 
06:13:27.310 --> 06:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
year suicide has become more and more
 
06:13:29.590 --> 06:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
prevalent as someone who has spent much
 
06:13:32.150 --> 06:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
of my adult life working with teenagers
 
06:13:34.070 --> 06:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
I shared the grave concern that many
 
06:13:35.670 --> 06:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
adults feel
 
06:13:37.708 --> 06:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
the CDC reports that it's the second
 
06:13:39.750 --> 06:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
leading leading cause of death for 10 to
 
06:13:43.788 --> 06:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
24 year olds with a 62% increase from
 
06:13:45.390 --> 06:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
2007 to
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
2021 lgbtq plus youth are nearly four
 
06:13:51.230 --> 06:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
times more likely to attempt suicide
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%

06:13:56.310 --> 06:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
to the Trevor Project's 2024 survey
 
06:13:58.468 --> 06:13:58.478 align:start position:0%
we're facing an epidemic and now we're
 
06:14:00.310 --> 06:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
going to legalize this by giving
 
06:14:02.750 --> 06:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with terminal illness
 
06:14:05.628 --> 06:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying medication I urge
 
06:14:07.468 --> 06:14:07.478 align:start position:0%
us all to consider the broader
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
implications by passing this bill we
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
send a message intended or not that
 
06:14:15.468 --> 06:14:15.478 align:start position:0%
there are circumstances where suicide is
 
06:14:17.310 --> 06:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable and even
 
06:14:19.468 --> 06:14:19.478 align:start position:0%
dignified how do I explain this to the
 
06:14:21.868 --> 06:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
teenagers that I work with what happens
 
06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
when the law not only legalizes suicide
 
06:14:27.390 --> 06:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
but Champions it the Bill's safeguards
 
06:14:29.788 --> 06:14:29.798 align:start position:0%
Overlook the most significant factor in
 
06:14:32.948 --> 06:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
suicide the human mind feelings of being
 
06:14:36.030 --> 06:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
a burden pressure loss of selfworth
 
06:14:39.110 --> 06:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
those can't be legislated away suicide
 
06:14:41.310 --> 06:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't care about safety mechanisms
 
06:14:43.110 --> 06:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
anyone working with teens know that
 
06:14:44.910 --> 06:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
culture matters just as much to them as
 
06:14:47.310 --> 06:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
the law and what culture does this bill
 
06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
create the message will reach far beyond
 
06:14:52.030 --> 06:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
those with six months to live if we
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
normalize suicide even in the case of
 
06:14:57.070 --> 06:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
terminal illness we risk eroding the
 
06:14:59.230 --> 06:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
strong cultural and moral stance we
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
fought to build against it we risk
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
inadvertently reinforcing the idea that
 
06:15:05.750 --> 06:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
life is Expendable when becomes
 
06:15:08.548 --> 06:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
difficult instead of a expanding access
 
06:15:10.708 --> 06:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
to Suicide we should invest in paliative
 
06:15:13.310 --> 06:15:13.320 align:start position:0%

06:17:16.350 --> 06:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound

two days later his death was
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
precipitated by his inability to Contin
 
06:17:25.990 --> 06:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
to continue enduring the severe physical
 
06:17:29.230 --> 06:17:29.240 align:start position:0%

that I wrote about it was various uh
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
ways that people would research and
 
06:21:49.708 --> 06:21:49.718 align:start position:0%
attempt to end their life when they

about did happen to my father and he

06:22:08.110 --> 06:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
clear difference between suicide the
 
06:22:10.868 --> 06:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
word suicide when we use it and when we
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
are struggling with emotional pain
 
06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
versus physical
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
pain there's a lot of treatment that we
 
06:22:19.150 --> 06:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
have for emotional pain and there's
 
06:22:21.708 --> 06:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
always room in the future to grow and
 
06:22:24.030 --> 06:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
heal and manage that pain and reduce the
 
06:22:26.670 --> 06:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
suffering this is very different when we
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
talk about medically assisted suicide
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
when it categorizes you in physical pain
 
06:22:35.990 --> 06:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the category of terminal illness and
 
06:22:37.830 --> 06:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
additionally within that six-month
 
06:22:40.830 --> 06:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
estimate in hospice care they're very
 
06:22:44.310 --> 06:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
different I have training in end of life
 
06:22:48.468 --> 06:22:48.478 align:start position:0%
and grief and family Dynamics and I
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
would be able to utilize that with my
 
06:22:52.948 --> 06:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
colleagues to increase the amount of
 
06:22:55.628 --> 06:22:55.638 align:start position:0%
safety if this bill were to be utilized
 
06:22:57.468 --> 06:22:57.478 align:start position:0%
and I would be very willing to take
 
06:23:01.070 --> 06:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
additional training um to increase a
 
06:23:03.390 --> 06:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
specific Niche for this if we pass the
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
bill um that medical providers can
 
06:23:08.230 --> 06:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
assist families in making the right
 
06:23:12.868 --> 06:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
choice um lastly I completed oh and also
 
06:23:14.468 --> 06:23:14.478 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we we take a lot of
 
06:23:16.670 --> 06:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
Ethics courses to maintain our license
 
06:23:21.708 --> 06:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
and um supervision on on such things so
 
06:23:23.350 --> 06:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
people should have an area of expertise
 
06:23:26.030 --> 06:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
would be the most ethical um and lastly
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
I spent an entire year becoming
 
06:23:30.468 --> 06:23:30.478 align:start position:0%
certified in psychedelic assisted
 
06:23:32.590 --> 06:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
therapy uh we can only utilize this in
 
06:23:34.628 --> 06:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
our state through ketamine at this time
 
06:23:37.070 --> 06:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
and we're waiting for other medicines to
 
06:23:40.708 --> 06:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
come online legally um but psychedelic
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
assisted therapy is very um profound in
 
06:23:46.948 --> 06:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
helping existential crisis with the end
 
06:23:49.390 --> 06:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
of life as well as PTSD and treatment
 
06:23:53.230 --> 06:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
resistant depression um I plan to uh
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
continue to utilize this and help
 
06:23:58.708 --> 06:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
families and connect with local uh end
 
06:24:01.750 --> 06:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
of life duas or death duas in the state
 
06:24:03.150 --> 06:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
and I feel that passing this bill would
 
06:24:05.990 --> 06:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
be a trifecta of care in that they could
 
06:24:08.270 --> 06:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
have a prescription uh to give them
 
06:24:09.708 --> 06:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
peace of mind and they don't have to
 
06:24:11.548 --> 06:24:11.558 align:start position:0%
fill the prescription or use the
 
06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
prescription until they need to um but
 
06:24:15.948 --> 06:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate that as a
 
06:24:17.430 --> 06:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider and the mental
 
06:24:19.910 --> 06:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
health specifically we are trying to
 
06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
have the most ethical standards for
 
06:24:23.910 --> 06:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
people that need it and it wouldn't be
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
misused any questions at all and my
 
06:24:29.230 --> 06:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
closing statement is just that um as we
 
06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
come into this world our our birth
 
06:24:33.430 --> 06:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
journey is medically assisted and that
 
06:24:35.628 --> 06:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
is to make it more comfort aable and
 
06:24:37.708 --> 06:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
safe and so our death Journey should be
 
06:24:40.270 --> 06:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
medically assisted so it is safe and
 
06:24:43.110 --> 06:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
more comfortable thank you thank
 
06:24:52.830 --> 06:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:55.750 --> 06:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
Nelson my name my name is Father Andrew
 
06:24:57.590 --> 06:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
Nelson I'm from summersworth and thank
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
you to the committee for listening for
 
06:25:01.030 --> 06:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
all of us with all of us today in my
 
06:25:03.070 --> 06:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
work as a priest I've attended over a
 
06:25:05.670 --> 06:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
thousand deaths I've attended even more
 
06:25:07.310 --> 06:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
people who are suffering and struggling
 
06:25:09.150 --> 06:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
throughout their life I've served at the
 
06:25:10.430 --> 06:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
number one Hospital in the world and
 
06:25:12.788 --> 06:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
seen some of the most complicated cases
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
the conversation that happens when the
 
06:25:16.468 --> 06:25:16.478 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses leave and when the
 
06:25:19.390 --> 06:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
family leaves too and when the person
 
06:25:20.830 --> 06:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
like myself comes in the room and who's
 
06:25:23.548 --> 06:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
only there to listen and to company the
 
06:25:25.468 --> 06:25:25.478 align:start position:0%
number one thing I hear is not a wish
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
that one had more money or any of those
 
06:25:30.350 --> 06:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
things the number one thing I hear from
 
06:25:32.708 --> 06:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
people at suffering at the end of life
 
06:25:33.948 --> 06:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
is the worry they have for those that
 
06:25:37.150 --> 06:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
leave behind including many I suspect in
 
06:25:39.390 --> 06:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
this room have experienced that the
 
06:25:41.430 --> 06:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
worry for those they would leave behind
 
06:25:42.910 --> 06:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
the worry that they've been a burden
 
06:25:44.070 --> 06:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
because they've been suffering and
 
06:25:46.110 --> 06:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
struggling through so much throughout
 
06:25:47.468 --> 06:25:47.478 align:start position:0%
the end of their
 
06:25:49.670 --> 06:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
life at the heart of
 
06:25:54.110 --> 06:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
suicide is pressure and culture and this
 
06:25:56.628 --> 06:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing to protect those who
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
are vulnerable from either the heart of
 
06:26:01.868 --> 06:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
suicide is The Whispers that come in
 
06:26:04.468 --> 06:26:04.478 align:start position:0%
one's mind that they're a burden that
 
06:26:06.468 --> 06:26:06.478 align:start position:0%
there people don't want them around or
 
06:26:07.868 --> 06:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
that they're tired with them or even
 
06:26:09.788 --> 06:26:09.798 align:start position:0%
that the suffering which can be intense
 
06:26:11.390 --> 06:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
and Beyond things that any of us here
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
can understand are very real but that
 
06:26:18.070 --> 06:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
pressure and culture around one who is
 
06:26:20.788 --> 06:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
suffering and behind and around every
 
06:26:23.468 --> 06:26:23.478 align:start position:0%
single suicide whether for those
 
06:26:25.628 --> 06:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
assisted in dying or assisted Physicians
 
06:26:27.868 --> 06:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide or those who are young
 
06:26:30.190 --> 06:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
people it's the same Whispers And the
 
06:26:32.910 --> 06:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
same pressure and no safeguards in law
 
06:26:34.868 --> 06:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
can protect people from that
 
06:26:36.990 --> 06:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
and the danger of legalizing physician
 
06:26:39.548 --> 06:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
assist to a suicide is it sends a clear
 
06:26:42.270 --> 06:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
message that the answering to suffering
 
06:26:42.280 --> 06:26:43.310 align:start position:0%
message that the answering to suffering
is

06:26:43.310 --> 06:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:26:45.868 --> 06:26:45.878 align:start position:0%
death everyone here on this committee
 
06:26:47.750 --> 06:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
should remember it was only a few
 
06:26:50.190 --> 06:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
decades ago that National media
 
06:26:52.270 --> 06:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
descended on gtown high school and it
 
06:26:54.350 --> 06:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
was called suicide High because they had
 
06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
a contagion of Youth suicide because one
 
06:26:59.390 --> 06:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
youth committed suicide and the next
 
06:27:01.708 --> 06:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
said well I'm struggling too so it's not
 
06:27:03.910 --> 06:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
a a bad idea and the next thing you know
 
06:27:05.948 --> 06:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
the ideas is implanted in the hearts and
 
06:27:08.270 --> 06:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
the minds of the vulnerable some people
 
06:27:10.350 --> 06:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
here have said a physician assist with
 
06:27:12.390 --> 06:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
suicide doesn't increase the likelihood
 
06:27:13.590 --> 06:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
that those around them will commit
 
06:27:16.350 --> 06:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
suicide the nhi study actually isn't the
 
06:27:18.788 --> 06:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
contrary to that if your spouse commits
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
suicide the likelihood that that person
 
06:27:22.788 --> 06:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
will commit suicide increases by
 
06:27:25.190 --> 06:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
300% if it's a member of your family the
 
06:27:27.510 --> 06:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
nhi study says
 
06:27:31.948 --> 06:27:31.958 align:start position:0%
200% culture and pressure are real and
 
06:27:34.590 --> 06:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
we send a direct message that we're okay
 
06:27:36.670 --> 06:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
without those who are suffering when we
 
06:27:39.030 --> 06:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
legalize something like that despite all
 
06:27:41.190 --> 06:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
the good intention and I think everyone
 
06:27:43.948 --> 06:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
here has good intention in their heart
 
06:27:45.708 --> 06:27:45.718 align:start position:0%
but that pressure and all those things
 
06:27:48.190 --> 06:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
are real if you had asked me when I was
 
06:27:50.310 --> 06:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
in high school would culture ever shift
 
06:27:52.350 --> 06:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
enough that kids would worry about
 
06:27:53.948 --> 06:27:53.958 align:start position:0%
whether it' be shot at school I would
 
06:27:56.310 --> 06:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
have said you were crazy and yet we've
 
06:27:58.510 --> 06:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
watched culture that's your time if you
 
06:28:00.948 --> 06:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay can I finish for sure if You' ask
 
06:28:02.628 --> 06:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
me we'd had a culture where we worried
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
about Civil War because of political
 
06:28:06.030 --> 06:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
division I would have said such a
 
06:28:08.230 --> 06:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
cultural shift could never happen yet
 
06:28:10.390 --> 06:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
we've watched it and I would ask all of
 
06:28:13.350 --> 06:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
you to consider what cultural shift will
 
06:28:16.030 --> 06:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
happen if we legalize this bill and I
 
06:28:18.190 --> 06:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
remind you we are closer to Quebec than
 
06:28:22.750 --> 06:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
we are to Augusta Maine we're not that
 
06:28:26.310 --> 06:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
different any questions at all see none
 
06:28:26.320 --> 06:28:27.468 align:start position:0%

06:29:09.868 --> 06:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
regarding maid have changed over the
 
06:29:12.230 --> 06:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
course of my career I have always
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
believed in the personal spiritual and
 
06:29:17.628 --> 06:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
relational growth that can be achieved
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the hard work of caring for the
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
dying ma should not and cannot replace
 
06:29:23.520 --> 06:29:24.548 align:start position:0%
dying ma should not and cannot replace
this

06:29:24.548 --> 06:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:29:27.910 --> 06:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
work but my patience continue to teach
 
06:29:31.590 --> 06:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
me with rare exception and that without
 
06:29:34.990 --> 06:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
my mentioning it they have told me that
 
06:29:36.990 --> 06:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
they want the ability to have access to
 
06:29:39.468 --> 06:29:39.478 align:start position:0%
maid I have had patients of all
 
06:29:42.510 --> 06:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
spiritual Traditions abilities and
 
06:29:44.948 --> 06:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities occupations and belief
 
06:29:47.868 --> 06:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
systems including to my shock a retired
 
06:29:51.350 --> 06:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
devout Catholic nun request information
 
06:29:52.948 --> 06:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
about access to
 
06:29:56.708 --> 06:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
maid my patients don't think they will
 
06:29:59.310 --> 06:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
use maid but they want to know that it
 
06:30:02.390 --> 06:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
can be there for them if they choose
 
06:30:04.750 --> 06:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
they want the Solace comfort and sense
 
06:30:07.468 --> 06:30:07.478 align:start position:0%
of control in its
 
06:30:10.190 --> 06:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
availability as an emergency room doctor
 
06:30:13.548 --> 06:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
and palea of medicine consultant I have
 
06:30:16.190 --> 06:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
sat with many patients as they have died
 
06:30:18.030 --> 06:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
I have encountered situations of
 
06:30:20.350 --> 06:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable suffering at the deepest
 
06:30:23.990 --> 06:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
level I have seen despite best efforts
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
and best palean when dying is not
 
06:30:30.190 --> 06:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
spiritual growth but indelible
 
06:30:32.548 --> 06:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
trauma I've heard many accounts of
 
06:30:34.350 --> 06:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
patients friends and family who have
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
chosen made for some the experience is
 
06:30:37.440 --> 06:30:38.510 align:start position:0%
chosen made for some the experience is
life-altering

06:30:38.510 --> 06:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
life-altering
 
06:30:41.110 --> 06:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
for example my sister was invited to
 
06:30:43.310 --> 06:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
celebrate the life caner
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
bedbound with uncontrolled pain despite
 
06:30:46.240 --> 06:30:47.628 align:start position:0%
bedbound with uncontrolled pain despite
optimal

06:30:47.628 --> 06:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
optimal
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
pale she sat with her neighbor his wife
 
06:30:52.110 --> 06:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
and their two pre-teen children to
 
06:30:54.628 --> 06:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
celebrate his life in his last hours
 
06:30:59.350 --> 06:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
alert and aware in pain on his terms it
 
06:31:00.910 --> 06:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
was to date the most moving and
 
06:31:02.910 --> 06:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
meaningful experience of my sister's
 
06:31:02.920 --> 06:31:04.708 align:start position:0%
meaningful experience of my sister's
life

06:31:04.708 --> 06:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
life
 
06:31:07.468 --> 06:31:07.478 align:start position:0%
as chair of the hos um the Ethics
 
06:31:08.788 --> 06:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
Committee at my hospital I have
 
06:31:11.230 --> 06:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
struggled with the well documented and
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
reported ethical Arguments for and
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
against made I believe that my medical
 
06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues can uphold the carefully
 
06:31:20.510 --> 06:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
developed standards and guard guard
 
06:31:24.990 --> 06:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
veils to stop inappropriate influence or
 
06:31:28.070 --> 06:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
utilization we do not all share the same
 
06:31:30.830 --> 06:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
values my work is focused on doing all I
 
06:31:33.910 --> 06:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
can to honor my patients values and not
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
oppose my I'm sorry that's your time you
 
06:31:37.670 --> 06:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
can wrap it
 
06:31:39.948 --> 06:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
up I now believe it is our
 
06:31:41.868 --> 06:31:41.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility for those who are already
 
06:31:43.990 --> 06:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
dying to honor and support how they wish
 
06:31:46.430 --> 06:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
their final hours to be lived I hope you
 
06:31:49.270 --> 06:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
will consider carefully your role in
 
06:31:53.230 --> 06:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
this process and support
 
06:32:02.830 --> 06:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:04.670 --> 06:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
Farrell thank you members of the
 
06:32:06.708 --> 06:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
committee my name is James Farrell I'm
 
06:32:08.708 --> 06:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
from Lee New
 
06:32:12.270 --> 06:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I wish to oppose this
 
06:32:15.388 --> 06:32:15.398 align:start position:0%
bill because quite frankly it is written
 
06:32:18.190 --> 06:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
in dishonest
 
06:32:21.868 --> 06:32:21.878 align:start position:0%
language it attempts to be a bill not
 
06:32:24.468 --> 06:32:24.478 align:start position:0%
about assisted suicide when we all know
 
06:32:26.628 --> 06:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
and as many people have testified here
 
06:32:30.030 --> 06:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
it is a bill about assisted suicide and
 
06:32:32.948 --> 06:32:32.958 align:start position:0%
that the sponsors know it is proposing
 
06:32:35.788 --> 06:32:35.798 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide side is made evidence
 
06:32:38.030 --> 06:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
by the many attempts to find less
 
06:32:40.910 --> 06:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
alarming more palatable language with
 
06:32:43.270 --> 06:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
which to describe the act of a person
 
06:32:46.590 --> 06:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
taking his or her own life yet all the
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
euphemisms and rhetorical flourishes
 
06:32:52.628 --> 06:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
cannot change the underlying fact that
 
06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
this bill will codify assisted suicide
 
06:32:58.750 --> 06:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to examine the text of
 
06:33:01.750 --> 06:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and see the many attempts at
 
06:33:04.070 --> 06:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
these sort of definitional slights of
 
06:33:07.548 --> 06:33:07.558 align:start position:0%
hand according to the text quote death
 
06:33:10.070 --> 06:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
in accordance with this chapter shall
 
06:33:14.830 --> 06:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
not be designated suicide or homicide
 
06:33:17.150 --> 06:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
but indeed how does sensible people
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
Define suicide the dictionary says
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
suicide is quote the act or an instance
 
06:33:26.948 --> 06:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
of ending one's own life voluntarily or
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally and isn't that what this
 
06:33:31.868 --> 06:33:31.878 align:start position:0%
bill is permitting
 
06:33:35.190 --> 06:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
right the sponsors also know their
 
06:33:38.670 --> 06:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
proposal is morally suspect how that's
 
06:33:40.990 --> 06:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
betrayed by their insistence that the
 
06:33:43.910 --> 06:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
next in the next section of the bill
 
06:33:46.350 --> 06:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
that the death quote shall not be cause
 
06:33:49.070 --> 06:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
of death quote shall not be indicated on
 
06:33:50.310 --> 06:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the death
 
06:33:52.350 --> 06:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
certificate well why
 
06:33:55.750 --> 06:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
not if what they propose is noble and
 
06:33:57.190 --> 06:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
decent and
 
06:34:00.030 --> 06:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
civilized who could object to having a
 
06:34:04.590 --> 06:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
public record made of such a death right
 
06:34:08.750 --> 06:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
so instead the bill wants to make State
 
06:34:12.708 --> 06:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
sanctioned falsification of a vital
 
06:34:15.468 --> 06:34:15.478 align:start position:0%
record the linguistic gymnastics are
 
06:34:17.150 --> 06:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps most in evidence with the
 
06:34:19.388 --> 06:34:19.398 align:start position:0%
definitions related to healthc care we
 
06:34:21.230 --> 06:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
talk talks a lot about health care
 
06:34:24.190 --> 06:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
providers but what is Health Care Health
 
06:34:25.670 --> 06:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
Care according to the
 
06:34:28.388 --> 06:34:28.398 align:start position:0%
dictionary involves efforts made to
 
06:34:31.190 --> 06:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
maintain restore or promote someone's
 
06:34:34.310 --> 06:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
physical mental or em emotional
 
06:34:37.150 --> 06:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
well-being does this bill do any of
 
06:34:39.708 --> 06:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
those things does it Aid the dying
 
06:34:45.670 --> 06:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:48.868 --> 06:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
Health then the bill repeatedly refers
 
06:34:52.788 --> 06:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
to the Medical Aid in dying
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
medication that's a very curious way to
 
06:34:55.440 --> 06:34:57.030 align:start position:0%
medication that's a very curious way to
say

06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:35:00.070 --> 06:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
poison medicine the dictionary reminds
 
06:35:03.708 --> 06:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
us is a substance or a preparation used
 
06:35:06.468 --> 06:35:06.478 align:start position:0%
used in treating disease it's something
 
06:35:09.070 --> 06:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
that affects well-being I apologize sir
 
06:35:11.030 --> 06:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's your time give a one sentence
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
wrap I I would just encourage you to
 
06:35:16.548 --> 06:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill or at the very least
 
06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
start calling it by an honest title
 
06:35:23.430 --> 06:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps help sick people kill themselves
 
06:35:26.310 --> 06:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
with poison act thank you have a
 
06:35:28.030 --> 06:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
question sir would you answer a question
 
06:35:30.070 --> 06:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
sure representative Perez thank you
 
06:35:31.948 --> 06:35:31.958 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question are you
 
06:35:35.110 --> 06:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
will since you examined this bill so
 
06:35:37.110 --> 06:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
completely are you well aware that there
 
06:35:39.788 --> 06:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
is a page and a half
 
06:35:43.350 --> 06:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the physician from any
 
06:35:46.750 --> 06:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
consequences for doing this yes I saw
 
06:35:49.388 --> 06:35:49.398 align:start position:0%
that there that neither participation in
 
06:35:52.270 --> 06:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
or refusal to participate in would
 
06:35:54.670 --> 06:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
result in any consequences on the other
 
06:35:57.150 --> 06:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
hand coercion as people have pointed out
 
06:36:00.030 --> 06:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
which can be sometimes very subtle right
 
06:36:02.670 --> 06:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
could carry penalties coercing coercing
 
06:36:07.310 --> 06:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
a person to commit suicide or trying to
 
06:36:09.910 --> 06:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
discourage by coercion a person from
 
06:36:11.910 --> 06:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
doing this could be considered a felony
 
06:36:13.910 --> 06:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
so yes thank
 
06:36:23.548 --> 06:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:26.270 --> 06:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
lvery my seventh in in
 
06:36:29.310 --> 06:36:29.320 align:start position:0%
stretch I'm Gordon ly from King and I
 
06:36:32.030 --> 06:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I'm here to tell

my wife's end of life story
 
06:36:36.750 --> 06:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
Marcy's six-year battle with cancer was
 
06:36:40.030 --> 06:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
over she was in hospice no more
 
06:36:42.030 --> 06:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
terrifying life-prolonging
 
06:36:44.468 --> 06:36:44.478 align:start position:0%
interventions Marcy had endured so much
 
06:36:49.270 --> 06:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
to live to be a friend to so many died
 
06:36:50.788 --> 06:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
at age
 
06:36:54.788 --> 06:36:54.798 align:start position:0%

DieHard cats
 
06:37:07.030 --> 06:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
let me share instead the anguish and
 
06:37:08.788 --> 06:37:08.798 align:start position:0%
frustration we endured in trying to
 
06:37:11.310 --> 06:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
realize that dream and how we failed
 
06:37:13.910 --> 06:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
largely because New Hampshire did not
 
06:37:18.468 --> 06:37:18.478 align:start position:0%
have a law like HB 254 in the year
 
06:37:21.190 --> 06:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
2020 Marcy and I researched end of life
 
06:37:23.350 --> 06:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
options we could let nature take its
 
06:37:25.948 --> 06:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
course with help from hospice Marcy
 
06:37:28.150 --> 06:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
might gradually decline into a medicated
 
06:37:31.628 --> 06:37:31.638 align:start position:0%
coma or she might die suddenly and
 
06:37:34.548 --> 06:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
painfully gasping for breath with family
 
06:37:37.510 --> 06:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
as terrified and helpless bystandard we
 
06:37:38.750 --> 06:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
had been
 
06:37:41.990 --> 06:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
there Vermont had a six-month residency
 
06:37:45.230 --> 06:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
requirement in 2020 a deal breaker we
 
06:37:47.310 --> 06:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
learned about dignitas an organization
 
06:37:49.030 --> 06:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
in Switzerland that provides medical
 
06:37:52.708 --> 06:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
assistance and dying we found the
 
06:37:55.270 --> 06:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
$10,000 needed and spent months
 
06:37:58.110 --> 06:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
Gathering documents the best of our bad
 
06:38:00.430 --> 06:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
options we were ready to fly when
 
06:38:02.750 --> 06:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
Switzerland closed its border due to the
 
06:38:04.388 --> 06:38:04.398 align:start position:0%
covid Pand
 
06:38:07.190 --> 06:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
mic but a person determined to hasten
 
06:38:08.788 --> 06:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
the end of life and I want to emphasize
 
06:38:10.670 --> 06:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
hasten this is a person who's going to
 
06:38:12.830 --> 06:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
die it's just a matter of
 
06:38:15.270 --> 06:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
when person who chooses to hasten their
 
06:38:17.350 --> 06:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
end of life in their final days has many
 
06:38:20.468 --> 06:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
options an overdose of meds for example
 
06:38:22.788 --> 06:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
but this is suicide now and anyone
 
06:38:25.030 --> 06:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
assisting can face criminal charges
 
06:38:27.548 --> 06:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
social stigma and risk of failure
 
06:38:27.558 --> 06:38:28.468 align:start position:0%
social stigma and risk of failure
sometimes

06:38:28.468 --> 06:38:28.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
06:38:30.910 --> 06:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and sometimes while plans
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
are being made death just comes on
 
06:38:37.548 --> 06:38:37.558 align:start position:0%
bidden at age 880 I am in great health
 
06:38:39.830 --> 06:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
but when my end nears I plan to die in
 
06:38:42.868 --> 06:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
the same bed my wife died in at a time I
 
06:38:45.510 --> 06:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
feel is right in the freedom of privacy
 
06:38:47.430 --> 06:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
of my home and there's really nothing
 
06:38:50.310 --> 06:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire can do about
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
that isn't it time to give the
 
06:38:54.670 --> 06:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
terminally ill and their families a
 
06:38:56.788 --> 06:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
better option than leaving the state or
 
06:38:58.510 --> 06:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
the country to Access Medical Aid and
 
06:39:00.750 --> 06:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
dying free them from the risks and
 
06:39:03.830 --> 06:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
stigma of suicide give them the comfort
 
06:39:06.430 --> 06:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
of a legal option in New Hampshire even
 
06:39:09.150 --> 06:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
if we never use it help more of us
 
06:39:11.070 --> 06:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
realize that end of life dream we all
 
06:39:15.388 --> 06:39:15.398 align:start position:0%
share vote in favor Marcy would
 
06:39:17.510 --> 06:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
approve thank
 
06:39:27.628 --> 06:39:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:29.948 --> 06:39:29.958 align:start position:0%
Wade uh members of the committee uh my
 
06:39:31.670 --> 06:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
name is Steve Wade I'm the executive
 
06:39:33.670 --> 06:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
director of The Brain Injury Association
 
06:39:35.868 --> 06:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and also a member of
 
06:39:38.030 --> 06:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition of Suicide
 
06:39:39.388 --> 06:39:39.398 align:start position:0%
Prevention which is a coalition of
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
disability organizations opposed to
 
06:39:42.830 --> 06:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
physician assisted
 
06:39:45.750 --> 06:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
suicide I'm here to speak in opposition
 
06:39:47.868 --> 06:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
of Medical Aid and dying by physician
 
06:39:49.830 --> 06:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide of course they go
 
06:39:51.510 --> 06:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
together it's medical and dying by
 
06:39:54.150 --> 06:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
physician assisted suicide um I just
 
06:39:55.910 --> 06:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to share as to I know a lot has
 
06:39:57.628 --> 06:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned today but I wanted to
 
06:39:59.750 --> 06:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
share about why does the disability why
 
06:40:01.548 --> 06:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
is the disability community so concerned
 
06:40:03.510 --> 06:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
about this issue and I think one one of
 
06:40:06.110 --> 06:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
the key reasons is many people with
 
06:40:08.628 --> 06:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
disability are on Medicaid they don't
 
06:40:10.590 --> 06:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
have access generally to the best health
 
06:40:12.750 --> 06:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
care or best supports and people on
 
06:40:14.388 --> 06:40:14.398 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and most people with disability
 
06:40:15.948 --> 06:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
particularly people with brain injury do
 
06:40:18.388 --> 06:40:18.398 align:start position:0%
not have access to good quality
 
06:40:21.388 --> 06:40:21.398 align:start position:0%
paliative care and that is critical and
 
06:40:22.990 --> 06:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's something we've been working
 
06:40:24.628 --> 06:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
on for for many years trying to really
 
06:40:26.190 --> 06:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
strengthen paliative care for people
 
06:40:26.200 --> 06:40:27.150 align:start position:0%
strengthen paliative care for people
with

06:40:27.150 --> 06:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities you know we fear though if
 
06:40:31.310 --> 06:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
this bill passes there'll be no
 
06:40:33.948 --> 06:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
incentive to strengthen p of care for
 
06:40:35.590 --> 06:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable for folks on
 
06:40:37.270 --> 06:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and I think that's borne out by
 
06:40:38.830 --> 06:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
the other states that have passed uh
 
06:40:41.868 --> 06:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
legislation such as this the other point
 
06:40:44.670 --> 06:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
was um we talk about uh the majority I
 
06:40:45.830 --> 06:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
think it was mentioned the majority
 
06:40:47.948 --> 06:40:47.958 align:start position:0%
support this law well we're not a
 
06:40:51.030 --> 06:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
majoritarian democracy we the minority
 
06:40:53.708 --> 06:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
matters I I remember a quote by Senator
 
06:40:56.110 --> 06:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
Hubert Humphrey who said that the
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
measure of a democracy is how it treats
 
06:41:00.350 --> 06:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
the minority how it treats people who
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
are vulnerable who are at risk so again
 
06:41:05.310 --> 06:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
please it's the the people that are
 
06:41:07.150 --> 06:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
underserved those are the folks we need
 
06:41:09.788 --> 06:41:09.798 align:start position:0%
to really worry about I also wanted to
 
06:41:10.948 --> 06:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
talk about veterans living with
 
06:41:12.750 --> 06:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury uh and and
 
06:41:15.310 --> 06:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
oftentimes co-occurring PTSD I've spent
 
06:41:16.788 --> 06:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
30 years as executive director of The
 
06:41:18.510 --> 06:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
Brain Injury Association we saw some
 
06:41:19.830 --> 06:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
really terrible things coming out of the
 
06:41:22.150 --> 06:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
war on terror many veterans in the state
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
with traumatic brain injury and
 
06:41:26.388 --> 06:41:26.398 align:start position:0%
extremely high risk for suicide I think
 
06:41:28.788 --> 06:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
the highest of all veteran populations
 
06:41:30.150 --> 06:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
so our team at the Brain Injury
 
06:41:31.948 --> 06:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
Association has spent the last 5 years
 
06:41:33.788 --> 06:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
really trying to build a strong
 
06:41:36.350 --> 06:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
culture of we call help seeking trying
 
06:41:37.868 --> 06:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
to encourage veterans and their family
 
06:41:39.310 --> 06:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
caregivers to seek help within the
 
06:41:40.750 --> 06:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
community certainly within the brain
 
06:41:44.190 --> 06:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
injury Community unfortunately I think a
 
06:41:45.990 --> 06:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill like this goes in the opposite
 
06:41:48.150 --> 06:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
direction it really focuses not on
 
06:41:49.830 --> 06:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
help-seeking but the opposite of help
 
06:41:53.190 --> 06:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
seeking maybe seeking a death perhaps
 
06:41:54.948 --> 06:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
you know I it's just it just goes
 
06:41:56.670 --> 06:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
against a lot of hard work over many
 
06:41:58.430 --> 06:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
many years by many folks who have been
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
veterans I also want to suggest that
 
06:42:07.590 --> 06:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
sending that passing this bill does send
 
06:42:09.708 --> 06:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
a the wrong message certainly as the
 
06:42:12.030 --> 06:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee you well aware that
 
06:42:15.030 --> 06:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
the law teaches the law says what we
 
06:42:17.910 --> 06:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
value as a culture as a society and I
 
06:42:21.430 --> 06:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
think again when something like this a
 
06:42:23.590 --> 06:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill like this passes it's it's sending
 
06:42:25.510 --> 06:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
a message it's saying this is what we
 
06:42:27.190 --> 06:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
value this is what the law values this
 
06:42:29.230 --> 06:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
is what we as a legislature
 
06:42:31.708 --> 06:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
value we've also heard that this isn't
 
06:42:34.270 --> 06:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
suicide well we that's your time if you
 
06:42:36.150 --> 06:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
could wrap okay thanks let me just wrap
 
06:42:38.788 --> 06:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
up there quickly so um anyway the
 
06:42:41.868 --> 06:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
foundational medical ethic Do no harm I
 
06:42:43.788 --> 06:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
think is in great danger if this bill
 
06:42:45.910 --> 06:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
passes so thank you very
 
06:43:28.670 --> 06:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee my
 
06:43:34.150 --> 06:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
name is Lee May
 
06:43:36.868 --> 06:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
and I am a resident of the Kendall
 
06:43:39.548 --> 06:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
retirement community in
 
06:43:43.788 --> 06:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
Handover a close friend of my wife Linda
 
06:43:46.750 --> 06:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
and me had a husband with terminal brain
 
06:43:49.070 --> 06:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
cancer when he received the pro
 
06:43:51.350 --> 06:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
prognosis of having six months or less
 
06:43:53.948 --> 06:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
to live he was able to use Vermont's
 
06:43:57.070 --> 06:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid in dying procedures by doing
 
06:44:00.548 --> 06:44:00.558 align:start position:0%
so he saved himself months of suffering
 
06:44:03.670 --> 06:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
his last words were on to my Great
 
06:44:06.948 --> 06:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
Adventure next great adventure his wife
 
06:44:10.430 --> 06:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
our friend was comforted by how Serene
 
06:44:13.708 --> 06:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
and peaceful his death was several years
 
06:44:16.110 --> 06:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
later our widowed friend was now living
 
06:44:18.910 --> 06:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
at Kendall she had developed a rare form
 
06:44:22.270 --> 06:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
of anemia called MDS syndrome it left
 
06:44:24.468 --> 06:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
her utterly exhausted and it was
 
06:44:27.510 --> 06:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
developing into leukemia last year her
 
06:44:29.190 --> 06:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
doctors informed her that she had six
 
06:44:31.990 --> 06:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
months or less to live unless she
 
06:44:34.230 --> 06:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
received increasing ly frequent
 
06:44:36.670 --> 06:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
transfusions even with that treatment
 
06:44:39.270 --> 06:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
she would become weaker and weaker and
 
06:44:42.070 --> 06:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
would soon be unable to live
 
06:44:44.388 --> 06:44:44.398 align:start position:0%
independently remembering how peaceful
 
06:44:46.990 --> 06:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
her husband's death had been she decided
 
06:44:51.628 --> 06:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
to use Vermont's Medical Aid in dying
 
06:44:54.070 --> 06:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
procedure but think about it to use
 
06:44:56.670 --> 06:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid in dying an 85-year-old
 
06:44:59.708 --> 06:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
terminally ill Widow with no family left
 
06:45:02.230 --> 06:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
had to make repeated trips to Vermont to
 
06:45:04.830 --> 06:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
fulfill all the requirements necessary
 
06:45:07.948 --> 06:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
to ending her life as she
 
06:45:11.150 --> 06:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
wished this past December she invited
 
06:45:13.788 --> 06:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
friends including Linda and me and her
 
06:45:16.310 --> 06:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
doctor to the Vermont home made
 
06:45:19.070 --> 06:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
available by two of the Vermont friends
 
06:45:21.868 --> 06:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
to be with her as she died we spent the
 
06:45:24.030 --> 06:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
morning talking and laughing as we
 
06:45:26.548 --> 06:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
celebrated her life then she drank the
 
06:45:28.830 --> 06:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
strong medication that she had been
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
prescribed as she became drowsy she said
 
06:45:35.110 --> 06:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
I want you to take in how un agonizing
 
06:45:38.750 --> 06:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is take that out as a message about
 
06:45:41.270 --> 06:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
the value of the gift of Medical Aid and
 
06:45:44.670 --> 06:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
dying I also for one heard her say as
 
06:45:46.788 --> 06:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
she was close to falling asleep for the
 
06:45:50.830 --> 06:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:53.708 --> 06:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
wow thank you for granting me this
 
06:45:55.548 --> 06:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
06:45:57.230 --> 06:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
speak thank
 
06:46:11.510 --> 06:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:13.948 --> 06:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Sue Allen I'm
 
06:46:15.708 --> 06:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
a resident of
 
06:46:19.310 --> 06:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hollis I'm asking you to oppose this
 
06:46:23.468 --> 06:46:23.478 align:start position:0%
bill we have heard admonishments for you
 
06:46:26.628 --> 06:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
to ignore the projections and
 
06:46:30.110 --> 06:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
predictions as to the results and
 
06:46:34.430 --> 06:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
effects of uh uh Medical Aid and dying
 
06:46:37.388 --> 06:46:37.398 align:start position:0%
we heard this um earlier this afternoon
 
06:46:41.468 --> 06:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
but I I uh I I wonder why would we
 
06:46:46.270 --> 06:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
blindfold ourselves to um how the uh
 
06:46:49.788 --> 06:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
suicide laws have have played out
 
06:46:53.708 --> 06:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
elsewhere many points have been made
 
06:46:58.750 --> 06:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
here um but really what I see as a core
 
06:47:00.230 --> 06:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
of this
 
06:47:03.030 --> 06:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
06:47:06.868 --> 06:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
your determinations are going to uh
 
06:47:10.750 --> 06:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
assign by law who is authorized to
 
06:47:10.760 --> 06:47:12.468 align:start position:0%
assign by law who is authorized to
administer

06:47:12.468 --> 06:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
administer
 
06:47:14.910 --> 06:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
death I believe that's the core of the
 
06:47:18.388 --> 06:47:18.398 align:start position:0%
question um the interesting part here
 
06:47:22.830 --> 06:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
now is um the testimony of my oldest
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
Aunt who joined the Red Cross
 
06:47:28.708 --> 06:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
immediately at the end of World War II
 
06:47:30.230 --> 06:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
she was sent to
 
06:47:33.708 --> 06:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
Germany I grew up with her repeated
 
06:47:36.910 --> 06:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
testimony so that none of us would ever
 
06:47:42.070 --> 06:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
forget it that uh in 1946 the German
 
06:47:45.110 --> 06:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses told the Americans
 
06:47:48.510 --> 06:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
how the old people's institutions were
 
06:47:52.110 --> 06:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
emptied and the handicapped institutions
 
06:47:55.230 --> 06:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
were emptied so yes I want to emphasize
 
06:47:59.310 --> 06:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
the slippery slope there are other
 
06:48:00.788 --> 06:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
examples have already been testified
 
06:48:03.510 --> 06:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
here today about how the 10,000 suicides
 
06:48:07.990 --> 06:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
in um uh or use of this in Canada has in
 
06:48:09.628 --> 06:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
a very short amount of time gone to
 
06:48:11.990 --> 06:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
13,000 anyway there there are all these
 
06:48:15.230 --> 06:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
other examples that I think we need to
 
06:48:20.628 --> 06:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
consider and um the one example that I
 
06:48:23.708 --> 06:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
want you seriously to consider is organ
 
06:48:26.270 --> 06:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
harvesting isn't isn't that the next
 
06:48:29.910 --> 06:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about appending a uh
 
06:48:34.070 --> 06:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion that anyone who is sign on
 
06:48:35.868 --> 06:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
freely and willingly to Medical Aid and
 
06:48:39.030 --> 06:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
dying would please also agree to or
 
06:48:42.230 --> 06:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
harvesting but the actual issue with
 
06:48:44.548 --> 06:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
that when you read about it and I got
 
06:48:46.788 --> 06:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
this from the um population Research
 
06:48:49.150 --> 06:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
Institute because the Chinese are doing
 
06:48:51.270 --> 06:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
it to the yugar if that's how you
 
06:48:54.350 --> 06:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
pronounce their name um it actually the
 
06:48:57.030 --> 06:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
best organ harvesting is right before
 
06:48:59.468 --> 06:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
the moment of death so I leave you with
 
06:49:02.468 --> 06:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
that that um please oppose this bill for
 
06:49:05.190 --> 06:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
the reason that we don't consider death
 
06:49:07.150 --> 06:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
treatment we don't want death to become
 
06:49:10.468 --> 06:49:10.478 align:start position:0%
a duty uh we need Suicide Prevention not
 
06:49:13.190 --> 06:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
suicide promotion so I ask you to oppose
 
06:49:16.350 --> 06:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
06:49:19.948 --> 06:49:19.958 align:start position:0%

Andrew and uh I just want to tell uh my
 
06:49:54.110 --> 06:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
story just last week I attended a
 
06:49:56.990 --> 06:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
funeral at St an's Church in Berlin for
 
06:49:59.190 --> 06:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
the mother of my best friend in high
 
06:50:02.270 --> 06:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
school and his mom had moved from Berlin
 
06:50:04.310 --> 06:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
to to live with his
 
06:50:06.708 --> 06:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
sister at the reception after the
 
06:50:08.548 --> 06:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
funeral he told me his mom was diagnosed
 
06:50:10.510 --> 06:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
as being terminal and only had a few
 
06:50:13.070 --> 06:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
weeks to live she chose to go back to
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
her daughter's house where medical
 
06:50:18.190 --> 06:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
assistance and dying is
 
06:50:20.708 --> 06:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
permitted so he went up to be with her
 
06:50:22.430 --> 06:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
and during her last few moments when her
 
06:50:24.948 --> 06:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
breathing was difficult and the end was
 
06:50:27.670 --> 06:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
obiously near my friend a retired
 
06:50:30.190 --> 06:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
physician sat on the edge of the bed
 
06:50:32.430 --> 06:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
picked up his mother and hugged her as
 
06:50:35.110 --> 06:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
she she died in his arm and he says was
 
06:50:37.708 --> 06:50:37.718 align:start position:0%
very loving and very powerful
 
06:50:40.430 --> 06:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
movement and I want to contrast that to
 
06:50:43.430 --> 06:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
my father my 90-year-old father after
 
06:50:45.910 --> 06:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
years long battle he was diagnosed as
 
06:50:48.030 --> 06:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
terminal and while in the hospital he
 
06:50:50.468 --> 06:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
was able to finally convince the
 
06:50:54.110 --> 06:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians for pallative care he had to
 
06:50:55.910 --> 06:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
be transferred from the hospital to the
 
06:50:58.788 --> 06:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
hospice house by ambulance which caused
 
06:51:01.430 --> 06:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
him great discomfort once at hospice
 
06:51:03.788 --> 06:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
house I gave him excellent care he was
 
06:51:06.230 --> 06:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
medicated he was snowed he didn't seem
 
06:51:08.830 --> 06:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
like he had any pain he was
 
06:51:11.270 --> 06:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
nonresponsive but he lasted two weeks I
 
06:51:14.388 --> 06:51:14.398 align:start position:0%
saw his body just shrivel up and I was
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
spending 18-hour days at hospice house
 
06:51:19.030 --> 06:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
with him but I went home to shower and
 
06:51:21.150 --> 06:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
to change my clothes and I received the
 
06:51:24.430 --> 06:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
call that he had died I was not with him
 
06:51:25.788 --> 06:51:25.798 align:start position:0%

06:51:28.110 --> 06:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
alone and I
 
06:51:31.990 --> 06:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
know because he kept telling me if I
 
06:51:33.190 --> 06:51:33.200 align:start position:0%

outside the window as she

06:53:02.150 --> 06:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
God was in that room for some people
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
people of Faith they don't look forward
 
06:53:06.708 --> 06:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
to death but they don't fear it either
 
06:53:09.190 --> 06:53:09.200 align:start position:0%

meetings I'm here today because I want
 
06:54:50.270 --> 06:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
to bring the story of a New Hampshire
 
06:54:53.670 --> 06:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
resident who is coming to Vermont for
 
06:54:55.788 --> 06:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying his name is Barry
 
06:54:59.548 --> 06:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
daer this is uh uh these are words that
 
06:55:03.310 --> 06:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
he authorized me to share with you
 
06:55:05.350 --> 06:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
um he says when I got my cancer
 
06:55:07.230 --> 06:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis the first thing that came to
 
06:55:09.830 --> 06:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
mind was Medical Aid and dying in
 
06:55:12.270 --> 06:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont because I know how difficult
 
06:55:14.750 --> 06:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
this end stage for this aggressive lung
 
06:55:17.510 --> 06:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
cancer will be this really hit me my dad
 
06:55:19.548 --> 06:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
died of lung cancer too and he used
 
06:55:21.270 --> 06:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid in
 
06:55:24.110 --> 06:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
dying um he knows how difficult it will
 
06:55:26.510 --> 06:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
be I really don't want to put myself
 
06:55:29.190 --> 06:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
through that I don't want to die but
 
06:55:31.310 --> 06:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's the reality I have a terminal
 
06:55:31.320 --> 06:55:33.628 align:start position:0%
that's the reality I have a terminal
illness

06:55:33.628 --> 06:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
illness
 
06:55:36.070 --> 06:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
and so we had a long conversation about
 
06:55:39.590 --> 06:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
his plans he became a um a patient of a
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
doctor in southern Vermont has made
 
06:55:44.788 --> 06:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
several visits already I asked him if
 
06:55:46.350 --> 06:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
there were some words that he would like
 
06:55:48.628 --> 06:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
to convey to the legislature here in in
 
06:55:48.638 --> 06:55:49.388 align:start position:0%
to convey to the legislature here in in
New

06:55:49.388 --> 06:55:49.398 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:55:53.190 --> 06:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he says quote it's not an
 
06:55:55.430 --> 06:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
easy Journey for anybody who is dying to
 
06:55:58.270 --> 06:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
travel to another state for people who
 
06:56:00.350 --> 06:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
want Medical Aid and dying to not have
 
06:56:02.590 --> 06:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
that ability in my home state is a
 
06:56:02.600 --> 06:56:04.070 align:start position:0%
that ability in my home state is a
severe

06:56:04.070 --> 06:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
severe
 
06:56:06.388 --> 06:56:06.398 align:start position:0%
hardship I've seen in the polls that the
 
06:56:08.708 --> 06:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
vast majority of New Hampshire people
 
06:56:11.708 --> 06:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
want this option so people don't have to
 
06:56:14.510 --> 06:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
go through a very cumbersome process and
 
06:56:17.468 --> 06:56:17.478 align:start position:0%
go to another state in order to make the
 
06:56:20.190 --> 06:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
choice they want to
 
06:56:23.788 --> 06:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
make he also said I want to say to the
 
06:56:27.590 --> 06:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
people in Vermont thank you so very
 
06:56:30.830 --> 06:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
much for making this option to determine
 
06:56:34.388 --> 06:56:34.398 align:start position:0%
the end of my life in the way I choose
 
06:56:38.310 --> 06:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
possible so honestly with the number of
 
06:56:40.590 --> 06:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
people who have been contacting Us in
 
06:56:43.548 --> 06:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
Vermont since we lifted The Residency
 
06:56:45.548 --> 06:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
requirement I think it's time for people
 
06:56:47.230 --> 06:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
in other states including New Hampshire
 
06:56:50.310 --> 06:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
to step up and to listen to these
 
06:56:53.230 --> 06:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
constituents I can tell you that um
 
06:56:54.990 --> 06:56:55.000 align:start position:0%

2023 um more than 1300 people from New
 
06:57:02.190 --> 06:57:02.200 align:start position:0%

Vermont and what do you charge for that
 
06:57:46.590 --> 06:57:46.600 align:start position:0%

have actually gone the only data we have
 
06:57:57.430 --> 06:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
so far is that from the Department of
 
06:58:00.788 --> 06:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
Health for the year end of June
 
06:58:04.110 --> 06:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
2024 there were 24 people from out of
 
06:58:06.350 --> 06:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
state and that covers new there were
 
06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
people from new um I don't think there
 
06:58:10.510 --> 06:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
were any New Hampshire people in that in
 
06:58:13.230 --> 06:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
that um in that group yet that was the
 
06:58:18.070 --> 06:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
first um 12-month period um 24 people

06:58:27.990 --> 06:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
growing any other
 
06:58:34.310 --> 06:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:34.320 --> 06:58:41.670 align:start position:0%

today we want to make sure everybody's
 
06:58:49.958 --> 06:58:58.388 align:start position:0%
today we want to make sure everybody's
heard

06:58:58.388 --> 06:58:58.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:00.948 --> 06:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
though hello members of the committee my
 
06:59:02.548 --> 06:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
name is Jules good
 
06:59:04.788 --> 06:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
I am a non-religious gay multiply
 
06:59:07.150 --> 06:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
disabled person and I also happen to be
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
a national Disability Policy
 
06:59:10.628 --> 06:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
professional from New Market I'm
 
06:59:13.110 --> 06:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to HP
 
06:59:16.350 --> 06:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
254 I know we've been here for a while
 
06:59:18.030 --> 06:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
so if you take one thing for my
 
06:59:20.708 --> 06:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
testimony please let it be this the
 
06:59:23.150 --> 06:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
disabled people who oppose this bill do
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
so not because we don't understand the
 
06:59:27.548 --> 06:59:27.558 align:start position:0%
bill not because we're controlled by
 
06:59:30.350 --> 06:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
fear but because we know many
 
06:59:33.388 --> 06:59:33.398 align:start position:0%
disabilities and illnesses can become
 
06:59:36.350 --> 06:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
terminal if not treated properly and
 
06:59:38.708 --> 06:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
land Us in the eligible category for
 
06:59:41.350 --> 06:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide to say it has nothing
 
06:59:43.750 --> 06:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
to do with disability is demonstrably
 
06:59:46.310 --> 06:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
false I had lime disease which is an
 
06:59:48.990 --> 06:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
easily treatable infection but because I
 
06:59:51.030 --> 06:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't access treatment it progressed
 
06:59:53.230 --> 06:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
to the point where my life was in danger
 
06:59:55.830 --> 06:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
and it left me permanently disabled
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between being
 
07:00:00.510 --> 07:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
a well-insured person having the privil
 
07:00:02.590 --> 07:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
privilege of exhausting every available
 
07:00:04.350 --> 07:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
treatment option before expressing a
 
07:00:06.750 --> 07:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
desire to die and someone without that
 
07:00:09.230 --> 07:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
privilege being repeatedly denied care
 
07:00:11.670 --> 07:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
until death is their only option New
 
07:00:13.548 --> 07:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is consistently ranked the
 
07:00:15.270 --> 07:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
lowest among New England states in
 
07:00:17.548 --> 07:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
providing long-term services and support
 
07:00:20.150 --> 07:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
to older adults and disabled people when
 
07:00:21.708 --> 07:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
people are forced to choose between
 
07:00:23.310 --> 07:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
suffering and death because they can't
 
07:00:25.670 --> 07:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
afford or access care they are not
 
07:00:28.468 --> 07:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
getting a real choice this bill makes
 
07:00:29.990 --> 07:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
systemically steering these people
 
07:00:32.350 --> 07:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
toward death a protected Act even if
 
07:00:34.910 --> 07:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's not its intent if you think those
 
07:00:38.910 --> 07:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
deaths in any number are acceptable
 
07:00:40.150 --> 07:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
because they're happening to people you
 
07:00:42.310 --> 07:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
don't know or don't like or don't care
 
07:00:45.030 --> 07:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
about you should reflect on that we do
 
07:00:47.388 --> 07:00:47.398 align:start position:0%
not need to endanger vulnerable people
 
07:00:49.190 --> 07:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
to get to a place where people who are
 
07:00:51.830 --> 07:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
truly terminally ill can get appropriate
 
07:00:53.868 --> 07:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
pain management at the end of life and
 
07:00:56.030 --> 07:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
die in the setting of their choice we
 
07:00:57.510 --> 07:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
can invest in training for medical
 
07:00:59.468 --> 07:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
professionals to close knowledge gaps in
 
07:01:01.910 --> 07:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
pain management and pation we can educ
 
07:01:03.788 --> 07:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
educate providers and patients on
 
07:01:05.310 --> 07:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
options for making their lives more
 
07:01:07.468 --> 07:01:07.478 align:start position:0%

regular basis to live full and beautiful
 
07:01:19.350 --> 07:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
lives it is unconscionable to pass a
 
07:01:21.830 --> 07:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
policy that makes the true free choice
 
07:01:24.190 --> 07:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
on whether to live or die a privilege
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
reserved for those with access to high
 
07:01:27.910 --> 07:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
quality Health Care thank you and I'm

questions any questions seeing none
thankk

07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
thankk
 
07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:41.948 --> 07:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
Zuckerman thank you very much for giving
 
07:01:45.110 --> 07:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
me the opportunity to speak and I um
 
07:01:46.708 --> 07:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
just want to say I really respect the
 
07:01:48.388 --> 07:01:48.398 align:start position:0%
difficult choices in front of you as a
 
07:01:50.468 --> 07:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
18-year policy maker in Vermont before I
 
07:01:52.868 --> 07:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
became lieutenant governor for six years
 
07:01:55.230 --> 07:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
I'm well aware of many of the topics
 
07:01:57.270 --> 07:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
that you have to face and deliberate on
 
07:01:59.628 --> 07:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
and thank you for listening to all of us
 
07:02:01.948 --> 07:02:01.958 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to speak to this from a few
 
07:02:03.548 --> 07:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
different perspectives one is my dad was
 
07:02:06.750 --> 07:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
a doctor two is he died when I was 13
 
07:02:08.750 --> 07:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
years old I remember visiting the
 
07:02:10.990 --> 07:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
hospital with him in the years that I
 
07:02:13.230 --> 07:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
can remember and the care that he took
 
07:02:16.190 --> 07:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
with his patients as a a cardiothoracic
 
07:02:19.150 --> 07:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
surgeon and the topic has come up of Do
 
07:02:22.110 --> 07:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
no harm and the hypocritic oath my dad
 
07:02:24.350 --> 07:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
would talk to patients who were maybe in
 
07:02:26.628 --> 07:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
their late 70s who had what would now be
 
07:02:29.510 --> 07:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
called stage four cancer lung cancer and
 
07:02:33.030 --> 07:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
he would talk with them about surgery
 
07:02:34.910 --> 07:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
and cracking their chest and not
 
07:02:39.110 --> 07:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
recovery at that age versus managing
 
07:02:41.030 --> 07:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
their pain or their
 
07:02:43.590 --> 07:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
symptoms and they could make that
 
07:02:48.110 --> 07:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
choice harm is really the definition of
 
07:02:49.990 --> 07:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the conversation between the doctor and
 
07:02:53.030 --> 07:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
the patient and the patient having that
 
07:02:56.628 --> 07:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
ability to contemplate the
 
07:02:59.990 --> 07:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
options in this situation the option is
 
07:03:03.270 --> 07:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
not whether to die or not to die
 
07:03:05.830 --> 07:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
the the question is at what point and
 
07:03:07.468 --> 07:03:07.478 align:start position:0%
under what conditions and under what
 
07:03:10.350 --> 07:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
under what independent autonomy that
 
07:03:12.990 --> 07:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
that individual so chooses and I think
 
07:03:14.110 --> 07:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's really important because we've
 
07:03:16.070 --> 07:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
heard about that a little bit about Do
 
07:03:19.030 --> 07:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
no harm that individual is the one that
 
07:03:20.990 --> 07:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
really ought to have that choice in that
 
07:03:22.708 --> 07:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
conversation with their
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
doctor I also want to add that in
 
07:03:26.670 --> 07:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont there was a lot of these similar
 
07:03:28.468 --> 07:03:28.478 align:start position:0%
concerns brought up and I think they're
 
07:03:31.388 --> 07:03:31.398 align:start position:0%
very um valid they're legitimate their
 
07:03:34.830 --> 07:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
opinion their concerns but in Vermont
 
07:03:36.270 --> 07:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
all of these were
 
07:03:38.910 --> 07:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
raised and they have not come to pass
 
07:03:40.948 --> 07:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
because of the provisions in the law
 
07:03:42.548 --> 07:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
just as your bill
 
07:03:45.030 --> 07:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
has you are not
 
07:03:48.430 --> 07:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
Canada you are New Hampshire you get to
 
07:03:49.948 --> 07:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
control the wording of your law and
 
07:03:51.590 --> 07:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
whether it changes in the
 
07:03:54.270 --> 07:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
future you can imagine to open it up
 
07:03:57.030 --> 07:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
more is a huge task just as the way to
 
07:04:00.070 --> 07:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
even pass the law would be so if people
 
07:04:02.510 --> 07:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the law going down a
 
07:04:05.030 --> 07:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
slippery slope I could just let you know
 
07:04:07.708 --> 07:04:07.718 align:start position:0%
it has not done that in Vermont nor
 
07:04:09.788 --> 07:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
other states in this country where
 
07:04:12.468 --> 07:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
people are making sure folks are
 
07:04:14.910 --> 07:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
protected I also want to add as a
 
07:04:16.830 --> 07:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
lawmaker and to folks who are
 
07:04:19.708 --> 07:04:19.718 align:start position:0%
constituents across the state the ways
 
07:04:19.718 --> 07:04:20.548 align:start position:0%
constituents across the state the ways
to

07:04:20.548 --> 07:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:04:24.628 --> 07:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
address suicide for young people is to
 
07:04:26.548 --> 07:04:26.558 align:start position:0%
fund counselors in
 
07:04:29.868 --> 07:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
schools the way to address concerns
 
07:04:33.270 --> 07:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
about um being a bir on one's family is
 
07:04:35.670 --> 07:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure if you have a disability
 
07:04:36.590 --> 07:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
07:04:39.750 --> 07:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
fund the services that help families and
 
07:04:42.030 --> 07:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
help those individuals live the best
 
07:04:44.468 --> 07:04:44.478 align:start position:0%
life they can so that there isn't that
 
07:04:46.948 --> 07:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
pressure burden you can wrap it up thank
 
07:04:50.430 --> 07:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
you um I'll just add that I've been
 
07:04:53.030 --> 07:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
approached by many people in grocery
 
07:04:54.788 --> 07:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
stores and other places who have come up
 
07:04:57.830 --> 07:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
to me to say thank you that their loved
 
07:05:02.150 --> 07:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
one died in the most loving and peaceful
 
07:05:03.708 --> 07:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
way and that's not to say that other
 
07:05:05.590 --> 07:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
people don't also have such
 
07:05:07.948 --> 07:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances but they were all there
 
07:05:09.590 --> 07:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I have two documents cuz someone
 
07:05:10.910 --> 07:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
else forgot to hand in there so I'm
 
07:05:13.230 --> 07:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
going to give you I am open to questions
 
07:05:16.110 --> 07:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
as well are there any questions at all
 
07:05:19.788 --> 07:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:24.708 --> 07:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:28.990 --> 07:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:31.830 --> 07:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
here hi my name is Laura Allison I
 
07:05:34.590 --> 07:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
believe Laura elazim took my spot a
 
07:05:34.600 --> 07:05:35.628 align:start position:0%
believe Laura elazim took my spot a
while

07:05:35.628 --> 07:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
while
 
07:05:39.948 --> 07:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
ago um but that's okay um so I was going
 
07:05:42.670 --> 07:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
to address the slippery slope today and
 
07:05:45.030 --> 07:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
I realized after listening to everyone
 
07:05:47.270 --> 07:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
that I've been on the slippery slope for
 
07:05:50.030 --> 07:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
the last three months my mother had a
 
07:05:53.948 --> 07:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
terminal condition she was 85 years old
 
07:05:55.750 --> 07:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's it she was quirky with a touch of
 
07:05:58.110 --> 07:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
dementia and dementia is the term for a
 
07:05:59.868 --> 07:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
collection of symptoms without a formal
 
07:06:02.708 --> 07:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of disease pathology until
 
07:06:05.030 --> 07:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
autopsy I was her designated health
 
07:06:07.388 --> 07:06:07.398 align:start position:0%
proxy and my job was to Advocate her
 
07:06:09.548 --> 07:06:09.558 align:start position:0%
wishes for her end of Life
 
07:06:13.150 --> 07:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
Care um within a week of my mother's
 
07:06:14.548 --> 07:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
admittance to the
 
07:06:19.150 --> 07:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
hospital um I was told that she was not
 
07:06:20.830 --> 07:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
going to get better her brain was not
 
07:06:23.270 --> 07:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to get any better we knew this
 
07:06:25.628 --> 07:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
this had been going on for years and she
 
07:06:26.948 --> 07:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
lived at my
 
07:06:26.958 --> 07:06:28.670 align:start position:0%
lived at my
home

07:06:28.670 --> 07:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
home
 
07:06:31.708 --> 07:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
um so I over the next couple weeks I was
 
07:06:33.750 --> 07:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
given a strong sales pitch for making
 
07:06:36.628 --> 07:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
mom comfortable that word has a special
 
07:06:39.990 --> 07:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
meaning that isn't what you think
 
07:06:40.000 --> 07:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
meaning that isn't what you think
um

07:06:41.510 --> 07:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:45.270 --> 07:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
and a hospice house had a bed available
 
07:06:47.070 --> 07:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
this was an amazing opportunity they
 
07:06:49.070 --> 07:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
told me to get this situation resolved
 
07:06:51.150 --> 07:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
before the holidays as we were quickly
 
07:06:53.388 --> 07:06:53.398 align:start position:0%
approaching Thanksgiving mom would be
 
07:06:55.830 --> 07:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
given drugs to make her very sleepy for
 
07:06:57.350 --> 07:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
a few days while her body would be
 
07:07:00.468 --> 07:07:00.478 align:start position:0%
shutting down with no food or hydration
 
07:07:02.548 --> 07:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
our family could spend quality time with
 
07:07:04.350 --> 07:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
her since she would just be peacefully
 
07:07:06.708 --> 07:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
sleeping but I want you to know she was
 
07:07:08.990 --> 07:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
eating drinking walking and talking
 
07:07:11.030 --> 07:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
still at this
 
07:07:14.150 --> 07:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
time in charge of her care I could not
 
07:07:16.388 --> 07:07:16.398 align:start position:0%
do this and she would not want this she
 
07:07:19.948 --> 07:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
did not want this um to be clear I was
 
07:07:22.310 --> 07:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
assured these drugs would not cause her
 
07:07:25.070 --> 07:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
death but according to the Pala of Team
 
07:07:27.070 --> 07:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
representative we can go right to the
 
07:07:30.230 --> 07:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
hairy Edge if we have to Meanwhile mom
 
07:07:32.430 --> 07:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
was confined drugs malnourished and
 
07:07:34.670 --> 07:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
dehydrated to manage her dementia
 
07:07:36.910 --> 07:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
symptoms and I'm hearing the question
 
07:07:38.590 --> 07:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is not talking about elderly
 
07:07:40.990 --> 07:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
or disabled but only for those of sound
 
07:07:44.110 --> 07:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
mind but failing body to have options I
 
07:07:46.230 --> 07:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
want to quote um representative margerie
 
07:07:48.628 --> 07:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
Smith a sponsor of the bill this is a
 
07:07:50.910 --> 07:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
very narrow and conservative Bill
 
07:07:52.788 --> 07:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
designed that way to give New Hampshire
 
07:07:56.468 --> 07:07:56.478 align:start position:0%
a chance to put its toe in the water
 
07:07:58.230 --> 07:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
this is what concerns me what is the
 
07:08:00.190 --> 07:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
water why put a toe in unless we're
 
07:08:02.388 --> 07:08:02.398 align:start position:0%
testing for the viability of waiting in
 
07:08:05.190 --> 07:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
ankles knees how about a swim this water
 
07:08:07.670 --> 07:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a culture of death not decision not
 
07:08:10.230 --> 07:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
Authority not dignity and not what
 
07:08:13.150 --> 07:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
people necessarily are asking
 
07:08:17.190 --> 07:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
for um I had to continually advocate for
 
07:08:20.230 --> 07:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
her I met with the hospital Committee of
 
07:08:23.310 --> 07:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
15 people and me saying this is not what
 
07:08:27.070 --> 07:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
she wants but yet we continue on the
 
07:08:29.030 --> 07:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
problem with medical assistance and
 
07:08:31.708 --> 07:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
training in this procedural standard is
 
07:08:33.590 --> 07:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
that our society views Medical
 
07:08:36.230 --> 07:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
Professional professionals as smart
 
07:08:38.628 --> 07:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
highly trained Bringers of Health they
 
07:08:40.628 --> 07:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
know no more than me so they must know
 
07:08:43.070 --> 07:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
something we don't oh this is what she
 
07:08:46.350 --> 07:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
needs okay our society's fear of pain
 
07:08:48.548 --> 07:08:48.558 align:start position:0%
and death play into a culture that says
 
07:08:49.868 --> 07:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
death is better than I'm sorry that's
 
07:08:49.878 --> 07:08:50.628 align:start position:0%
death is better than I'm sorry that's
your

07:08:50.628 --> 07:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
your
 
07:08:53.548 --> 07:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
time um let me wrap it up
 
07:08:56.830 --> 07:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
with um repeating the quote that 82% of
 
07:08:59.110 --> 07:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
doctors say life is not worth living
 
07:09:01.110 --> 07:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
with a disability my mom didn't
 
07:09:02.708 --> 07:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
understand her impairments but she
 
07:09:05.070 --> 07:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to die on her own terms I
 
07:09:07.230 --> 07:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
advocated for her until I was barred
 
07:09:09.590 --> 07:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
from doing so and even though the
 
07:09:11.510 --> 07:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
hospital objective was clear I couldn't
 
07:09:13.590 --> 07:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
fathom the depth of betrayal by those we
 
07:09:15.430 --> 07:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
entrust with our care and care of our
 
07:09:17.868 --> 07:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
loved ones we need real options for the
 
07:09:20.948 --> 07:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
dying not treatment options giving them
 
07:09:23.310 --> 07:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbox what is your
 
07:09:26.910 --> 07:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
name Laura Allison did you you turn the
 
07:09:30.150 --> 07:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
card in I did it was way back at the
 
07:09:36.070 --> 07:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:41.150 --> 07:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
Greenland name yes now I get it y Alexon

favor of House Bill
 
07:10:23.910 --> 07:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
254 I would like to share with you what
 
07:10:27.628 --> 07:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
it's like to sit with a dear friend as
 
07:10:31.468 --> 07:10:31.478 align:start position:0%
she takes the lethal medication and dies
 
07:10:34.310 --> 07:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
using Medical Aid in
 
07:10:37.430 --> 07:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
dying our friend had a rare form of
 
07:10:41.310 --> 07:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
blood cancer and she had a prognosis of
 
07:10:44.830 --> 07:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
six months or less to live her husband
 
07:10:49.868 --> 07:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
had died and they had no children at 85
 
07:10:54.030 --> 07:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
she felt she had lived a completed life
 
07:10:57.110 --> 07:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
and she wanted to use Medical Aid in
 
07:10:59.788 --> 07:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
dying although she lived in New
 
07:11:01.750 --> 07:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this a
 
07:11:05.230 --> 07:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
85-year-old terminally ill Widow
 
07:11:08.070 --> 07:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
traveled back and forth to Vermont many
 
07:11:12.110 --> 07:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
times to fulfill all the requirements
 
07:11:14.670 --> 07:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
friends in Vermont offered their home as
 
07:11:18.070 --> 07:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
the place of her death she chose a day
 
07:11:20.830 --> 07:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
and invited a small number of friends to
 
07:11:24.830 --> 07:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
be with her we celebrated her life that
 
07:11:29.150 --> 07:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
morning during warm and laughter-filled
 
07:11:31.750 --> 07:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
conversations and then short shortly
 
07:11:34.628 --> 07:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon we all went into the home's
 
07:11:38.350 --> 07:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
guest bedroom she sat on the bed propped
 
07:11:42.590 --> 07:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
up by pillows and we all surrounded her
 
07:11:44.628 --> 07:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
she called us her
 
07:11:47.708 --> 07:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
cheerleaders after raising a glass to
 
07:11:51.510 --> 07:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
celebrate the life she had had she drank
 
07:11:55.430 --> 07:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the strong lethal pres
 
07:11:58.270 --> 07:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
prescription but and then for about 10
 
07:12:01.868 --> 07:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
minutes she gave us a running commentary
 
07:12:05.150 --> 07:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
she said okay so now all of you seem to
 
07:12:08.190 --> 07:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
be going up and down and everything's
 
07:12:11.948 --> 07:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit fuzzy definitely
 
07:12:14.830 --> 07:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
quieter and now you're starting to
 
07:12:18.190 --> 07:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
spin this is relaxed
 
07:12:21.110 --> 07:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
unusual I feel like I'm in a rocket
 
07:12:24.388 --> 07:12:24.398 align:start position:0%
being sent out into the most amazing
 
07:12:26.230 --> 07:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
quantum physics
 
07:12:29.628 --> 07:12:29.638 align:start position:0%
thing I think I have about 60 seconds
 
07:12:33.350 --> 07:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
now left to be able to say something I'm
 
07:12:37.150 --> 07:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
so grateful to every single one of you
 
07:12:39.948 --> 07:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
she then drifted into an irreversible
 
07:12:42.628 --> 07:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
sleep and her heart finally stopped
 
07:12:46.110 --> 07:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
beating an hour and 10 minutes later I
 
07:12:48.990 --> 07:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
had that profound honor of holding her
 
07:12:50.948 --> 07:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
hand as she
 
07:12:54.590 --> 07:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
died this experience taught me that we
 
07:12:57.030 --> 07:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't need to fear
 
07:13:01.110 --> 07:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
death if a person is near death anyway
 
07:13:05.750 --> 07:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid in dying is a way to die in
 
07:13:08.230 --> 07:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
Comfort be because the patient I
 
07:13:09.750 --> 07:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's your time if you
 
07:13:14.030 --> 07:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
could just wrap it okay um I ask you to
 
07:13:17.990 --> 07:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
extend this peaceful way of dying to the
 
07:13:20.708 --> 07:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire who qualify for
 
07:13:23.788 --> 07:13:23.798 align:start position:0%

07:13:48.948 --> 07:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
through all of this this afternoon I
 
07:13:50.150 --> 07:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate it my name is Debbie
 
07:13:52.708 --> 07:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
Richardson from Alexandria New Hampshire
 
07:13:54.590 --> 07:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh I come to you as an OB nurse and a
 
07:13:56.830 --> 07:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
hospice nurse um I've been there at the
 
07:13:59.110 --> 07:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of Life and at the end of life
 
07:14:00.628 --> 07:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
and I will just just spend a minute to
 
07:14:02.388 --> 07:14:02.398 align:start position:0%
tell you that life is precious every
 
07:14:04.948 --> 07:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
minute of it labor is very difficult
 
07:14:06.230 --> 07:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes it really is a
 
07:14:08.430 --> 07:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
struggle if you talk to anybody who has
 
07:14:11.590 --> 07:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
ever given birth they really really um
 
07:14:13.510 --> 07:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
go through a very different experience
 
07:14:15.708 --> 07:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
with every child that they deliver death
 
07:14:18.350 --> 07:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
is like that for us as well um I have
 
07:14:20.948 --> 07:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
been part of many deaths um as a hospice
 
07:14:23.750 --> 07:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
nurse I will tell you that there's many
 
07:14:26.670 --> 07:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
things about this bill that I I oppose
 
07:14:28.110 --> 07:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to come out and say
 
07:14:30.468 --> 07:14:30.478 align:start position:0%
that I oppose this bill because hospice
 
07:14:35.270 --> 07:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
is uh very flexible um I have been uh a
 
07:14:36.788 --> 07:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
hospice nurse and have seen people
 
07:14:39.070 --> 07:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
recertified time and time and time again
 
07:14:40.830 --> 07:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
when they've only had six months and
 
07:14:43.350 --> 07:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
they live to be 10 years out you know
 
07:14:44.990 --> 07:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
they end up dropping hospice coming back
 
07:14:47.750 --> 07:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
on hospice so hospice is very fluid um
 
07:14:49.990 --> 07:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
so that terminology in and of itself is
 
07:14:54.310 --> 07:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
a concern but I have seen death um up
 
07:14:56.590 --> 07:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
close and and I know that every person
 
07:14:58.590 --> 07:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
who is part of a hospice program gets a
 
07:15:00.990 --> 07:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
hospice kit and in that hospice kit
 
07:15:03.468 --> 07:15:03.478 align:start position:0%
there's morphine and there's uh Adavan
 
07:15:05.948 --> 07:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
or lorazapam there's howd doll there's
 
07:15:08.310 --> 07:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
medications to support that death and
 
07:15:10.750 --> 07:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the death goes very peacefully
 
07:15:13.070 --> 07:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it goes very difficultly
 
07:15:15.150 --> 07:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
but that the interaction for that needs
 
07:15:17.948 --> 07:15:17.958 align:start position:0%
to happen on the physician level there
 
07:15:20.190 --> 07:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
are medications that we have that we can
 
07:15:23.548 --> 07:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
utilize it needs to be from a person's
 
07:15:25.830 --> 07:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint and what the family is going
 
07:15:27.990 --> 07:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
through for that individual person to
 
07:15:29.948 --> 07:15:29.958 align:start position:0%
help them be able to have a peaceful
 
07:15:31.788 --> 07:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
death because I do believe that peaceful
 
07:15:34.388 --> 07:15:34.398 align:start position:0%
death is obtainable it just maybe we
 
07:15:36.510 --> 07:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
just need to do more research into that
 
07:15:38.230 --> 07:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
but the government does not need to
 
07:15:41.190 --> 07:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
speak into when a person is allowed to
 
07:15:42.750 --> 07:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
die when a government becomes
 
07:15:44.788 --> 07:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
responsible for that decision and
 
07:15:46.830 --> 07:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
allowing that decision to happen that's
 
07:15:49.548 --> 07:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
when you see the Cascade effect and so I
 
07:15:51.628 --> 07:15:51.638 align:start position:0%
just come to you just with real concerns
 
07:15:53.030 --> 07:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill because there's such
 
07:15:55.430 --> 07:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
deceit in it when you no longer put on
 
07:15:57.830 --> 07:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
the cause of death as being because that
 
07:16:00.430 --> 07:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
person took that medication that caused
 
07:16:03.708 --> 07:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
the death then that's deceit that is not
 
07:16:07.468 --> 07:16:07.478 align:start position:0%
that is not it's it's just not right but
 
07:16:11.190 --> 07:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know I I just I feel like our lives
 
07:16:13.110 --> 07:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
however limited are worth living and
 
07:16:14.590 --> 07:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
every breath is precious so thank you
 
07:16:16.990 --> 07:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak and and I hope
 
07:16:19.788 --> 07:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
that you vote no on this thank
 
07:16:31.388 --> 07:16:31.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:37.110 --> 07:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:39.548 --> 07:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
Milner good afternoon thank you for
 
07:16:42.070 --> 07:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
letting me speak my name is Robin mower
 
07:16:44.948 --> 07:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
from Durham but I would like to read
 
07:16:47.310 --> 07:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
comments from um two people who cannot
 
07:16:49.590 --> 07:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
attend first I'm reading for Jill
 
07:16:49.600 --> 07:16:51.310 align:start position:0%
attend first I'm reading for Jill

Walpole I had Polio in 1954 when I was
 
07:16:57.150 --> 07:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
three I've been significantly disabled
 
07:16:59.590 --> 07:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
since I went from poster child with
 
07:17:02.190 --> 07:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
braces and crutches to Liberation in a
 
07:17:05.868 --> 07:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
manual gr chair about 30 years out my
 
07:17:08.430 --> 07:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
disability became Progressive and I now
 
07:17:11.350 --> 07:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
use a Power Tilt recline Elevate
 
07:17:13.868 --> 07:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
wheelchair I'm within a hair's breath of
 
07:17:15.868 --> 07:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
becoming unable to perform my daily
 
07:17:18.670 --> 07:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
functions without assistance before I
 
07:17:20.590 --> 07:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
retired I was a disability rights
 
07:17:22.590 --> 07:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
attorney in the federal Community
 
07:17:24.548 --> 07:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
Services Administration and the Civil
 
07:17:27.350 --> 07:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission I completely
 
07:17:29.070 --> 07:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
understand and respect the position of
 
07:17:31.628 --> 07:17:31.638 align:start position:0%
some in the disability community against
 
07:17:34.270 --> 07:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
this bill as far back as my knowledge of
 
07:17:35.628 --> 07:17:35.638 align:start position:0%
History goes people have been
 
07:17:38.548 --> 07:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
ostracizing us avoiding us ridiculing us
 
07:17:40.948 --> 07:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
locking Us in back rooms abusing us and
 
07:17:43.350 --> 07:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
outright killing us anything that hints
 
07:17:45.110 --> 07:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
of officially sanctioned death
 
07:17:47.990 --> 07:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
correlating with disability is
 
07:17:50.990 --> 07:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
terrifying the other side of the coin is
 
07:17:54.310 --> 07:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
that we possibly more than others are
 
07:17:57.468 --> 07:17:57.478 align:start position:0%
too often denied control over our bodies
 
07:18:00.190 --> 07:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
and our lives and for that matter our
 
07:18:03.388 --> 07:18:03.398 align:start position:0%
deaths I ER on the side of seizing
 
07:18:07.510 --> 07:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
control this bill is not aist it's
 
07:18:10.548 --> 07:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
giving me the control that I want I am
 
07:18:11.868 --> 07:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
comfortable that this bill has
 
07:18:14.230 --> 07:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient safeguards to allow me and no
 
07:18:16.910 --> 07:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
one else to take control of my
 
07:18:19.708 --> 07:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
death second
 
07:18:23.788 --> 07:18:23.798 align:start position:0%
testimony my name this is from Zale z l
 
07:18:26.230 --> 07:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
Barry and I've been a c paliative care
 
07:18:29.270 --> 07:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
physician for 35 years in Vermont
 
07:18:30.788 --> 07:18:30.798 align:start position:0%
initially I was concerned that in
 
07:18:32.868 --> 07:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
inadequate control of pain and other
 
07:18:35.510 --> 07:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
symptoms would spur people to pursue
 
07:18:37.948 --> 07:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
maid that was a time when the specialty
 
07:18:40.628 --> 07:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
of paliative medicine was in its infancy
 
07:18:43.750 --> 07:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
but we are now in a different era now
 
07:18:45.868 --> 07:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
most people who pursue maid are
 
07:18:47.990 --> 07:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
receiving paliative care through hospice
 
07:18:51.110 --> 07:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
or other sources most importantly the
 
07:18:52.910 --> 07:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
safeguards and the Oregon and Vermont
 
07:18:55.030 --> 07:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
laws have been effective at protecting
 
07:18:57.310 --> 07:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
the vulnerable and in limiting the use
 
07:19:00.270 --> 07:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
of made to those with terminal illness
 
07:19:02.788 --> 07:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
but uncontrolled symptomss are not the
 
07:19:04.948 --> 07:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
driver for most people seeking Medical
 
07:19:07.830 --> 07:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying we know from research done
 
07:19:10.388 --> 07:19:10.398 align:start position:0%
in Oregon at elsewhere that most people
 
07:19:12.670 --> 07:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
seeking that service have a strong wish
 
07:19:14.910 --> 07:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
to control their death to avoid
 
07:19:16.510 --> 07:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
suffering and to ensure that death is
 
07:19:18.788 --> 07:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
gentle for both themselves and loved
 
07:19:21.708 --> 07:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
ones Medical Aid in dying must never be
 
07:19:23.750 --> 07:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
used as a substitute for excellent pain
 
07:19:25.670 --> 07:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
management or any other aspect of
 
07:19:28.230 --> 07:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
skilled paliative care but it is
 
07:19:30.270 --> 07:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
valuable whether it is eventually used
 
07:19:32.990 --> 07:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
or not as an assurance to a seriously
 
07:19:35.310 --> 07:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
ill person that if life with terminal
 
07:19:37.788 --> 07:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
illness ever brings them to a condition
 
07:19:39.948 --> 07:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
they consider worse than death that they
 
07:19:41.670 --> 07:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
will be able to die peacefully and
 
07:19:43.548 --> 07:19:43.558 align:start position:0%
comfortably and in a way that does not
 
07:19:46.150 --> 07:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
leave fail and Friends traumatized thank
 
07:19:48.788 --> 07:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
07:19:55.190 --> 07:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:01.910 --> 07:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:03.708 --> 07:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman thank you for
 
07:20:06.150 --> 07:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
pronouncing my last name correctly maybe
 
07:20:07.990 --> 07:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
the first time that's ever happened I
 
07:20:10.708 --> 07:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
got two shots at it you did my name is
 
07:20:12.670 --> 07:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
Liberty Milner I currently live in
 
07:20:15.670 --> 07:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
Barnstead and I am very opposed to this
 
07:20:19.990 --> 07:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh I am chronically disabled woohoo
 
07:20:21.910 --> 07:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
and I have struggled with mental illness
 
07:20:24.388 --> 07:20:24.398 align:start position:0%
for a long time and therefore suicide
 
07:20:26.150 --> 07:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
ideation so this is something that is
 
07:20:27.990 --> 07:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
near and dear to my heart and I will
 
07:20:31.110 --> 07:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
attempt to uh keep it very brief brief
 
07:20:34.070 --> 07:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
as I think that everything that could be
 
07:20:36.788 --> 07:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
said has been said on both sides I will
 
07:20:39.830 --> 07:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
say that I'm very um interested to see
 
07:20:42.788 --> 07:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
the demographics on both sides of the
 
07:20:44.670 --> 07:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
argument it seems that a lot of people
 
07:20:47.190 --> 07:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition or a lot of the
 
07:20:49.270 --> 07:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
young people who are testifying are in
 
07:20:52.388 --> 07:20:52.398 align:start position:0%
opposition um and a lot of those uh who
 
07:20:56.788 --> 07:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
are in favor are um perhaps um older or
 
07:21:00.190 --> 07:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
know people who are older and uh I
 
07:21:02.150 --> 07:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
wanted put it in perspective that this
 
07:21:05.030 --> 07:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill is not just for today it's not for
 
07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years for the
 
07:21:08.910 --> 07:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
terminally ill today this is a bill for
 
07:21:11.430 --> 07:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
the future and when we talk about the
 
07:21:14.030 --> 07:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
possible windfall um about the possible
 
07:21:16.030 --> 07:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
slippery slope that is a legitimate
 
07:21:17.388 --> 07:21:17.398 align:start position:0%
concern that's why we have these
 
07:21:20.110 --> 07:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
meetings is to look towards the future
 
07:21:24.030 --> 07:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to say one I am
 
07:21:26.868 --> 07:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is going to affirm
 
07:21:29.350 --> 07:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
to not just young people to all people
 
07:21:29.360 --> 07:21:31.388 align:start position:0%
to not just young people to all people
that

07:21:31.388 --> 07:21:31.398 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:21:34.948 --> 07:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
suicide is a good thing death is never a
 
07:21:37.030 --> 07:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
good thing death is always a terrible
 
07:21:40.948 --> 07:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
thing um how ever painless it might be
 
07:21:42.590 --> 07:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's silly for us to
 
07:21:44.510 --> 07:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
pretend that we can somehow make it
 
07:21:48.070 --> 07:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
better uh death is never good and I hope
 
07:21:50.510 --> 07:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
that um this bill does not pass and that
 
07:21:54.070 --> 07:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
young people like me who have uh spent
 
07:21:58.910 --> 07:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
days years thinking about suicide uh
 
07:22:00.990 --> 07:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
will not be encouraged
 
07:22:05.388 --> 07:22:05.398 align:start position:0%
to consider it um as a viable option um
 
07:22:07.750 --> 07:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
it hurts everyone around them death
 
07:22:10.388 --> 07:22:10.398 align:start position:0%
hurts everyone no matter how peaceful it
 
07:22:13.230 --> 07:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
may seem and so I don't think that even
 
07:22:15.270 --> 07:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
though this bill intends to make death
 
07:22:19.190 --> 07:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
better and more palatable it won't um I
 
07:22:21.350 --> 07:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
also think I don't like to make
 
07:22:23.830 --> 07:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
comparisons to Nazi German Germany often
 
07:22:28.670 --> 07:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
but I was struck um thinking about how
 
07:22:31.708 --> 07:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
Hitler um first came campaigned for
 
07:22:34.150 --> 07:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
Health Care um that's how the genocide
 
07:22:37.388 --> 07:22:37.398 align:start position:0%
began they used zyon B to kill insects
 
07:22:40.590 --> 07:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
and rats and other animals to prohibit
 
07:22:42.270 --> 07:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
disease and and then they went to the
 
07:22:44.788 --> 07:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
Mental Hospitals those suffering greatly
 
07:22:47.868 --> 07:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
before the Advent of uh Psychotherapy
 
07:22:49.350 --> 07:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
drugs that have been very helpful in
 
07:22:50.910 --> 07:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
treating mental illness they were
 
07:22:52.590 --> 07:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
suffering greatly and one could look at
 
07:22:54.468 --> 07:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
them and say they were better off dead
 
07:22:56.030 --> 07:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
than they're suffering and that is what
 
07:22:57.990 --> 07:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hitler started to do he said they're
 
07:22:59.670 --> 07:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
better off dead than suffering and then
 
07:23:01.468 --> 07:23:01.478 align:start position:0%
the disabled people people were better
 
07:23:03.510 --> 07:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
off dead than suffering and then all of
 
07:23:05.868 --> 07:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
a sudden the Jews and the homosexuals
 
07:23:07.590 --> 07:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the Romany people were being killed
 
07:23:09.190 --> 07:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's your time you can wrap up with
 
07:23:11.948 --> 07:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
one sentence um you all have a very
 
07:23:13.948 --> 07:23:13.958 align:start position:0%
powerful voice as you are in politics
 
07:23:16.030 --> 07:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to use that voice to cry
 
07:23:17.868 --> 07:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
to the citizens that you serve that
 
07:23:19.948 --> 07:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
their life has value and the government
 
07:23:21.350 --> 07:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
will never have a right to take that
 
07:23:35.468 --> 07:23:35.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:37.590 --> 07:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
hi uh my name is Robert lws I'm from
 
07:23:40.468 --> 07:23:40.478 align:start position:0%
penbroke uh I was going to read a a
 
07:23:43.030 --> 07:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
statement from a physician from Vermont
 
07:23:45.190 --> 07:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
but listening to the testimony today uh
 
07:23:46.628 --> 07:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
I decided I wanted to share a couple of
 
07:23:48.110 --> 07:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
personal stories that might hit a little
 
07:23:48.120 --> 07:23:51.190 align:start position:0%
personal stories that might hit a little
harder

07:23:51.190 --> 07:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:53.670 --> 07:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
um let me I have two that I'd like to
 
07:23:56.948 --> 07:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
share um both of these friends of mine
 
07:23:59.350 --> 07:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
have had cancer
 
07:24:02.110 --> 07:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
um right after Thanksgiving my wife and
 
07:24:05.110 --> 07:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
I went out to dinner with uh an ex-
 
07:24:08.708 --> 07:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
cooworker uh who's been battling cancer
 
07:24:12.830 --> 07:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh she had a recurrence of that and um
 
07:24:14.190 --> 07:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
she'd been doing really well she'd gone
 
07:24:16.990 --> 07:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
through latest rounds of chemo um and
 
07:24:18.190 --> 07:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
she looked really good when we were out
 
07:24:20.308 --> 07:24:20.318 align:start position:0%
for breakfast well within three or four
 
07:24:22.910 --> 07:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
weeks she's not doing so well as of
 
07:24:24.830 --> 07:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
today she's back at home she's in the
 
07:24:28.270 --> 07:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
last stage ofus it's throughout her body
 
07:24:28.280 --> 07:24:30.430 align:start position:0%
last stage ofus it's throughout her body
and

07:24:30.430 --> 07:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:24:31.990 --> 07:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
when we were out to breakfast she she
 
07:24:35.110 --> 07:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
had said uh basically I'm waiting for my
 
07:24:37.548 --> 07:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
uh for the cancer to perforate my bowel
 
07:24:38.670 --> 07:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
and to go
 
07:24:42.430 --> 07:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
septic great um we talked about Medical
 
07:24:44.510 --> 07:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying and she was a supporter of
 
07:24:46.670 --> 07:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
it um she didn't know that she'd use it
 
07:24:49.510 --> 07:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
for herself um the other story is just
 
07:24:51.548 --> 07:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
yesterday I had a call from a friend of
 
07:24:53.628 --> 07:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
mine in Massachusetts whose wife had
 
07:24:55.708 --> 07:24:55.718 align:start position:0%
died last week uh she had had lung
 
07:24:57.868 --> 07:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
cancer and had spread to her bones um
 
07:24:59.788 --> 07:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
one of the radiations it had been in her
 
07:25:02.270 --> 07:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
jaw her jaw had broken she had ended up
 
07:25:07.308 --> 07:25:07.318 align:start position:0%
in Hospice of course and uh he his
 
07:25:11.150 --> 07:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
description of her final time was awful
 
07:25:13.670 --> 07:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
um we have to realize that hospice and
 
07:25:17.388 --> 07:25:17.398 align:start position:0%
pallative Care can only do so much
 
07:25:20.388 --> 07:25:20.398 align:start position:0%
um she was literally the strongest
 
07:25:21.990 --> 07:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
physically strongest woman I've ever met
 
07:25:23.910 --> 07:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
she used to do lofing she's a great
 
07:25:27.190 --> 07:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
mechanic he's a mechanic her husband um
 
07:25:29.788 --> 07:25:29.798 align:start position:0%
and she was down to 98 pounds when she
 
07:25:29.798 --> 07:25:31.230 align:start position:0%
and she was down to 98 pounds when she
died

07:25:31.230 --> 07:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
died
 
07:25:31.240 --> 07:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
died
um

07:25:33.110 --> 07:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:38.270 --> 07:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
the the options as it sits now is sure
 
07:25:40.388 --> 07:25:40.398 align:start position:0%
we can knock you all the way out but
 
07:25:41.468 --> 07:25:41.478 align:start position:0%
you're going to die of either
 
07:25:44.388 --> 07:25:44.398 align:start position:0%
dehydration or starvation is that really
 
07:25:45.230 --> 07:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
what we
 
07:25:49.270 --> 07:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
want um I don't think so um I remember
 
07:25:51.670 --> 07:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
my grandmother had had a stroke um this
 
07:25:54.548 --> 07:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
back in 1987 on my last visit up in
 
07:25:57.150 --> 07:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh up to her she couldn't
 
07:25:59.468 --> 07:25:59.478 align:start position:0%
respond to anything and if she could
 
07:26:02.388 --> 07:26:02.398 align:start position:0%
have seen a if she'd had a crystal ball
 
07:26:04.548 --> 07:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
a crystal ball to see what the end of
 
07:26:05.948 --> 07:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
her life was going to be and she's the
 
07:26:08.548 --> 07:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
prototypical Yankee she'd had a crystal
 
07:26:11.230 --> 07:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
ball she'd have put a gun to her head
 
07:26:12.350 --> 07:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's what a lot of
 
07:26:15.510 --> 07:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
people are left to do as we've heard
 
07:26:19.270 --> 07:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
from uh Rebecca her story uh I don't
 
07:26:23.110 --> 07:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
know uh I'm a uh I'm both a vet and I
 
07:26:24.750 --> 07:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
have a disabled brother so I have a lot
 
07:26:26.590 --> 07:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
of the same skin in the game as people
 
07:26:30.868 --> 07:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
that are here um
 
07:26:32.270 --> 07:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
all I know is a lot of the Vets I talk
 
07:26:36.150 --> 07:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
to uh almost out of time get into the
 
07:26:39.110 --> 07:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
microphone up good good uh let me just
 
07:26:41.388 --> 07:26:41.398 align:start position:0%
say if you could look into a crystal
 
07:26:43.868 --> 07:26:43.878 align:start position:0%
ball and see that that was the type of
 
07:26:45.990 --> 07:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
end that you'd have might you not be a
 
07:26:48.830 --> 07:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more supportive of options
 
07:26:50.708 --> 07:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be the freedom State
 
07:26:53.750 --> 07:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's live it thank
 
07:27:04.670 --> 07:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:07.230 --> 07:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
hi there U my name is Hannah Rudy close
 
07:27:10.628 --> 07:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
I've heard it every way um experiencing
 
07:27:11.990 --> 07:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the beginning of Life and the end of
 
07:27:14.430 --> 07:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
life are two things that we all share
 
07:27:16.910 --> 07:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
and each of these stages are natural and
 
07:27:19.590 --> 07:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
worthy of respect However unfortunately
 
07:27:21.510 --> 07:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's an Ever growing interest to try
 
07:27:23.430 --> 07:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
to attack life at the very beginning and
 
07:27:25.868 --> 07:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
the very end so I stand here before you
 
07:27:30.190 --> 07:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
today as a daughter a sister a friend uh
 
07:27:32.430 --> 07:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
resident of Manchester and a Pala of
 
07:27:34.548 --> 07:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
care nurse practitioner and I ask that
 
07:27:37.308 --> 07:27:37.318 align:start position:0%
you oppose HB
 
07:27:39.910 --> 07:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
254 every day of my job I encounter
 
07:27:41.510 --> 07:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who are facing some of the
 
07:27:44.750 --> 07:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
worst news unexpected diagnoses and
 
07:27:46.590 --> 07:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
prognoses difficult decisions
 
07:27:50.350 --> 07:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
significant symptoms and limited time as
 
07:27:52.270 --> 07:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
a result I want to offer my respect and
 
07:27:54.628 --> 07:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
hold space for every personal story
 
07:27:57.190 --> 07:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard here today every end of life
 
07:27:59.788 --> 07:27:59.798 align:start position:0%
experience is hard and unique in their
 
07:28:00.670 --> 07:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
own way
 
07:28:02.910 --> 07:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
way and I think that accompanying
 
07:28:04.868 --> 07:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
someone through their natural death is a
 
07:28:08.190 --> 07:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
very Noble act there are many worthy and
 
07:28:10.350 --> 07:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
compelling arguments that have been made
 
07:28:12.868 --> 07:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
today opposing the bill many of which I
 
07:28:14.750 --> 07:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
too worry about such as the slippery
 
07:28:17.990 --> 07:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
slope and the message that approving
 
07:28:20.830 --> 07:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
this would send to um residents of New
 
07:28:22.948 --> 07:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those who are young old
 
07:28:25.868 --> 07:28:25.878 align:start position:0%
disabled marginalized and alone about
 
07:28:28.910 --> 07:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
their dignity value and worth but I want
 
07:28:30.788 --> 07:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
to highlight what I think we should be
 
07:28:32.990 --> 07:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
focusing our efforts on when considering
 
07:28:35.308 --> 07:28:35.318 align:start position:0%
Care at the end of life rather than
 
07:28:37.230 --> 07:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
looking to provide people who find
 
07:28:38.430 --> 07:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
themselves in one of their most
 
07:28:40.670 --> 07:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable states with a means to end
 
07:28:42.830 --> 07:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
their life on their own terms we should
 
07:28:45.788 --> 07:28:45.798 align:start position:0%
be talking about bolstering resources um
 
07:28:47.830 --> 07:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
to actually care for people through
 
07:28:51.350 --> 07:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
their final months weeks days hours of
 
07:28:53.388 --> 07:28:53.398 align:start position:0%
their life we need to be looking to
 
07:28:55.910 --> 07:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
increase Pala of care availability of
 
07:28:58.270 --> 07:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
caregivers breast bit care providing
 
07:29:01.150 --> 07:29:01.160 align:start position:0%
support to hardworking family caregivers
 
07:29:03.308 --> 07:29:03.318 align:start position:0%
hospice care and hospice houses in the
 
07:29:06.070 --> 07:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
community for individuals facing facing
 
07:29:08.990 --> 07:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
these terminal diagnosis we can and we
 
07:29:10.750 --> 07:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
should be doing more for individuals who
 
07:29:12.990 --> 07:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
are terminally ill individuals who are
 
07:29:15.750 --> 07:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and individuals who are dying
 
07:29:17.788 --> 07:29:17.798 align:start position:0%
more than just considering assisted
 
07:29:20.270 --> 07:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
suicide as a quote unquote option for
 
07:29:22.670 --> 07:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
end of life care so again I ask that you
 
07:29:27.388 --> 07:29:27.398 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 254 thank you thank you
 
07:29:39.270 --> 07:29:39.280 align:start position:0%

timers I've done a lot of exploring
 
07:30:54.070 --> 07:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
around end of life
 
07:30:58.190 --> 07:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
options with just in case in
 
07:31:01.910 --> 07:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
mind and this includes the excellent
 
07:31:06.150 --> 07:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
made Workshop presented early last year
 
07:31:09.430 --> 07:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
by the oser lifelong learning Institute

experience in end of life
 
07:31:25.510 --> 07:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
care this impressed upon me that Medical
 
07:31:28.430 --> 07:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
Aid in dying is no longer the
 
07:31:30.910 --> 07:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
controversial practice
 
07:31:33.830 --> 07:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
those opposing it would have you believe
 
07:31:35.868 --> 07:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
it is an
 
07:31:39.590 --> 07:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
accepted part of compassion end of life
 
07:31:43.350 --> 07:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
care for nearly a quarter of the people
 
07:31:45.388 --> 07:31:45.398 align:start position:0%
in our
 
07:31:48.388 --> 07:31:48.398 align:start position:0%
country at this time I have begun
 
07:31:51.910 --> 07:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
treatment for metastatic breast cancer
 
07:31:55.030 --> 07:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
but it is not curable only
 
07:31:58.628 --> 07:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
treatable and the medium survival rate
 
07:32:00.910 --> 07:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
is 5 years
 
07:32:05.468 --> 07:32:05.478 align:start position:0%
planning for my end of life as well as
 
07:32:08.388 --> 07:32:08.398 align:start position:0%
continuing care for my husband is
 
07:32:10.628 --> 07:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
critical for both of
 
07:32:15.590 --> 07:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
us with death dignity and peace in mind
 
07:32:19.510 --> 07:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
that all options are possible right here
 
07:32:20.750 --> 07:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
in New
 
07:32:23.948 --> 07:32:23.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you to pass this
 
07:32:27.468 --> 07:32:27.478 align:start position:0%
legislation on behalf of my family and
 
07:32:30.830 --> 07:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
the many many others who are facing
 
07:32:33.150 --> 07:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
difficult end of life
 
07:32:36.868 --> 07:32:36.878 align:start position:0%
situations no one can really appreciate
 
07:32:41.910 --> 07:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
how stressful this time of life is until
 
07:32:44.510 --> 07:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
end of the road is in sight and thank

07:33:07.948 --> 07:33:07.958 align:start position:0%
yes we
 
07:33:18.110 --> 07:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:18.120 --> 07:33:23.110 align:start position:0%

07:33:25.868 --> 07:33:25.878 align:start position:0%
okay hi for the record my name is Lisa
 
07:33:30.868 --> 07:33:30.878 align:start position:0%
Bodwin I am a Disability Policy expert
 
07:33:33.910 --> 07:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
um much has been said so I'm trying to
 
07:33:36.190 --> 07:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
modify please do read my written
 
07:33:38.110 --> 07:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
testimony it deviates from what I'm
 
07:33:38.120 --> 07:33:39.670 align:start position:0%
testimony it deviates from what I'm
sharing

07:33:39.670 --> 07:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
07:33:42.830 --> 07:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
now there is evidence of suicide
 
07:33:45.750 --> 07:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
contagion and there is a threat to
 
07:33:48.388 --> 07:33:48.398 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities contrary to
 
07:33:50.270 --> 07:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
what other testimony in the room might
 
07:33:53.670 --> 07:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:57.270 --> 07:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
you this is the 70 page white paper by
 
07:34:01.750 --> 07:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:05.308 --> 07:34:05.318 align:start position:0%
this is the study that demonstrates that
 
07:34:09.510 --> 07:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
suicide rates go up when in states where
 
07:34:12.628 --> 07:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide passes when compared to
 
07:34:14.110 --> 07:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
states that
 
07:34:16.590 --> 07:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
don't this is the list of national
 
07:34:20.270 --> 07:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
disability organizations all of whom
 
07:34:23.750 --> 07:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
oppose physician assisted suicide it is
 
07:34:25.670 --> 07:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
not possible that all of our nation's
 
07:34:29.948 --> 07:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
top Disability Policy experts are wrong
 
07:34:32.430 --> 07:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
this is a handout that you received
 
07:34:37.510 --> 07:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
citing significant problems with the
 
07:34:40.948 --> 07:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
supposed survey that the UNH Survey
 
07:34:43.468 --> 07:34:43.478 align:start position:0%
Center did because New Hampshire
 
07:34:45.670 --> 07:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
Alliance for compassion and choices paid
 
07:34:48.590 --> 07:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
for that product and wrote the
 
07:34:51.150 --> 07:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
questions this is a p pictograph that
 
07:34:54.510 --> 07:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
will help you to read my testimony that
 
07:35:00.190 --> 07:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:03.030 --> 07:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
this is the NIH document that
 
07:35:05.670 --> 07:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the severity of medical
 
07:35:07.910 --> 07:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
ableism which is discrimination against
 
07:35:10.468 --> 07:35:10.478 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities including that
 
07:35:14.468 --> 07:35:14.478 align:start position:0%
82% of doctors self-report that they
 
07:35:16.468 --> 07:35:16.478 align:start position:0%
believe life with a disability is not
 
07:35:19.590 --> 07:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
quite worth as uh not quite as high
 
07:35:23.110 --> 07:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
quality of life as life without it this
 
07:35:25.788 --> 07:35:25.798 align:start position:0%
is the list of
 
07:35:29.270 --> 07:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
concerns abuses and coercion that's been
 
07:35:29.280 --> 07:35:30.750 align:start position:0%
concerns abuses and coercion that's been
put

07:35:30.750 --> 07:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
put
 
07:35:33.308 --> 07:35:33.318 align:start position:0%
together this one tells you that the top
 
07:35:35.190 --> 07:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
five reasons in Oregon have nothing to
 
07:35:38.190 --> 07:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
do with intractable pain but the reasons
 
07:35:41.270 --> 07:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
associated with with um life with a
 
07:35:44.230 --> 07:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
disability like loss of bodily autonomy
 
07:35:46.388 --> 07:35:46.398 align:start position:0%
and not um
 
07:35:49.230 --> 07:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
having not being able to engage and
 
07:35:51.350 --> 07:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
having a feeling of your loss of
 
07:35:54.468 --> 07:35:54.478 align:start position:0%
dignity leapfrogging over the real need
 
07:35:58.510 --> 07:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
to fix inequities in health care is a
 
07:36:01.990 --> 07:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
problem and that is what HB 254 would
 
07:36:05.308 --> 07:36:05.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:08.628 --> 07:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
do lethal prescriptions are also a way
 
07:36:11.270 --> 07:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
to Leap Frog over gaps in two parts of
 
07:36:14.350 --> 07:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
endof Life Care both paliative Care and
 
07:36:16.308 --> 07:36:16.318 align:start position:0%
Pain Management need greater funding and
 
07:36:18.948 --> 07:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
better education as many have said today
 
07:36:21.750 --> 07:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
I apologize but that's your time if you
 
07:36:27.670 --> 07:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:30.670 --> 07:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
sentence I know many people with
 
07:36:32.948 --> 07:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
disabilities who don't have safe and
 
07:36:35.070 --> 07:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
trusting relationships with their health
 
07:36:35.080 --> 07:36:36.230 align:start position:0%
trusting relationships with their health
care

07:36:36.230 --> 07:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
care
 
07:36:38.510 --> 07:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
providers because their health care
 
07:36:40.110 --> 07:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
providers treat them as though their
 
07:36:43.190 --> 07:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
lives are not white quite worth living
 
07:36:46.030 --> 07:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is indeed a threat to vulnerable
 
07:36:49.230 --> 07:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
populations we can do better with pation
 
07:36:54.830 --> 07:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:00.990 --> 07:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:03.308 --> 07:37:03.318 align:start position:0%
thank you um I've sat in many committee
 
07:37:04.670 --> 07:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
meetings and I've never seen a committee
 
07:37:07.150 --> 07:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
as attentive for this long and for all
 
07:37:08.670 --> 07:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
of us and what we've heard today has
 
07:37:10.548 --> 07:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
been very striking for the record my
 
07:37:12.468 --> 07:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
name is Dr Gary soilson I'm a family
 
07:37:14.308 --> 07:37:14.318 align:start position:0%
physician in conquer I've been in
 
07:37:19.070 --> 07:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
practice for 40 years um and uh my I
 
07:37:20.990 --> 07:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'll submit my written testimony I think
 
07:37:22.150 --> 07:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
frankly one of the worst things we
 
07:37:23.750 --> 07:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
should do is to repeat what's been said
 
07:37:26.350 --> 07:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
before and I can't add too much but I do
 
07:37:28.670 --> 07:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
think what's become clear what's in
 
07:37:30.788 --> 07:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
front of us today is the difference
 
07:37:33.670 --> 07:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
between what many of my patients want I
 
07:37:35.590 --> 07:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
I work in paliative care I work in
 
07:37:37.590 --> 07:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
hospice environments I work in nursing
 
07:37:39.308 --> 07:37:39.318 align:start position:0%
home environments as well as in the
 
07:37:41.590 --> 07:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
community and many of my patients who
 
07:37:43.990 --> 07:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
come who are diagnosed with terminal
 
07:37:45.788 --> 07:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
conditions one of the first things that
 
07:37:48.110 --> 07:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
they are looking at is not the the fear
 
07:37:49.910 --> 07:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the of their death that which is a
 
07:37:51.788 --> 07:37:51.798 align:start position:0%
true concern for them but it's it's
 
07:37:53.070 --> 07:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
actually what is that death going to be
 
07:37:54.788 --> 07:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
like and what control will I have over
 
07:37:57.430 --> 07:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
that so in the end they're looking for
 
07:37:59.708 --> 07:37:59.718 align:start position:0%
autonomy they're looking for what what
 
07:38:02.270 --> 07:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
rights they will have I I think those
 
07:38:04.510 --> 07:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
are obvious things that most of us and
 
07:38:06.590 --> 07:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
frankly everybody in the room today has
 
07:38:08.150 --> 07:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
personal experience with it's nothing
 
07:38:10.190 --> 07:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
that a physician necessarily can bring
 
07:38:12.270 --> 07:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
specially to the table but the tools
 
07:38:14.388 --> 07:38:14.398 align:start position:0%
that we have as Physicians and as other
 
07:38:16.270 --> 07:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
health providers are dependent on what
 
07:38:18.190 --> 07:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
you allow us to have as a legislature I
 
07:38:20.270 --> 07:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
think the the bill as constructed I
 
07:38:22.230 --> 07:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of course of this bill
 
07:38:24.670 --> 07:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
gives us a narrow enough definition to
 
07:38:26.990 --> 07:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
move forward in a way that we haven't
 
07:38:29.708 --> 07:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
had before and and will and will and
 
07:38:32.070 --> 07:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
should be used appropriately as we have
 
07:38:34.030 --> 07:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
seen in 10 other states over more than
 
07:38:37.070 --> 07:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
25 years with really no evidence of of
 
07:38:39.270 --> 07:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
misuse abuse and all the concerns that
 
07:38:40.868 --> 07:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
have been raised you have the question
 
07:38:42.468 --> 07:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
in front of us is one of individual
 
07:38:44.830 --> 07:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
autonomy versus Collective concern and
 
07:38:47.670 --> 07:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's a very very valid uh concern and I
 
07:38:50.628 --> 07:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
hope it's one that you can sort out um
 
07:38:53.070 --> 07:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
when I started in practice 40 years ago
 
07:38:55.150 --> 07:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
the tradition if you were if your SP if
 
07:38:56.468 --> 07:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
you were diagnosed with metastatic
 
07:38:58.708 --> 07:38:58.718 align:start position:0%
cancer we went to your family and we
 
07:39:01.270 --> 07:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
asked whether not it was okay to tell
 
07:39:03.070 --> 07:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
the person that seems a little ludicrous
 
07:39:05.350 --> 07:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
today but I see some of some people with
 
07:39:07.868 --> 07:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
my color hair or less hair shaking their
 
07:39:10.070 --> 07:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
heads because that is true and and
 
07:39:11.468 --> 07:39:11.478 align:start position:0%
that's what I learned in my medical
 
07:39:13.308 --> 07:39:13.318 align:start position:0%
training was that people weren't ready
 
07:39:16.190 --> 07:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
to hear about imminent death or or even
 
07:39:18.150 --> 07:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
in the like people couldn't cope with it
 
07:39:20.948 --> 07:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
we moved along 30 years ago to develop
 
07:39:22.708 --> 07:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire some of the earliest
 
07:39:24.308 --> 07:39:24.318 align:start position:0%
and best hospice programs in the United
 
07:39:26.270 --> 07:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
States and we have them but the Caren
 
07:39:27.868 --> 07:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
hospice and the Caren hospice is
 
07:39:29.430 --> 07:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful and it's something that we
 
07:39:31.230 --> 07:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
should really be proud of in our state
 
07:39:33.270 --> 07:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
and our state laws have helped us move
 
07:39:36.270 --> 07:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
that along but it's not always perfect
 
07:39:38.150 --> 07:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
the care we can give there is not always
 
07:39:39.910 --> 07:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
adequate and it doesn't address what
 
07:39:42.150 --> 07:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
someone else already commented about
 
07:39:44.510 --> 07:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
which is patients with in at the end of
 
07:39:46.788 --> 07:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
their life still want that autonomy they
 
07:39:49.308 --> 07:39:49.318 align:start position:0%
may or may not want to lie on morphine
 
07:39:51.190 --> 07:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
in a hospice house I've sat with
 
07:39:53.430 --> 07:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
families sitting vigil I probably think
 
07:39:56.070 --> 07:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
all of you have as well and the looks
 
07:39:58.868 --> 07:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
around the room the glance is why are we
 
07:40:01.670 --> 07:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
exactly doing this um we're doing this
 
07:40:04.628 --> 07:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
because we really don't have tools uh we
 
07:40:06.628 --> 07:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
didn't have tools actually often when
 
07:40:08.030 --> 07:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
you're in that bu situation it's too
 
07:40:09.948 --> 07:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
late the patient is not conscious
 
07:40:12.070 --> 07:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't self- administer but often
 
07:40:13.230 --> 07:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
we're sitting in that environment
 
07:40:14.830 --> 07:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that we were going to get there
 
07:40:16.670 --> 07:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
and family members look at at the
 
07:40:18.948 --> 07:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
caregivers and say why is it that you
 
07:40:20.788 --> 07:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't do so I apologize that's your
 
07:40:23.350 --> 07:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
time absolutely I I finished and set it
 
07:40:25.110 --> 07:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
up and thank you all for your
 
07:40:27.388 --> 07:40:27.398 align:start position:0%
time we have one question if you would
 
07:40:29.868 --> 07:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
you take a question
 
07:40:32.150 --> 07:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
07:40:34.350 --> 07:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much thank you
 
07:40:36.708 --> 07:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
completely to take the C question would
 
07:40:40.270 --> 07:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
you agree with what we have heard here
 
07:40:45.468 --> 07:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
again and again that the um ability to
 
07:40:49.030 --> 07:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
access Quality Health Care in this
 
07:40:53.948 --> 07:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
country is not available to everyone in
 
07:40:57.670 --> 07:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
an equal way and that people with
 
07:41:01.308 --> 07:41:01.318 align:start position:0%
disabilities might fact have a harder
 
07:41:04.388 --> 07:41:04.398 align:start position:0%
time than many others to get access to
 
07:41:06.788 --> 07:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
Quality Healthcare but that this bill
 
07:41:09.910 --> 07:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with that well toasy
 
07:41:11.308 --> 07:41:11.318 align:start position:0%
you you answered my you answer the
 
07:41:13.350 --> 07:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
question the way I would answer it yes I
 
07:41:15.948 --> 07:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
agree that that many of the populations
 
07:41:17.510 --> 07:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from today who are
 
07:41:20.030 --> 07:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
concerned have less ability we
 
07:41:22.548 --> 07:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely should do everything we can
 
07:41:24.110 --> 07:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
um with all the means that we might have
 
07:41:25.670 --> 07:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
to improve the kind of care that's
 
07:41:28.230 --> 07:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
delivered but it has nothing to do with
 
07:41:29.708 --> 07:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of us today today
 
07:41:31.830 --> 07:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
which applies to a very small number of
 
07:41:33.830 --> 07:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
people listen to the people in Vermont
 
07:41:35.948 --> 07:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
and look at the data in the end we're
 
07:41:37.670 --> 07:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
talking about in the state of New
 
07:41:40.628 --> 07:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire probably dozens of people per
 
07:41:42.948 --> 07:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
year who will access this type of care
 
07:41:44.150 --> 07:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of autonomy we're
 
07:41:46.868 --> 07:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
talking about um it's hard for me to
 
07:41:48.468 --> 07:41:48.478 align:start position:0%
believe that despite all what we heard
 
07:41:50.430 --> 07:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
today that this is going to lead to some
 
07:41:52.468 --> 07:41:52.478 align:start position:0%
um some Wellspring of change in how we
 
07:41:55.070 --> 07:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
view the endly any other
 
07:41:57.430 --> 07:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
07:41:59.830 --> 07:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
you Jonathan and having a hard time
 
07:42:04.030 --> 07:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:06.830 --> 07:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
Binger is there an MD after that there
 
07:42:08.708 --> 07:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
is yeah that's why I can't read it yeah
 
07:42:11.910 --> 07:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's exactly it yeah it's Edinger Ed I
 
07:42:14.830 --> 07:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
apologize in the uh the signature comes
 
07:42:18.830 --> 07:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
true yeah so I'm I'm uh Dr Jonathan
 
07:42:20.830 --> 07:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
Edinger I'm a cardiologist at Catholic
 
07:42:22.190 --> 07:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
Medical Center I'm president of the
 
07:42:23.788 --> 07:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine but I'm not here today
 
07:42:25.430 --> 07:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
in that capacity I'm here as just an
 
07:42:27.750 --> 07:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
individual physician in case any of you
 
07:42:29.670 --> 07:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
know me from the board
 
07:42:33.070 --> 07:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
I'm in opposition to the bill um for a
 
07:42:35.308 --> 07:42:35.318 align:start position:0%
couple reasons um some of which I kind
 
07:42:37.628 --> 07:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
of spoke uh over the last couple years
 
07:42:40.270 --> 07:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
against it but I you know this isn't the
 
07:42:43.548 --> 07:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
1970s or 80s anymore we've had a couple
 
07:42:46.990 --> 07:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
um Physicians speak to what it was like
 
07:42:49.468 --> 07:42:49.478 align:start position:0%
back in the day um you know right now
 
07:42:51.468 --> 07:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
the line between chronic illness and
 
07:42:54.430 --> 07:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
terminal illness is very difficult to
 
07:42:57.070 --> 07:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
distinguish uh the bill is very clear
 
07:42:58.750 --> 07:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
and it's being interpreted as being
 
07:43:03.150 --> 07:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
narrow but um these days when somebody
 
07:43:05.750 --> 07:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
gets a diagnosis it's a very very
 
07:43:07.590 --> 07:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
difficult decision to know if it they're
 
07:43:09.788 --> 07:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
going to be quote unquote terminal and
 
07:43:12.270 --> 07:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be dead in six months
 
07:43:13.708 --> 07:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
um that might have been the case in the
 
07:43:16.070 --> 07:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
70s and 80s but right now that's not the
 
07:43:18.948 --> 07:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
case at all um we have um you're going
 
07:43:20.830 --> 07:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
to hear a lot of anecdotes today that
 
07:43:22.190 --> 07:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
are going to pull at the heartstrings
 
07:43:24.388 --> 07:43:24.398 align:start position:0%
and over the course of this uh the life
 
07:43:26.910 --> 07:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill um but this shouldn't be a
 
07:43:29.868 --> 07:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
bill that is um built on motion it
 
07:43:31.628 --> 07:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
should be a bill that's built on
 
07:43:34.308 --> 07:43:34.318 align:start position:0%
objectivity and this area is fraught
 
07:43:37.388 --> 07:43:37.398 align:start position:0%
with subjectivity it's going to be very
 
07:43:41.308 --> 07:43:41.318 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage this um and force it
 
07:43:43.628 --> 07:43:43.638 align:start position:0%
um we had other very kind of learner
 
07:43:45.388 --> 07:43:45.398 align:start position:0%
colleagues and people that are very
 
07:43:47.430 --> 07:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
passionate about their discussions today
 
07:43:50.750 --> 07:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
talk on um their experience in Vermont
 
07:43:53.150 --> 07:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
and other states for example where
 
07:43:56.150 --> 07:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're trying to monitor this and
 
07:43:57.868 --> 07:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's no abuse but it's
 
07:44:00.230 --> 07:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to be very challenging to do that
 
07:44:03.110 --> 07:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't enforce the slope or
 
07:44:05.750 --> 07:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
or statistically follow the slope people
 
07:44:08.510 --> 07:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
jump on and off the slope um it's a
 
07:44:10.388 --> 07:44:10.398 align:start position:0%
philosophical issue it's an emotional
 
07:44:11.788 --> 07:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
issue it's going to be very difficult to
 
07:44:13.468 --> 07:44:13.478 align:start position:0%
track that it's going to be easy for it
 
07:44:14.430 --> 07:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
to be
 
07:44:16.910 --> 07:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
manipulated um you can see people who
 
07:44:18.590 --> 07:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
are dealing with suffering who are going
 
07:44:22.030 --> 07:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
to misinterpret suffering as a means as
 
07:44:24.590 --> 07:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
a reason for why they should die with
 
07:44:26.910 --> 07:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
their chronic illness and that's where
 
07:44:30.750 --> 07:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to get exploited and um Mis
 
07:44:33.230 --> 07:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
misused so I have trouble with the
 
07:44:35.150 --> 07:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
definition of terminal I have trouble
 
07:44:38.708 --> 07:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
with following it um in terms of how you
 
07:44:41.548 --> 07:44:41.558 align:start position:0%
um track the potential for abuse with
 
07:44:43.510 --> 07:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
this I think if you have a gentleman
 
07:44:45.590 --> 07:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
who's been practicing medicine for 40
 
07:44:47.388 --> 07:44:47.398 align:start position:0%
years they are going to be at the
 
07:44:48.628 --> 07:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
Pinnacle of their career they're going
 
07:44:51.150 --> 07:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
to do a very good job at tracking that
 
07:44:53.070 --> 07:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
and being able to make a decision where
 
07:44:55.868 --> 07:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to die very shortly um
 
07:44:58.150 --> 07:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
but I I feel like that's a strong
 
07:45:00.468 --> 07:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
minority in state for what you have for
 
07:45:03.110 --> 07:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
providers you have a lot of growth
 
07:45:04.670 --> 07:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
towards nurse practitioners and
 
07:45:06.308 --> 07:45:06.318 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants that are not going
 
07:45:08.548 --> 07:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
to be skilled in this area there's no
 
07:45:11.750 --> 07:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
provision for um what kind of experience
 
07:45:14.110 --> 07:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
you need to do this I apologize talk
 
07:45:15.910 --> 07:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
about extra time you can wrap it up with
 
07:45:17.468 --> 07:45:17.478 align:start position:0%
a sentence
 
07:45:21.628 --> 07:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
100% um I think you know following up on
 
07:45:23.708 --> 07:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
the other um comments we just need
 
07:45:26.750 --> 07:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
better physical psychological spiritual
 
07:45:30.150 --> 07:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
mental health um care in general this
 
07:45:32.110 --> 07:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
immediately becomes the cheapest and one
 
07:45:34.670 --> 07:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the easiest options to follow in the
 
07:45:36.708 --> 07:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
state for healthc care providers and for
 
07:45:38.230 --> 07:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
providers that are
 
07:45:40.868 --> 07:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
inexperienced and patients that have
 
07:45:44.350 --> 07:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
chronic illnesses it is uh an injustice
 
07:45:47.190 --> 07:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you any questions at all seeing
 
07:45:56.270 --> 07:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:58.628 --> 07:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
steans good evening and thank you for
 
07:46:00.548 --> 07:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
your patience and waiting for me to
 
07:46:03.350 --> 07:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
speak um I have some testimony here that
 
07:46:04.990 --> 07:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'll bring down just a minute takes me a
 
07:46:06.388 --> 07:46:06.398 align:start position:0%
minute to get down and up and I know you
 
07:46:10.308 --> 07:46:10.318 align:start position:0%
want to get finish the two things that I
 
07:46:12.070 --> 07:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
really want to point out I'm I'm not
 
07:46:14.070 --> 07:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
speaking from a doctor's point of view
 
07:46:17.030 --> 07:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
I've had bad experience with parents
 
07:46:20.270 --> 07:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
dying and suffering badly and saying I
 
07:46:23.670 --> 07:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
want to die what can you do and we've
 
07:46:25.948 --> 07:46:25.958 align:start position:0%
researched Switzerland we've re
 
07:46:27.910 --> 07:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
researched all those things we weren't
 
07:46:30.868 --> 07:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
able to do it but so I became a strong
 
07:46:32.868 --> 07:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
believer in this and one of the things I
 
07:46:36.788 --> 07:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to turn talk about as a lawyer is
 
07:46:38.708 --> 07:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
is different than all of the stories
 
07:46:41.110 --> 07:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
that you've heard today I think when you
 
07:46:43.708 --> 07:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
passed legislation one of the things you
 
07:46:46.708 --> 07:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
have to do is go back to the
 
07:46:50.190 --> 07:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
fundamental laws and theories of our
 
07:46:53.230 --> 07:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
country and the best place to find those
 
07:46:55.628 --> 07:46:55.638 align:start position:0%
are in documents like the Declaration of
 
07:46:57.910 --> 07:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
Independence and the New Hampshire state
 
07:46:57.920 --> 07:46:59.948 align:start position:0%
Independence and the New Hampshire state
constitution

07:46:59.948 --> 07:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
07:47:03.070 --> 07:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
the doc Declaration of Independence says
 
07:47:07.350 --> 07:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
that everybody has the inable right to
 
07:47:10.230 --> 07:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
life liberty and the pursuit of
 
07:47:13.070 --> 07:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
happiness New Hampshire Constitution
 
07:47:18.990 --> 07:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
says that men have the inherent right to
 
07:47:25.430 --> 07:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
um seek uh to life and seeking happiness
 
07:47:28.590 --> 07:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
now what I think we're talking about
 
07:47:32.388 --> 07:47:32.398 align:start position:0%
here here is life on both ends we've
 
07:47:34.990 --> 07:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
heard people talk about life birthing
 
07:47:37.628 --> 07:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
life and we've heard people talk about
 
07:47:41.830 --> 07:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
death as part of life also I think that
 
07:47:45.070 --> 07:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
life includes death and I think one of
 
07:47:47.590 --> 07:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
the things that we have to do is we have
 
07:47:52.788 --> 07:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
to consider the options that people have
 
07:47:57.270 --> 07:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
to go to die do they want to suffer you
 
07:47:58.510 --> 07:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
heard about a lot of people who have
 
07:48:00.670 --> 07:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
suffered ed through awful things I've
 
07:48:03.830 --> 07:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
experienced it with my family or do you
 
07:48:05.910 --> 07:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
want to go to a
 
07:48:09.910 --> 07:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
medical a doctor who will say I
 
07:48:13.548 --> 07:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
understand your pain I know what happens
 
07:48:15.708 --> 07:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
when they they put you in these rooms
 
07:48:17.388 --> 07:48:17.398 align:start position:0%
and they drug you up and you end up
 
07:48:18.830 --> 07:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
dying because you're not eating and
 
07:48:18.840 --> 07:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
dying because you're not eating and
you're

07:48:19.910 --> 07:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're
 
07:48:23.948 --> 07:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
dehydrated and I respect that and if you
 
07:48:28.110 --> 07:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
want to die here's a way to do it and I
 
07:48:30.350 --> 07:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
think that respect that individual
 
07:48:33.708 --> 07:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
respect of people's wishes is what makes
 
07:48:36.948 --> 07:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the United States a
 
07:48:41.628 --> 07:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
great place and if we if we start um
 
07:48:44.230 --> 07:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
with the beginning of what is the law
 
07:48:47.430 --> 07:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we're we're trying to overcome here
 
07:48:50.628 --> 07:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's there's a specific law that says if
 
07:48:55.510 --> 07:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
you assist or solicit suicide you've
 
07:48:57.230 --> 07:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
committed a
 
07:49:01.308 --> 07:49:01.318 align:start position:0%
felony that's means that when I when my
 
07:49:03.548 --> 07:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
mother was was going through the that is
 
07:49:05.308 --> 07:49:05.318 align:start position:0%
your time sir if you could just finish
 
07:49:08.590 --> 07:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
up with one sentence I I honestly
 
07:49:11.430 --> 07:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't help her and that's an awful
 
07:49:14.030 --> 07:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
feeling I think each of us as
 
07:49:16.990 --> 07:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and as family members need
 
07:49:20.548 --> 07:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
the right to make decisions about our
 
07:49:32.948 --> 07:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:34.750 --> 07:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members Aubrey
 
07:49:36.510 --> 07:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
Friedman I live in Bridgewater I speak
 
07:49:39.070 --> 07:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill I don't have
 
07:49:42.308 --> 07:49:42.318 align:start position:0%
much to add um I'll just say I've been
 
07:49:45.110 --> 07:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
kind of Lucky in my family we tend to go
 
07:49:47.910 --> 07:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
quickly so there hasn't been these
 
07:49:51.150 --> 07:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
terrible you know of Agony and cancer
 
07:49:53.430 --> 07:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
and you know that horrible things that
 
07:49:56.590 --> 07:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
people go through uh in many families we
 
07:49:59.308 --> 07:49:59.318 align:start position:0%
go quickly and that it but
 
07:50:02.230 --> 07:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
it still comes down to shouldn't you
 
07:50:05.110 --> 07:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
have the right to choose how you want to
 
07:50:06.468 --> 07:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
die and
 
07:50:09.750 --> 07:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
especially if you are I mean this bill
 
07:50:12.590 --> 07:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
is very narrow so there's been so much
 
07:50:15.308 --> 07:50:15.318 align:start position:0%
you know uh talking about the uh this
 
07:50:18.308 --> 07:50:18.318 align:start position:0%
isn't Canada and and I have to say by
 
07:50:22.350 --> 07:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
the way on that I generally would be for
 
07:50:24.868 --> 07:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
the right to choose then this was a
 
07:50:26.548 --> 07:50:26.558 align:start position:0%
couple years ago then they started
 
07:50:28.948 --> 07:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
talking about the Canada you know the
 
07:50:31.868 --> 07:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
maid program that's a disaster there an
 
07:50:35.590 --> 07:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
absolute disaster and it gave me pause
 
07:50:38.670 --> 07:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
maybe this is not a good road to go but
 
07:50:40.948 --> 07:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is first of all this isn't
 
07:50:43.030 --> 07:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
Canada their health system is different
 
07:50:43.040 --> 07:50:43.788 align:start position:0%
Canada their health system is different
than

07:50:43.788 --> 07:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
than
 
07:50:47.990 --> 07:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
ours quite a bit and this bill is very
 
07:50:50.190 --> 07:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
narrow of course they're started out
 
07:50:51.910 --> 07:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
narrow and it you know there is that
 
07:50:54.110 --> 07:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
possibility there's not no point denying
 
07:50:57.270 --> 07:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
it but the bill as it is without taking
 
07:50:59.150 --> 07:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
all the other things that could happen
 
07:51:02.308 --> 07:51:02.318 align:start position:0%
that might happen I think it's it's got
 
07:51:06.190 --> 07:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
the proper guard rails as it is and so
 
07:51:08.948 --> 07:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with it uh even though
 
07:51:10.670 --> 07:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know there could be abuse or
 
07:51:13.150 --> 07:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
whatever but I think it's pretty good I
 
07:51:14.948 --> 07:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
do have to say one thing I don't agree
 
07:51:16.868 --> 07:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
with in the bill that somebody mentioned
 
07:51:18.990 --> 07:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
it came up a few times you know at the
 
07:51:20.948 --> 07:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
end of the bill about the death
 
07:51:25.708 --> 07:51:25.718 align:start position:0%
certificate and the cause of death it is
 
07:51:29.190 --> 07:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
it it is incorrect and it is not honest
 
07:51:32.868 --> 07:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
to say that it's the underlying cause
 
07:51:36.708 --> 07:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
they tick the poison so that is suicide
 
07:51:41.468 --> 07:51:41.478 align:start position:0%
so I think that part of it is uh is not
 
07:51:43.510 --> 07:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
good it's dishonest that part of the
 
07:51:45.350 --> 07:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill but I don't think we should strike
 
07:51:47.430 --> 07:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
the whole bill down just because of that
 
07:51:51.628 --> 07:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
that's not a major thing the idea behind
 
07:51:54.628 --> 07:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
it to give people choices is good and if
 
07:51:56.990 --> 07:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
you have that part of the end of the
 
07:51:58.750 --> 07:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
bill the record keeping about the death
 
07:52:01.750 --> 07:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
certificate is a little bit uh unless
 
07:52:04.110 --> 07:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's a compelling reason to have it
 
07:52:06.990 --> 07:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
that way I think it's dishonest but the
 
07:52:08.388 --> 07:52:08.398 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill is good and that's why
 
07:52:21.628 --> 07:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:23.708 --> 07:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
Gordon thank you very much for your
 
07:52:27.590 --> 07:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
patience uh and the time and I will try
 
07:52:29.150 --> 07:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh not to do
 
07:52:31.910 --> 07:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
at the
 
07:52:35.270 --> 07:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
stories mic up you're the first person
 
07:52:37.830 --> 07:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
who wanted to hear me
 
07:52:41.788 --> 07:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
talk I've been a lawyer in this state
 
07:52:43.590 --> 07:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
for 50
 
07:52:47.070 --> 07:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
years and when I first came here as a
 
07:52:49.948 --> 07:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
lawyer I worked for a federal
 
07:52:53.430 --> 07:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
judge and he told me a story that I
 
07:52:57.270 --> 07:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
think is appropriate for you and that
 
07:52:59.750 --> 07:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
story was very simple
 
07:53:02.868 --> 07:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
he said when a lawyer comes to you and
 
07:53:06.388 --> 07:53:06.398 align:start position:0%
talks to you about slippery
 
07:53:09.510 --> 07:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
slopes unintentional
 
07:53:12.030 --> 07:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
consequences a parade of
 
07:53:14.270 --> 07:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
horribles that is a
 
07:53:17.628 --> 07:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
signal that the lawyer does not want you
 
07:53:22.708 --> 07:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
to look at and appreciate the underlying
 
07:53:26.628 --> 07:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
facts that are limited to the argument
 
07:53:29.270 --> 07:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
being presented
 
07:53:31.190 --> 07:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
and I would beseech

and don't slide down the slippery
 
07:54:19.030 --> 07:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
slope I worked with Bob Lynn almost 50
 
07:54:19.040 --> 07:54:19.868 align:start position:0%
slope I worked with Bob Lynn almost 50
years

07:54:19.868 --> 07:54:19.878 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:54:23.430 --> 07:54:23.440 align:start position:0%

sitting right there who I never met
 
07:55:17.230 --> 07:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
until I went to Vermont to be a
 
07:55:22.190 --> 07:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
witness to a woman who
 
07:55:24.628 --> 07:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
courageously applied and took medical

this committee several years I will not
 
07:55:54.830 --> 07:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
belabor you with my son's horrific death
 
07:55:57.750 --> 07:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh because I'm not sure you really care
 
07:56:02.308 --> 07:56:02.318 align:start position:0%
anymore frankly but his story is in the
 
07:56:04.670 --> 07:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
pamphlet the booklet that Rebecca has
 
07:56:09.388 --> 07:56:09.398 align:start position:0%
sent to you I will also not repeat um
 
07:56:12.350 --> 07:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary privilege it was to be
 
07:56:16.070 --> 07:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
with our dear friend in Vermont in
 
07:56:18.590 --> 07:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
December and I can attest to you that it
 
07:56:22.030 --> 07:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
was the most beautiful peaceful death I
 
07:56:24.708 --> 07:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
have ever witnessed I've sit with the
 
07:56:27.468 --> 07:56:27.478 align:start position:0%
dying I'm an end of life Doula I left
 
07:56:29.230 --> 07:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
law and became became a end of life
 
07:56:33.708 --> 07:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
Doula after my son died I am a vigil
 
07:56:36.708 --> 07:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
volunteer uh there is lots of talk here
 
07:56:38.830 --> 07:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
about the wonders of hospice and
 
07:56:42.070 --> 07:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
paliative Care let me tell you home
 
07:56:45.110 --> 07:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
hospice leaves the family figuring it
 
07:56:48.350 --> 07:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
out on their own often times family
 
07:56:51.750 --> 07:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
members are afraid to give more
 
07:56:54.308 --> 07:56:54.318 align:start position:0%
medication because they don't want to be
 
07:56:55.708 --> 07:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
accused of
 
07:56:58.230 --> 07:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
overmedicating it was not until I became
 
07:57:01.350 --> 07:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
became aulla that I understood all the
 
07:57:05.350 --> 07:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
signs of pain at the end of life this
 
07:57:08.230 --> 07:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
bill is not about the living it is not
 
07:57:10.548 --> 07:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
about people living with disabilities it
 
07:57:12.388 --> 07:57:12.398 align:start position:0%
is not about people with suicide
 
07:57:16.468 --> 07:57:16.478 align:start position:0%
ideation and depression it is for the
 
07:57:20.070 --> 07:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
dying people who are dying they have no
 
07:57:24.788 --> 07:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
hope of living and I beseech you that
 
07:57:28.430 --> 07:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
you find it in your hearts and as leg
 
07:57:32.308 --> 07:57:32.318 align:start position:0%
legislators to Value the lives of the
 
07:57:35.750 --> 07:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
dying as much as you value the lives of
 
07:57:38.308 --> 07:57:38.318 align:start position:0%
the living I have three points I want to
 
07:57:42.270 --> 07:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
make uh number one about unintended
 
07:57:44.628 --> 07:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
consequences I am a duel of both in New
 
07:57:47.830 --> 07:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in Oregon I have never
 
07:57:51.468 --> 07:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
ever ever seen anyone denied coverage
 
07:57:54.670 --> 07:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
for medical care because they were
 
07:57:57.510 --> 07:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
progressing Beyond ter chronic to
 
07:57:59.868 --> 07:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
terminal illness I have never seen
 
07:58:02.590 --> 07:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
anyone who are in their final days
 
07:58:06.948 --> 07:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
denied care before they choose to enter
 
07:58:13.468 --> 07:58:13.478 align:start position:0%
hospice uh and I would say here
 
07:58:18.468 --> 07:58:18.478 align:start position:0%
that neither my son nor my dear friend
 
07:58:22.190 --> 07:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
um felt fear at the end of their lives
 
07:58:23.948 --> 07:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
my son did not end up using the
 
07:58:26.308 --> 07:58:26.318 align:start position:0%
medication he slipped into a coma
 
07:58:30.070 --> 07:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
beforehand but as as that cancer filled
 
07:58:33.788 --> 07:58:33.798 align:start position:0%
his brain we literally saw his head grow
 
07:58:36.030 --> 07:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
by the day with that
 
07:58:40.350 --> 07:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
cancer and it gave him such Comfort to
 
07:58:43.150 --> 07:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
know that he could take that
 
07:58:47.510 --> 07:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
medication if he needed to be and not
 
07:58:51.030 --> 07:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
suffer trauma for himself his wife and
 
07:58:53.270 --> 07:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
his three-year-old I implore you to
 
07:58:54.868 --> 07:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
support this that's your time you have
 
07:58:57.308 --> 07:58:57.318 align:start position:0%
one more point to make you good I just
 
07:58:59.708 --> 07:58:59.718 align:start position:0%
ask you to listen to the stories we are
 
07:59:02.070 --> 07:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
not pulling heartstrings we bear witness
 
07:59:05.190 --> 07:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the dying it's not a bill about the
 
07:59:20.548 --> 07:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:22.670 --> 07:59:22.680 align:start position:0%

254 and um this is about personal
 
08:00:01.388 --> 08:00:01.398 align:start position:0%
autonomy and about addressing suffering
 
08:00:04.388 --> 08:00:04.398 align:start position:0%
at the end of life as uh so many before
 
08:00:07.468 --> 08:00:07.478 align:start position:0%
me have stated uh there have been a
 
08:00:10.070 --> 08:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
number of uh misstatements that I would

love to correct if we had more time when
 
08:00:14.548 --> 08:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
I first walked in there was a physician
 
08:00:17.150 --> 08:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
I believe talking about injections and
 
08:00:19.150 --> 08:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
paralytic medications I wish

representative Perez was still here um
 
08:00:25.430 --> 08:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
this law does not address intervenous uh
 
08:00:28.070 --> 08:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
administration of medications and
 
08:00:29.708 --> 08:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
neuromuscular blocking agents or
 
08:00:31.990 --> 08:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
paralytics are never used in these
 
08:00:34.350 --> 08:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
combinations of medications I could get
 
08:00:36.430 --> 08:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
into extreme detail and in how these
 
08:00:38.070 --> 08:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
laws and medications are used in other
 
08:00:40.468 --> 08:00:40.478 align:start position:0%
states but we don't have time I will be
 
08:00:42.868 --> 08:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
happy to accept uh any questions and
 
08:00:45.590 --> 08:00:45.600 align:start position:0%

08:00:48.070 --> 08:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
of life for people who are suffering and
 
08:00:50.708 --> 08:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
