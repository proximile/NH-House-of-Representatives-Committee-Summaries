00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
a an increase on those those types of
axles

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
axles
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
for that particular commodity being
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
being carried i was something that they
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh they worked with on the
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh troop g was uh asked for their input
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
on this as well whether it was
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
that the vehicles were capable of doing
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
this type of thing uh
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
it is our opinion that they are capable
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
they can't safely carry that type of
 
00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
they can't safely carry that type of
weight

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
weight
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
i know that the new hampshire department
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
of transportation does have some
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
unattended consequences that they are
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about and they will i'm sure
 
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.470 align:start position:0%
concerned about and they will i'm sure
they

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
someone from that agency will be
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
testifying following me
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
but uh this was a change like i say that
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office did work with
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
with industry in order to try and
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate their particular concerns um
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
that the committee members might have

representative this is actually simply a
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
question for the chair
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
can you just for all of us clarify that
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment is exactly the same

wording as hb
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
279 which um what went to the floor last
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
session it

is the exact language of 279
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
as amended by the committee that went to

1442 and i i want to thank
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
chairman walsh for reintroducing it um
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
and as he confirmed this is basically
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 279
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
that passed this committee on a
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan vote
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
back in february so
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
we we appreciate that that support we
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
got back in february i think it was a
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
13-6 vote
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
my recollection is correct so we
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
i wanted to take a few minutes and kind
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
of reiterate
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
from our perspective why we think this
 
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
from our perspective why we think this
is

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
why we think this is necessary and um
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
and then try to answer some of the
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
um since the last hearing um
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
get recognizing that this is a very
 
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
get recognizing that this is a very
narrow

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
piece of of legislation we're talking
 
00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:51.829 align:start position:0%
piece of of legislation we're talking
about

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
raw forest products leaving a log
 
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.829 align:start position:0%
raw forest products leaving a log
landing

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
landing
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
all right so this is a raw forest
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
product leaving a log landing logs
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
and um and and wood chips
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and and so we're
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're looking as as
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
mr player had mentioned earlier when
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
you're loading
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
a commodity like wood chips or logs on a
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
log landing
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few variables that are
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
in play
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
you have terrain that is uneven
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
you have a for a product that is
 
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
you have a for a product that is
variable

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
variable
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
hardwood is is heavier than softwood
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
um wood chips when they're blown into
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
the back of a a trailer can
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
and you also have have a seasonality of
 
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
and you also have have a seasonality of
it

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you're loading if you're loading uh
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
in winter obviously you're on frozen
 
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
in winter obviously you're on frozen
ground

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
whereas a day like today if you're
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
loading it's the ground is softer
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so if you're on the crane loading a
 
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.069 align:start position:0%
and so if you're on the crane loading a
truck

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
truck
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
you're watching your suspension you're
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
watching how your
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
your load is getting is coming together
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know you watch your springs you
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
watch your air brakes you watch all
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
these things and
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the goal is to try and in
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the case of certified vehicles uh try
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
to become
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
as close to 99 000 gross vehicle weight
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
as you can
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
where it gets really tricky is is with
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
the axle weights and
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
in particular those drive axles those
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
tandem drive axles
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
right on under the tractor and so that's
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's where um we've seen consistently
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
that there's been
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
that there's been a problem um
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
particularly uh
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
as mr platon mentioned with chips when
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're blowing chips in
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
um contractors have tried all sorts of
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
tricks and and techniques to try and
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
and adjust for that and you know with
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
with limited success
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
the other piece is is that you don't
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of a scale
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
um again you're you're in you're in the
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
woods you you know unlike a facility
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
um you know where there's where there
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
are scales present you you don't
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
and and so these are these are
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
challenges that when you're out in the
 
00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
challenges that when you're out in the
woods

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
woods
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
and you're loading the other piece that
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think is important
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
to bear in mind is that we're talking
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
about commodity products
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know and so the a response could be
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
well just
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't load as much go you know load the
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
truck half full and
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
and call it good well when you're
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with commodities
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
wood chips logs you know
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
transportation's a huge part of that
 
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.509 align:start position:0%
transportation's a huge part of that
cost

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a huge you know it's a
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
huge determinant
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
on the value of that wood and and and
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
the value
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
of that project so again contractors
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
try trying to you know they work the
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
endeavor to try to get close to that 99
 
00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:53.829 align:start position:0%
endeavor to try to get close to that 99
000

00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that they can hit the
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
axle weights they do
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
the other dynamic that we see in the
 
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.030 align:start position:0%
the other dynamic that we see in the
state

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
and actually within the and this is kind
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
of a more regional
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
approach is that we look and with some
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
contraction we've seen in some of our
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
markets in recent years
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
specifically we've had some power plants
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
closed some wood chip power plants close
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
we've had there was a paper mill in
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
western maine that was lost
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
what we're finding is that these
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
commodities are having to travel
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
further they're having to cross state
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
lines as people are trying to find homes
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
and so new hampshire's when we look at
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know a truck being loaded in new
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know that truck uh is
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know there is inconsistency i should
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
say for that truck when it enters
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
another state
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll point to maine in
 
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.389 align:start position:0%
and i'll i'll point to maine in
particular

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
um you know maine's their tandem
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
they they have they allow 46 000 pounds
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
um you can certify a vehicle to go as
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
high as 46 000 on a pair of tandems in
 
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.870 align:start position:0%
high as 46 000 on a pair of tandems in
maine

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
um and so you know what happens is that
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
you have a vehicle
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
and again we're in a regional
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
marketplace where i'm i'm a trucker i'm
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
hauling off of a main
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
treat or excuse me i'm hauling off of a
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire tree farm
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
um and i'm trying to move a commodity
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
let's say into a main market i'm
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
competing against maine markets and i'm
 
00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
competing against maine markets and i'm
at

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
it at a disadvantage so
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this legislation was
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
one of the key points was to try to
 
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
one of the key points was to try to
provide

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
some consistency with our neighboring
 
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.949 align:start position:0%
some consistency with our neighboring
states

00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
and when a truck is loaded in one state
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
and it moves to another state such as
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
maine in particular
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we're consistent and so that you're
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
you're consistent when you cross those
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
across those lines and when you're
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
moving your your commodity
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
since the since the the february when
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
you heard this last
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know there were some concerns about
 
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.069 align:start position:0%
you know there were some concerns about
well

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
what about you know there were some
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
concerns raised about what about the
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
impact of bridges
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
well we you know say red list bridges or
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
e2 bridges
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're amending a part of the law rsa2
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
266 18 b um that's the
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's the statute where you're amending
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
the certified loads
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
for the certified load statute where
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
these vehicles
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
are they have to obtain a permit
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
to haul these loads those vehicles are
 
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
to haul these loads those vehicles are
already

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
through that regis by virtue of that
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
registration and hauling those loads
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
they're already prohibited from and
 
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
they're already prohibited from and
restricted

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
on crossing those bridges so the concern
 
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.029 align:start position:0%
on crossing those bridges so the concern
that

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
all right you're going to have a lot of
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
heavy trucks kind of going around
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
crossing these bridges there's already
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
checks in place
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
to prohibit that from happening it's
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
and the other piece is that i mean
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
i've spent quite a bit of time in in
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
recent weeks
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
really studying the weight limits and
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
trying to say all right
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
you know that one of the concerns is
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
well this is unprecedented it would
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
require a lot of
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
reinspection we're kind of creating a
 
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.789 align:start position:0%
reinspection we're kind of creating a
new

00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
category of of weight limits for these
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
tandem axles and
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
when i dove into rsa 266
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
18 b there are a couple examples that
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me that said you already
 
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me that said you already
have

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
tandems out there on the highway um
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
again through that through
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
226 18b that
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
that could be you know 40 000 pounds um
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
an example is a single unit
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
three axle um unit where you have
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
you can get it certified to go to a
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
gross vehicle weight of 65
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
000 pounds the
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
a single axle can weigh 22
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
400 you do the simple math and you say
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
if those tandems on the back of that
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
single unit 3 axle
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
then at that point i'm i'm over 40 000
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
pounds on that
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
on those that rear tandem likewise i
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
look at a tri-axle
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
a single unit four axle so you have a
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
truck with a tri-axle in the back
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
again i can go i can get that weighed or
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
certified to go to 73
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
000 pounds so that leaves me and again
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
my single axle limit
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
on that is 20 000 pounds so that leaves
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
me 53
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
000 pounds on that tri-axle on the back
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the rear end of that truck
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
well the way the the current statutes
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
are written
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
i'm allowed no more than one of those
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
axles can haul more than 40
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
000 so again you take take it
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
take that 53 thousands split that up
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
you feasibly you can have a pair of
 
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.510 align:start position:0%
you feasibly you can have a pair of
those

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
those axles in that tri-axle mix
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
um push you know you can have 40 000
 
00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:14.710 align:start position:0%
um push you know you can have 40 000
pounds

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
pounds
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
so again this is i'm looking at this
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
again i spent quite a bit of time trying
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
to understand and decipher this but
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're not you know this is not
 
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.710 align:start position:0%
we're not you know this is not
unprecedented

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and then the the final point that
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
a concern that had raised was well we're
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
making an exist
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
an exception for a special interest um
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
and you know i to that i say we already
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
wired into our statutes statutes do that
 
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.190 align:start position:0%
wired into our statutes statutes do that
already

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
and they do it to recognize the
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of a commodity
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
or a marketplace whether the commodity
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
is safe perishable
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a necessary something
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
necessary such as heating oil
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
things of that nature we see it with
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
with maple sap
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
milk and and when we look at our
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
you know we look at maine they have you
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
know they have already forest products
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
they they allow for for forest products
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
again higher weight limits and of course
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
in maine
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
potatoes as well so you see that
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
that is throughout the statute and again
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's to recognize
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
the uniqueness of the commodity the
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which it's being
 
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which it's being
harvested

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
harvested
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
hauled and kind of how it's how it's
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
being brought to market
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
again when i talk to my my members and i
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
talked to folks in and around this and
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
and we did i was part of that meeting
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
with the department of safety you know
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
our first our first
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
question of course was you know one of
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
safety is this
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
is this going to create is this going to
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
create an unsafe circum
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
situation out on the highways and you
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
know we
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
i was i was pleased to hear that they
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
they agreed that it
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know that is not going to happen
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
they believe that this
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know this what what is being
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
proposed is is
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable from a safety perspective and
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
so again i looked at that i said all
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
right safety we can check that box off
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
i look at the you know is it a precedent
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
are we setting a new precedent some kind
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
of crazy weight limit out there that's
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
not already
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
being hauled across the highways no i
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
look at what our neighboring states are
 
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
look at what our neighboring states are
doing

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
and this would bring us in alignment and
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with those
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
um and so again for for us when we look
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
at this we say this just makes
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of a common sense
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
approach to this
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
um and we believe it's it
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
merits another look and again we
 
00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
merits another look and again we
appreciate

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
the committee's review last time and the
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
favorable vote we would hope that you
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
would look favorably on this amendment
 
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.630 align:start position:0%
would look favorably on this amendment
again

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to try to
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
stock

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
stock
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
um what does a trucker have to do if
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're coming in new hampshire
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
or through new hampshire with a heavier
 
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.470 align:start position:0%
or through new hampshire with a heavier
load

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
load
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great that's a great
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
question representative because
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're they're not supposed to um so
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
the scenario back in february that i
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
gave was
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
i can load a truck in in white river
 
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
i can load a truck in in white river
junction

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
junction
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
and be legal i cross the connecticut
 
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.350 align:start position:0%
and be legal i cross the connecticut
river

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
river
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
and on my axles i could be illegal
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to a facility over a
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
wood yard in freiburg
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
as soon as i cross that main border i
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
can be legal again
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
and so really what what happens
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
to your point is if you're coming from
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
out of state into the state of new
 
00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
out of state into the state of new
hampshire

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
you're obligated to abide by our laws
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
and our weight limits
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
and um you're obligated to know what
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
so when you load in white river junction
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
um you are supposed you know you're
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
obligated to know what our limits are
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
and abide by those so that's the
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
obligation on that truck driver
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
you can't follow up yep thank you um
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming this would increase
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
delivery costs
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that then have an impact on the
 
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.950 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that then have an impact on the
commodity

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
commodity
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
this would actually lower delivery costs
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
sorry i meant like what's going on right
 
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%
sorry i meant like what's going on right
now

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i mean exactly this this would
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
this would make us more competitive with
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're getting more we would be getting
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know a couple more tons 4 000 pounds
 
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.430 align:start position:0%
you know a couple more tons 4 000 pounds
more

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
per load again i shouldn't say that
 
00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.350 align:start position:0%
per load again i shouldn't say that
because

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are many instances where you are
 
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.950 align:start position:0%
there are many instances where you are
hauling

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
hauling
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
99 000 pounds on that gross vehicle
 
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.830 align:start position:0%
99 000 pounds on that gross vehicle
weight

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
weight
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
you are legal on a gross vehicle weight
 
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.269 align:start position:0%
you are legal on a gross vehicle weight
but

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
your your drive axles because of the way
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
the load was
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
was you know when you loaded it up the
 
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.549 align:start position:0%
was you know when you loaded it up the
situation

00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
you could still be illegal for actually
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
so we have instances where truckers
 
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
pull their hair out saying wait a minute
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
i loaded i was
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
99 000 pounds i thought i was doing a
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
good job
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
i get out on the highway i go through a
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
weigh station
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
and now i get i get tagged with an axle
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
overweight because my drives were over
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
the 30s
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
the current 36 000 and
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know that's a cost that is a cost to
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
the trucker and
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
it does affect the value of that
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
commodity thank you thank you mr
 
00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:56.149 align:start position:0%
commodity thank you thank you mr
chairman

00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you i do have a couple of
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions and i'll get to the rest of
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh i you may have mentioned it and if
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
you did i apologize uh you mentioned
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
maine has the weight limit for the
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
tax away limit of 46 000 pounds
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
what was remarked i don't have vermont's
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of me when
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
in front of me i can certainly get that
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
when i talk to my
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
couple my truckers that haul over there
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
they said that vermont is
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
is comparable with maine's and that when
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
they configure their vehicles they
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
usually just use the main configuration
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then just out of curiosity what's
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
what's the violation fee how much are
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
these citations
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you violate this rule
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
this law that would be a good question
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
for for mr player i i know it's
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
i as i understand it there it has the
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to escalate
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
but i think we're talking you know
 
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.830 align:start position:0%
but i think we're talking you know
hundreds

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars not tens of
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
thousands but that would be a good
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
question for
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
mr player fair enough i wish i thought
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
um representative tillerson
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr stock
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
i had this question before your
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and you touched on it but i
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
didn't quite understand the answer
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
um you spoke about how they are um
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
they're loading these trucks in the
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
woods and you have the
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
loader on the crane say loading the raw
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
product and there are obviously no
 
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.750 align:start position:0%
product and there are obviously no
scales

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
scales
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
so how is it done is it done are you
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
literally eyeballing
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
the weight that's going into these
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
trucks and then
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
i assume you would be relying on the
 
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.549 align:start position:0%
i assume you would be relying on the
experience

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
of the forestry workers as they do this
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
so can you please clarify
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
how these trucks are even being loaded
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
in the first place to meet these
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
these weight points sure
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
um and you kind of answered your your
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
question to some extent
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
it is it there a lot of it is experience
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
you watch you watch the truck's
 
00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:01.350 align:start position:0%
you watch you watch the truck's
suspension

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
as you load it um you
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
you watch the you know the suspension of
 
00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:08.149 align:start position:0%
you watch the you know the suspension of
it

00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
in the case of logs where you're loading
 
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.510 align:start position:0%
in the case of logs where you're loading
logs

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
logs
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know you have an idea all right i'm
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
loading red oak today
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
i know i can go four logs high
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know i can go for you know three
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
tiers or four logs high when i load
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
when i load it into my onto the the back
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
of my truck
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of it is you you're looking
 
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:31.110 align:start position:0%
and so a lot of it is you you're looking
at

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
kind of the the experience level
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
um where things get really tricky
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
is on some of the seasonality
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
um in the spring of the year when sap is
 
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.389 align:start position:0%
um in the spring of the year when sap is
flowing

00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
flowing
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
you can have logs and chips that weigh
 
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
you can have logs and chips that weigh
more

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
because you got a heavier wetter wood um
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
also talking to to loggers and
 
00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
also talking to to loggers and
contractors

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
and truckers they'll say what will
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
happen is even on a particular woodlot
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
you may have a piece of land that you're
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
cutting and a section of it may be kind
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
of marshy and
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
in kind of heavier soils and kind of wet
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
the same trees same species of trees
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
being pulled off of that
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of growing in that wetter
 
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.909 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of growing in that wetter
soil

00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
soil
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
may be a little bit heavier so again
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
when they're loading it you're
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
constantly watching
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
and you know the you're constantly
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
watching trying to make sure that you
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
can get
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
as close to 99 000 pounds um
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
without going over and also recognizing
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that to the extent that you can
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
try to hit these axle weights but again
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
given some of the variabilities
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and i've had truckers try with
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
onboard scales
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
and again they said what they'll tell me
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
what they've told me time and again is
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know onboard scales are good if
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
you're in a nice flat parking lot
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
or you know in a nice flat area with
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
solid surface but when you're out in the
 
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:00.789 align:start position:0%
solid surface but when you're out in the
woods

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
woods
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
and your truck may be tilted a little
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
bit one way or the other
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
or those axles may be on a spot on that
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
log landing that's a little bit
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
softer than another spot they said the
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
onboard scales
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
really they they don't provide the
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
guidance that you would think
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it is experience and and
 
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:20.710 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it is experience and and
just

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to make sure that you're
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
you're doing what you're which what you
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information you're
 
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information you're
welcome

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.389 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr stock
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm just curious about
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
how you control load weights for a
 
00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
how you control load weights for a
material

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
that can shift like wood chips and how
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
you keep
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
the weight off the the axles um
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
as you're coming out of the woods and
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
you're bouncing around and the chips are
 
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.350 align:start position:0%
you're bouncing around and the chips are
shifting

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
and to get those weights over the axles
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
right do you have to
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
warp at some of the load weight
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
for the truck overall and be below that
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
99 000
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
significantly yeah the
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
good question that the wood chips when
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're blowing them into the truck
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the way they're loaded is typically
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
you'll have a chipper
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
with a spout at the back end of the
 
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.549 align:start position:0%
with a spout at the back end of the
truck

00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
truck
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
and they blow them in um and one of the
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
challenges that you have with wood chips
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that as they blow in of course
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
they they can pack towards the nose of
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
the truck
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
which is your drive axles so contractors
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
what they'll do is they'll put sometimes
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
they'll put a sheet of plywood in there
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
or they'll aim they'll aim the blower um
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
on the on more towards the floor of the
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
truck so that you're not packing in the
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
nose of that trailer
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
and these are you know to to represent
 
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
and these are you know to to represent
telerescue's

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
telerescue's
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
point earlier these are techniques that
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
they try to use
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
to distribute that load once the load is
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
once the the trailer is is loaded the
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
chips really don't
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not going to flow
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
and move around
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
in it they really do tend to pack into
 
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.549 align:start position:0%
in it they really do tend to pack into
it

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
so you know logs they get strapped down
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
they stay put chips for the most part
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're not sloshing around or moving
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
around or shifting
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
they're when they get blown in they're
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
packing in
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
and again even with the techniques that
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
they use
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
you still have challenges of trying to
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
keep that that drive axle
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
do i see representative stephen's hand
 
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.830 align:start position:0%
do i see representative stephen's hand
up

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a follow-up um
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the question that representative
 
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
to the question that representative
polarsky

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
polarsky
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
asked which is when you're in the woods
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
and you're loading up and there's no
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
scale and you go by all these
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
skills to determine your weight
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
when is the first opportunity to get
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
formally weighed in the process of
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
depending on yes that's a great question
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
and depending on where you're delivering
 
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
and depending on where you're delivering
it

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
i mean many of your markets in your
 
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.470 align:start position:0%
i mean many of your markets in your
mills

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
mills
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
um some do have scales um
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
sawmills who buy on volume typically
 
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
sawmills who buy on volume typically
don't

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
so it depends on on the market or the
 
00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.269 align:start position:0%
so it depends on on the market or the
skill

00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
skill
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me the market and whether they
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
have a scale or not
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
so it depends there are many instances
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
where a truck will leave a logging job
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
and go to a mill or a wood yard and not
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
even pass a scale
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
just because they're out in the middle
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
of the woods
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
literally and you know there just isn't
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
a scale
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
unless they travel you know many miles
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
out of their way to find a sand or
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
gravel pit or someplace with a certified
 
00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.069 align:start position:0%
gravel pit or someplace with a certified
scale

00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
scale
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
so you know the there are instances
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
where depending on the market
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's just not practical unless you're
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
really having to go out of your way to
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
after you so there's no
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
advantage to being
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
weighed as soon as possible so that you
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
could correct anything
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
or how how how would you correct
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
like if you were over obviously not
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
under how would you correct
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
a problem at the first opportunity of
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
you just live with that mistake and then
 
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
you just live with that mistake and then
get

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
get to your destination and pay the
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
fines along the way or
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a little bit of both uh you
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
know you'll you'll deliver a load
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of wood chips where
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
they're purchased on a per ton basis
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a you're going to
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
have a weight slip and you're going to
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
look at that you're going to say okay
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
and now that's a gross vehicle weight so
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
they're not going to look at the axle
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
weights and again this bill deals just
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
with axolotls
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
so they'll look at that and they'll say
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay you brought in
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know that that truckload brought in
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh 90 you know 105 000 pounds
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
you were over okay i was chipping mostly
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
oak that day or some sugar maple
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm moving into a part of the stand
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
now or part of the woodlot that's all
 
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.069 align:start position:0%
now or part of the woodlot that's all
pine

00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
pine
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
so i'll adjust i'll adjust my weight in
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of wood i should say the
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
amount of wood that i blow into it
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the case of logs um there are trucks
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
that and if you are hauling
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's pretty good in the case of logs
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
folks have a pretty good sense
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at a you know a 16
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
foot eastern white pipe
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
pine log 18 inches in diameter you know
 
00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.630 align:start position:0%
pine log 18 inches in diameter you know
again

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's some reasonable expectation of
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
what that log is going to weigh
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
and you do a count on your logs but even
 
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.470 align:start position:0%
and you do a count on your logs but even
then

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
many operators what they will do is
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
they'll do checks
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
though i may not pass a scale but what
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'll do is
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
the last load of the day i'll bring it
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
home and
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'll weigh it up you know at my shop at
 
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.069 align:start position:0%
i'll weigh it up you know at my shop at
home

00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
and say all right how am i tracking um
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
again that's but you know what we're
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
looking at here in
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
both of those instances is gross vehicle
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
weight as opposed to axle weights
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
and so that's where again everyone
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
shoots to try to you know they're trying
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
to manage to that gross vehicle weight
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh target and this actually
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
what really gets tricky is when you're
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the specificity particularly
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
of those drive axles
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh thank you
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
chairman stark
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh for testifying today it's also my
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
i um i will be voting in favor of this
 
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.630 align:start position:0%
i um i will be voting in favor of this
amendment

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh but i had a quick question about uh
 
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
uh but i had a quick question about uh
incrementalism

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
incrementalism
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
and whether um when we bump this
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
to 40 000 actual weight
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether we'll run into the same thing
 
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.069 align:start position:0%
whether we'll run into the same thing
with

00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
with uh loaders trying to get right up
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
40 000 that they do with the 36
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
000 now and it's a fault and the second
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
part of that question i wonder if you
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
knew the percentage
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
of time that they exceed this
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
this limit and how that relates to
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
maybe name with with their higher limits
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
does it
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
does it show a lower incidence of
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'll take your your last question first
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
um i don't have statistics on
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
on the exceedances um you know
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
i do know in maine you know when
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
talking to truckers that that are
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
operating in new hampshire
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
and operating in maine what they'll tell
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
me is
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
they are they are much more they are
 
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.790 align:start position:0%
they are they are much more they are
consistently

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
compliant in the state of maine given
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the given the
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
tandem weights there as opposed to new
 
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.109 align:start position:0%
tandem weights there as opposed to new
hampshire

00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
and so but i don't have raw statistics
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
um the other piece though is the
 
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
um the other piece though is the
incrementalism

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
incrementalism
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
and you know i guess what i what we
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is you know we
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a regional and we're
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with a very specific
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
commodity within this regional market
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if i'm i'm hauling
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
other commodities within you know i
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't know to what extent that
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
sand and gravel leaves the state or
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
stays in the state
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
but i know with forest products given
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
the nature of the product
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
given the nature of our marketplace and
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
the very regional nature of it
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
um this consistency piece is
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
is important and i would say
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
in many respects probably unique to us
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
you know you're not there's very small
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
likelihood i could imagine where you
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
would be hauling say sander gravel
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
up to um you know skowhegan maine
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
um to a you know a mill in skowhegan
 
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.589 align:start position:0%
um to a you know a mill in skowhegan
maine

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
from say milford new hampshire but
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
forest products
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
those go skowhegan maine they go over to
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
glens falls
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know they're moving all over because
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's where the mills are so i don't
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
think the incrementalism
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
you know for other commodities i don't
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see that
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
given the nature of the market again
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
um you know i'm not in those other
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
industries but
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
clearly this is given the nature of our
 
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.589 align:start position:0%
clearly this is given the nature of our
markets

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
markets
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's what we're seeing is they're
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
regional and the commodities have to go
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
where there's a willing buyer
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
stock for your testimony which has been
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
pretty thorough this morning
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to ask you
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
or at least just clarify reiterate once
 
00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:05.030 align:start position:0%
or at least just clarify reiterate once
again

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire already letting
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles travel with an axle weight
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
higher than what this amendment proposes
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
on our roads yeah i
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
great question in in you know when i
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
again as i as i testified i took a look
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
when i when i kind of dove into 266
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
18b it really started to
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
unravel how these axle weights work and
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
looking at different trucking
 
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
looking at different trucking
configurations

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
configurations
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know again for a three axle single
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.309 align:start position:0%
you know again for a three axle single
unit

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
you're allowed 22 4 on a single axle
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
your gross vehicle weight can be 65 000
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
so again you take the you know you you
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
take the difference
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
so if i have a steering axle at 22 400
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
i back that off of my my my two rear
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
axles on that
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
three axle unit that's in excess of 40
 
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.150 align:start position:0%
three axle unit that's in excess of 40
000.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
now and and the law is is pretty
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
specific to that
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
because there's there's also a provision
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
in there that
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know they say well it's it's 18 you
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
know there's a there's a provision under
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
266 18b roman 2b that says well you have
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
18 000 18 000 pounds per axle
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're closer than 10
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
feet except
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
if it's a three or four axle single unit
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
so again
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
you get into these rules and kind of how
 
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.270 align:start position:0%
you get into these rules and kind of how
these

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
work it's pretty clear to me
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
that you do have vehicles already on the
 
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.030 align:start position:0%
that you do have vehicles already on the
road

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
with tandems at 40 000 pounds
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
um and again with the tri-axle example
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh i can i can have a a tri-axle
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
where the three the three axles in the
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.150 align:start position:0%
where the three the three axles in the
back

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
are 53 000 pounds but given the
 
00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:03.990 align:start position:0%
are 53 000 pounds but given the
allocation

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
of weight across those three axles i can
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
have two of those three
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
at 20 000 pounds again this is
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
this is a lay person trying to
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
but when i kind of go in and you do the
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
math and you look at the configurations
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
and you say geez
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear to me that there are
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
already vehicles on our highways legally
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
with tandems at at this 40 000 pound
 
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
with tandems at at this 40 000 pound
limit

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
um i again that's that's my read of it
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that's when i did the math and kind
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
of drew it drew it out on paper
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's what i came up with and that's
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
what it appears
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and so um
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that we already prohibit those
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
kinds of vehicles from traveling over
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
e2 bridges and are there any other
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
places where these
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
well yeah the law is clear um
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
and and this is this is in 266
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
18b that there the law is very clear
 
00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
18b that there the law is very clear
that

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
they cannot be driven over h15-44
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
bridges unless the
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
 
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.550 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
transportation

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually authorizes them so there's
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
already restrictions
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
on these vehicles so you know
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
again and when we approached this we
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
looked at it from a safety perspective
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
and he says geez
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
we don't want to create you know if you
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a redless bridge out there
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
we don't i mean we want we need these
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
just like everyone else we said geez we
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to tear them up
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
put any additional stress on but again
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
there's already a check in place
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
your mic's off any other questions from
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much sir
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little sitter next up would be
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you good morning mr chairman
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and members of the committee
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
the department has submitted could you
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
identify who you represent please
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes my name's david rodrigue
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of operations for new
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire department transportation
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for hearing me this
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
morning the department has
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony and i want
 
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.230 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony and i want
to

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
cover um three of our most significant
 
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.030 align:start position:0%
cover um three of our most significant
concerns

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
first i'm responsible
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
to provide weight posting for bridges
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
that cannot support legally loaded
 
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
that cannot support legally loaded
vehicles

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
this this amendment would increase
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
the um axle loads for a very small
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
number of certified vehicles from 36
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
000 pounds to 40 000 pounds
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
the law already provides a 10 percent
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
buffer to bring folks over the limit
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
before they they are written a ticket so
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
this effectively
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
increases the the axle loads
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
um for a tandem axle to 44
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
000 pounds um traveling on our roads and
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
and bridges our this
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment applies to
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 266 18
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
b which is a special class of vehicles
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
which are our certified vehicles
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
when we raid our bridges we use the e2
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
posting to say this this bridge is not
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
suitable for a certified vehicle
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
should this amendment pass we will need
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
to re-rate
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
all of those bridges for what right now
 
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.109 align:start position:0%
all of those bridges for what right now
is

00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
a 40 000 pound um dual axle
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
load to a 44 000 pound
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
which will translate into more
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
e2 posted bridges that e2
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
posting will not just exclude these
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
these forestry trucks it will exclude
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
all of your your trucks that use these
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
two axle configurations
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
all of these certified vehicles so we
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
believe that would be an
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of passing this
 
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.630 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of passing this
bill

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
a second concern is effective
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
axle weights on pavement damage
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
increases at an exponential rate which
 
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.829 align:start position:0%
increases at an exponential rate which
means

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
when when you add an extra pound to an
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
axle it's not a
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
a linear increase to the the damage to
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
the pavement
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
it's an exponential increase so even a
 
00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:48.630 align:start position:0%
it's an exponential increase so even a
modest

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
modest
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
increase to the axle limits
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
of 11 that would translate to
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
one and a half times the damage to our
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
pavement that's
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
what you see in rutted pavement and in
 
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.270 align:start position:0%
what you see in rutted pavement and in
cracked

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
cracked
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
pavement and and so forth
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so the effective axle weight
 
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.069 align:start position:0%
um so the effective axle weight
increases

00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
increases
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
has an exponential increase in the
 
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.190 align:start position:0%
has an exponential increase in the
damage

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
damage
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
on our pavement and then i also wanted
 
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.750 align:start position:0%
on our pavement and then i also wanted
to

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh address the notion um
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
and be very clear that passage of this
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
amendment um allowing heavier axle loads
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
will damage to our roads and
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
and bridges um i think there was some
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding in my original
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
testimony to this bill
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
um when i answered that we would not
 
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.190 align:start position:0%
um when i answered that we would not
necessarily

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
paved more frequently our pavement needs
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
are fiscally constrained not by
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're not constrained by the condition
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
of our pavement
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
um so the passage of this bill would
 
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:57.990 align:start position:0%
um so the passage of this bill would
increase

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
damage to our pavements and bridges
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um i do also want to ask
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
ask the folks on the committee to please
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
read rsa 266 18
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
b what you'll find is
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes um vehicles are limited
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
by their total weight gross vehicle
 
00:50:21.839 --> 00:50:22.630 align:start position:0%
by their total weight gross vehicle
weight

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
weight
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
and sometimes by their axle
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
weights it's my read of this that the
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
axle weights
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
are pretty consistently regulated at 18
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
000 pounds each or 36 000
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
pounds for a dual axle
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
so please pay attention to um
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
the wording in the law that will be
 
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
the wording in the law that will be
informative

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
informative
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
to how you see this this change
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
 
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.190 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
questions

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative barron mr chair
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr rodriguez for uh coming
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
and testifying this morning so
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to what you have been saying
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
does the 10 overage allowance that you
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
spoke about
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
apply to certified tri-axle trucks
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
and if so aren't you already inspecting
 
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.589 align:start position:0%
and if so aren't you already inspecting
bridges

00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't understand yeah your
 
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.710 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't understand yeah your
question

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
well you were saying that you know you
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
that that when you inspect the bridges
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
that you already allow for 10 overage
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
islands the
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
law the law allows for 10
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
over the limits that are set forth in
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
the law that is
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
that is correct and that's what we rate
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
the bridges up
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay but that that 10 percent overage
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
allowance also applies to certified
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
tri-axle trucks right
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct so are you
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
aren't you already inspecting oh good
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
aren't you already inspecting bridges at
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
that level
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the the tri-axle
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
portion of the law that i read in 266
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
18-bit is um
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
number three and that refers to the
 
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.150 align:start position:0%
number three and that refers to the
allowable

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
gross weight of a vehicle not the axle
 
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.790 align:start position:0%
gross weight of a vehicle not the axle
loads

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
loads
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
the allowable gross weight and that is
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
where the allowable gross weight of the
 
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.150 align:start position:0%
where the allowable gross weight of the
vehicle

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
for a tri-axle with three axles is 65
 
00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
for a tri-axle with three axles is 65
000

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
pounds that includes the steering axle
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
not just the tri-axle which are the
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you thank you thank you
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative sykes
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
at this point what i've heard from you
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
you seem to focus particularly on uh
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
bridges which
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
the state dot has you know um
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
an overriding interest to make sure that
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
they are safe but
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
my question to you is will not the
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
damage to the roads
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
it won't be uh specifically limited to
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
state roads and bridges but
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
in fact will also damage local roads
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
where local
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have to then bear
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
the brunt of its
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
of their repair absolutely
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
so again the poignant point in this
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
is a small 10 to 11
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
increase in weight translates to
 
00:54:13.829 --> 00:54:13.839 align:start position:0%
a one and a half percent increase
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the damage to the pavement when it
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
comes to route
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
to rutting and cracking so
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
when we think of axle loads they're
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
really the
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
the concentration of of the load
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
at a single location which causes uh
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
the most damage when we talk about a
 
00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:35.190 align:start position:0%
the most damage when we talk about a
vehicle

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
a gross vehicle weight that weight
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
spread out over many axles and
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
and tires but axles concentrate the
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
the load at a specific place and that's
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
why we're
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
we pay very close attention to
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
limiting those axle loads to limit the
 
00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:54.870 align:start position:0%
limiting those axle loads to limit the
damage

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
damage
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
to our roadways and bridges as a
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
mr rodrigue my understanding
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that many of these trucks given the
 
00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.589 align:start position:0%
is that many of these trucks given the
rural

00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
rural
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
nature of the the business um
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
will be traveling on rural roads not the
 
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.789 align:start position:0%
will be traveling on rural roads not the
interstate

00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
am i correct in understanding that the
 
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.710 align:start position:0%
am i correct in understanding that the
interstate

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
has a a lower limit for weights than
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
what that is that is contemplated in
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
that that is correct rsa 266 18
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
b for certified vehicles
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
is for weights on non-interstate
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
and general highway systems so these
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
these vehicles are not allowed it
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
allowed with some of these loads on the
 
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.309 align:start position:0%
allowed with some of these loads on the
interstate

00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i put my hand up twice and
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
took it down because i my questions were
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
about municipal roads and i think
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative sykes hit them all thank
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:02.870 align:start position:0%
representative sykes hit them all thank
you

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative o'hara thank you mr
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
chairman just a quick question
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
um what'd you say the weight limit was
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
for e2 bridges
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
so for like what were you guys scaling
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
so so for the track first of all this
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
there's several different sections of
 
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.549 align:start position:0%
there's several different sections of
266

00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
266
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
18b that that referred to tracks
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
tri-axles the portion i'm referring to
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
is 266 18b number three
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
that says the allowable gross weight of
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
a vehicle
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
um shall not be increased by the
 
00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:49.270 align:start position:0%
um shall not be increased by the
addition

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
of trailing axles and so forth
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
and it says for a single unit three axle
 
00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.829 align:start position:0%
and it says for a single unit three axle
vehicle

00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
65 000 pounds that 65 000
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
pounds is a gross vehicle weight it's
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
not the weight of the triax so
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
follow axles real quick sure uh when you
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
were talking about e2 bridges
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes did i hear you correctly when you
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
said it was 40
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
000 pounds you guys certified them at
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry if if i was confusing
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
um when i explained that the the e2
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
posting is for all vehicles
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
that meet the requirement of section of
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
rsa 266 18 b
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
so it's no particular axle weight it's
 
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
so it's no particular axle weight it's
no

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
particular gross vehicle weight it is
 
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:47.910 align:start position:0%
particular gross vehicle weight it is
for

00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
all the vehicles in this category which
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
is what creates the unintended
 
00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:54.630 align:start position:0%
is what creates the unintended
consequence

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
of this amendment to the law the the
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the law is creating
 
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.030 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the law is creating
just

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
a a a small
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
or an exception for a very small number
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
of vehicles
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
which i believe is because the committee
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
understands that there
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
is increased damage so we don't want to
 
00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:15.510 align:start position:0%
is increased damage so we don't want to
accept

00:58:15.510 --> 00:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
all vehicles we just want to accept
 
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.030 align:start position:0%
all vehicles we just want to accept
these

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
these forest product vehicles from this
 
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:22.549 align:start position:0%
these forest product vehicles from this
law

00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
and give them the heavier axle weights
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequence of that is
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
there is no special bridge posting
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
for this new category of of trucks
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's being created
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's amending the law that
 
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:39.670 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's amending the law that
goes

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
and covers all certified vehicles that's
 
00:58:42.799 --> 00:58:43.190 align:start position:0%
and covers all certified vehicles that's
why

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
as we rerun this analysis for all
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
certified vehicles
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
it increases the number of e2 posted
 
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.589 align:start position:0%
it increases the number of e2 posted
bridges

00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
which prohibits all all of the current
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
certified trucks from using those
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
bridges that will now be posted final
 
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.190 align:start position:0%
bridges that will now be posted final
follow-up

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
one more follow it thank you um can you
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
tell me the
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
standard like the weights that you use
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
it it's what we come up with
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
is the most harshest loading
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
of any vehicle in the e2 posting
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
and we run that over each bridge
 
00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.390 align:start position:0%
and we run that over each bridge
individually

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
individually
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a significantly laborious
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
process that we go through our system
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
bridge by bridge
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
so right now where the the harshest
 
00:59:36.559 --> 00:59:37.589 align:start position:0%
so right now where the the harshest
vehicle

00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
may be that that dual axles
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
at 40 000 pounds now the harshest
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle will be those
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
that dual axles at 44 000 pounds
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
we then put together that that loading
 
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.950 align:start position:0%
we then put together that that loading
plan

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
and we run that vehicle over all of our
 
00:59:55.839 --> 00:59:56.789 align:start position:0%
and we run that vehicle over all of our
bridges

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
and determine what additional bridges
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
e2 posted thank you thank you mr
 
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.670 align:start position:0%
e2 posted thank you thank you mr
chairman

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative barron thank you mr chair
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you again mr rodriguez for um
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
so in hearing what you're saying and and
 
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:14.950 align:start position:0%
so in hearing what you're saying and and
i

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
as i understand uh in maine
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
there uh tanner maxwell is
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
44 000 in vermont i believe it's 50.
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
wondering based on what you're saying
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
then is it that our roads and bridges in
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
are not built to the same standard as
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
those in vermont
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
maine and massachusetts perhaps
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question if
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
i may
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
i i queried vermont in in
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
in maine so why did not get into the
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
details of their laws
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
what uh what i have from vermont is from
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
captain kevin andrews
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
who's the chief of safety so
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
what vermont has is a divisible
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
load permit that allows any five
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
axle vehicle that has 51
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
feet between extreme axles
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
to permit to 90 000 pounds
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
our limit is 99 000 pounds
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
their limit for this part of the law is
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
90 000
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
pounds in this it goes on to say
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
this permit does not have any specific
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
axle weights so because they limit it to
 
01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:41.510 align:start position:0%
axle weights so because they limit it to
90

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
90
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
000 pounds they don't measure the
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
the axle weights this goes on to explain
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
that vermont has a divisible load permit
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
that allows any six axle vehicle
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
that is 51 feet between extreme axles
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
to permit to 99 000 pounds
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
this permit requires a vehicle abide
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
by axle limits and number one above
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
and when we go to number one above the
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
axle limits for tandem axles is 36
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
000 pounds the same as new hampshire
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
is today so when i read vermont's law
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i do see that they don't have axle
 
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
i i do see that they don't have axle
limits

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
limits
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
for a vehicle loaded to 90 000 pounds
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
but they still do have axle limits
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
that are consistent two hours for
 
01:02:40.079 --> 01:02:40.789 align:start position:0%
that are consistent two hours for
vehicles

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
up to 99 000 pounds which is what our
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
certified load
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
law requires maine is another story
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
so maine excludes
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
all of their commodities so maine has a
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
weight tolerance for certain vehicles
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
and they go on to explain that a vehicle
 
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:03.829 align:start position:0%
and they go on to explain that a vehicle
loaded

01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
loaded
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
entirely with building materials that
 
01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:07.430 align:start position:0%
entirely with building materials that
absorb

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
moisture during delivery and they go on
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
box sawdust firewood
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%

trucks or transit mix
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
conch and they they go on and accept
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
all the vehicles not just a small
 
01:03:36.319 --> 01:03:40.150 align:start position:0%
all the vehicles not just a small
portion

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
but uh we're we're not changing the
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
allowable gross
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
weight of the vehicle though we're just
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
adjusting how much weight can be
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
distributed among the axles
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative that is correct and
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
my point is
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's that additional weight to the axles
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
that causes the most damage to our roads
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
that were not built
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
to sustain those weights a modest
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
10 percent increase to the axle load
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
increases the damage by one and a half
 
01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
increases the damage by one and a half
times

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for this
 
01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for this
witness

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
witness
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
mr chair go ahead
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr robert for taking the
 
01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr robert for taking the
question

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
does the department of transportation uh
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
keep statistics on
 
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
keep statistics on
commercial

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
sorry i'll start over perhaps you
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear me thank you mr roderick
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
does the department of transportation
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
keep statistics on the volume of
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
commercial trucking in the state the
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
number of movements
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
and if so i'd be curious to know what
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
of the commercial trucking is
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles carrying rare
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
forestry products um
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to know what kind of numbers
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here in the
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
relationship the total number of
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
trucking in the state if you
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
may know that thank you
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for your
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
question we we do not
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
keep those those statistics
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if the the department of
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
safety may have something on that
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
we do not have those statistics i would
 
01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
we do not have those statistics i would
say

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
i i will very quickly concede that this
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
is a relatively small number of
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles um but the law that we're
 
01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.309 align:start position:0%
vehicles um but the law that we're
changing

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
is the office for certified loads again
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
and increases that that number of
 
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:53.109 align:start position:0%
and increases that that number of
vehicles

01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
we have to radar bridges and our roads
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
um for those harshest loads
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative i'm sorry i can't say his
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
last name
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you thank
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
rodriguez um just
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
one quick question how many bridges um
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
would be affected by this how many
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
bridges would would you estimate would
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
no longer
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
be able to carry these loads
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
we will have to do the analysis to
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
to answer answer that question so
 
01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:36.710 align:start position:0%
to answer answer that question so
there's

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
there's a a couple thousand bridges that
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
that we would run through
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
um my my guess is it's going to be in
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the low dozens not in in the hundreds
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
um but any of those bridges that get
 
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.510 align:start position:0%
um but any of those bridges that get
posted

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
posted
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
and prohibit the the other trucks have a
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
significant impact
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
on moving goods and materials in our in
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else see none
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony mr rodrigue
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes uh jeff aims in support of
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
well good morning can everybody hear me

eames i'm a resident of epsom new
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire we own a business
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
called four mountain trucking four
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
mountain companies
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
which is in allenstown new hampshire to
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit more about us you can
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
visit our website
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
um we have seven trucks that are
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
registered in the state we employ
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
six drivers two mechanics along with
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
seven other people that work in the
 
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:30.630 align:start position:0%
seven other people that work in the
woods

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
woods
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned i'm here to support
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
amendment 14
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
42 for a number of different reasons
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
in our forestry operations we try to be
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
as friendly as possible to a piece of
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
ground and minimize the impact
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
of you know a log landing an area where
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
load trucks in order to get a real good
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know idea of how much that truck
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
weighs we need to have a very level
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
piece of ground
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
even with onboard scales we've loaded
 
01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:01.829 align:start position:0%
even with onboard scales we've loaded
trucks

01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
that appear to be legal according to our
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
axle weights we come down
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
onto the level ground and we're off
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
um in order to remedy this
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
for us it would be expensive to excavate
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
the same time there we'd be leaving a
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
larger log landing
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
and we tend to mix up the soils which
 
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.349 align:start position:0%
and we tend to mix up the soils which
prevents

01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
natural regeneration is how a forest you
 
01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:26.789 align:start position:0%
natural regeneration is how a forest you
know

01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
will start to grow 75
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
of our customers are in maine we support
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
a wood chip business a fuel pellet
 
01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:39.189 align:start position:0%
a wood chip business a fuel pellet
business

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
so transporting in new hampshire and
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
then going to maine
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know maine seems a little bit a
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's the word i'm looking for
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
accommodating and understanding
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know how things happen in the forest
 
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
you know how things happen in the forest
with

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
know different weight axle
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
configurations in the sense of how we're
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and i guess to the best of my
 
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
um and i guess to the best of my
understanding

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
20 years ago plus when they increased
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
the weight limits to certified loads
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
they never increase the axle limits
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
to compensate for that increase the way
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
other states have
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's the best of my understanding i
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
tried to do some research on that
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i really couldn't come up with
 
01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.390 align:start position:0%
but i really couldn't come up with
anything

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
concrete but i would like to do some
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
more research on that and get back to
 
01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:36.950 align:start position:0%
more research on that and get back to
the

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
um i guess for the most part
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's all i need to add or want to add
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
that everyone has
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
especially as far as loading trucks i
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
know there's some questions about
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
loading trucks and getting a flavor for
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
how much the truck weighs
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh questions from the
 
01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh questions from the
committee

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's being done thank you again sir
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%

speak to this boat
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
bill 279 which is now
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
currently the amendment before you that

that this bill is taking
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to quickly kind of
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
summarize the points and the reason that
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
i put the bill in
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
in the original bill i was
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
contacted by the forestry industry
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
specifically members of the forestry
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
industry that are really having an issue
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing their best to
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
comply with the gross vehicle weights
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
but they're running into issues hitting
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
this axle gross axle weight
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so we looked at this bill uh when i
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
originally looked at it with jason stock
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
and bob scully from the new hampshire
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
motor transport and we decided we would
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
go and have a meeting with
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and uh with the
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
we went through all of the things that
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
he would heard
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know and safety found that there was
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
no issue i certainly recognized that the
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
d.o.t has a concern about
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
the quality of the roads and the
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
condition of them and we all do it's
 
01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.070 align:start position:0%
condition of them and we all do it's
important

01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
but you have to remember these folks are
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
paying already paying an additional fee
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
to haul this extra weight and when they
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
get stopped and get hung up on a
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
technicality like this where they're not
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
on their
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
overweight on their aggregate but
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're overweight on their axle it just
 
01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.630 align:start position:0%
they're overweight on their axle it just
causes

01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
causes
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
an onerous burden for them to continue
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
to try and operate
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
and as you heard in testimony what is
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
already a very narrow mark
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
for them on profitability so like
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
d.o.t you know also testified in the
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
department transportation excuse me that
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know this is a very small amount of
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
the cargo that's transported over the
 
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
the cargo that's transported over the
roads

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to make an enormous
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
difference in my opinion in the uh
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of wear and tear that are on
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
these roads for the most part
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
these weights are already on the roads
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's just these guys are absorbing the
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
fines and dealing with it and it's
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
really hurting them because they can't
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
meet the current um the current level on
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
a regular basis so
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
these weights are already on the road
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
the damage that is is already occurring
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
in many instances because they're doing
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
their best but they're finding
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
themselves in violation
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i guess if it was such a major issue
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
i i think you'd find that other states
 
01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:03.669 align:start position:0%
i i think you'd find that other states
who

01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
are having a heavier axle weight such as
 
01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.030 align:start position:0%
are having a heavier axle weight such as
maine

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
would not be allowing it because their
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
roads are very similar eyes so i'll just
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
quickly wrap up i know this has run a
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
this hearing has i appreciate chairman
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
walsh and all of you on the committee
 
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.070 align:start position:0%
walsh and all of you on the committee
reconsidering

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
reconsidering
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
this as an amendment to a another bill
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
move this forward i realize it's a small
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
group of people but i will tell you it's
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
a very important group of people within
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
as far as you know keeping the
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
our forest land management in the good
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
order that it is
 
01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i think it's really important that
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
you pass this bill again as you did last
 
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
you pass this bill again as you did last
time

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much thank you many
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
more last call anybody else

is one of them um there's an amendment
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually let me get the numbers from the
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
clerk if you said i'm handy
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh 1442 1536
 
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
1536 is an amendment to part six
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
1372.

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
1372.
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
everybody i just there's a couple people
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
here that are missing
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh i can deal with them in person i just
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh everybody that's remote has all these
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
because i am going to recess this
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
for a brief period so we can we can all
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
have a conversation
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i had a question
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
about process
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
for you my assumption
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
is that you're going to take up each of
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
these amendments
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
individually and will vote up or down on
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
each amendment
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately get to a status
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
point for
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 131 that we will then vote
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
is that that is correct i had
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
it originally looked at uh maybe seeking
 
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
it originally looked at uh maybe seeking
ols

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
ols
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
to do just one amendment with all the
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
parts but it started to get way too
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
complicated uh so i figured i'd just
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
we'll take them one at a time
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i appreciate that and
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
then you you mentioned you're going to
 
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
then you you mentioned you're going to
take

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
a recess is that for caucus purposes or
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
is that for just a break
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's a caucus purpose well call it both
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
if you'd like but
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
use the time for a caucus if you choose
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
the first that hearing went longer than
 
01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
the first that hearing went longer than
i

01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
anticipated so it did thank you mr
 
01:17:54.719 --> 01:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
anticipated so it did thank you mr
chairman

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh we're not saying i don't see no hands
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
from anybody remote so i'm assuming
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
everybody's got the uh all the
 
01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
everybody's got the uh all the
amendments

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so brad excuse me
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
some of us
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay that being said well i'm going to
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
recess until
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
order of 11. so brad if you can shut us
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative do you know what happened
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%

oh okay
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative rich is having trouble
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
finding her link to the meeting if you
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind resending it
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
looks like she's in the attendees i'm
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
promoting her now
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
motion to move for amendment 1536
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just real quick all this is doing
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
is adding
 
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
these vehicles into the decal
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
so it's bought and leased
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh this was a good catch by
 
01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh this was a good catch by
representative

01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think the only discussion i would have
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman is that i believe this was
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the of the bill was in full
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
accord with and
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
it seems like it would be a good thing
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
to add to amend
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and it also matches
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
the language of the firefighter specific
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
sentence regarding that fair enough uh
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
with no further discussion on the
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
amendment i'll ask the clerk to call
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%

01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
sections three and four of part one
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
section three is uh allowing
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
establish a tax credit for folks that
 
01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.229 align:start position:0%
establish a tax credit for folks that
install

01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
install
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
electric charging units right now there
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
are federal programs to incentivize
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
people to buy
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
charges and there may be other programs
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
also the utilities stand to make quite a
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
bit of money with the increased
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
volume and sales so why disincentivize
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
them from providing it right now
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
but this hasn't really been rolled out
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
so i think it's premature to establish
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
section four establishes rate design
 
01:53:48.639 --> 01:53:49.430 align:start position:0%
section four establishes rate design
standards

01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
since we haven't reasonably deployed
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
enough charging units yet to get an idea
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
of the market i think it's premature to
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
do this right now
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you discussion representative
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
i i can get i can get behind uh taking
 
01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:08.629 align:start position:0%
i i can get i can get behind uh taking
out

01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh section four because the
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
one of the prime sponsors of the the
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
legislation was
 
01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
good with that he understood there were
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
some questions about that that needed to
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
be answered and so
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're i'm i'm all good with part four uh
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
section four is the section three take
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
eliminating the
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh tax incentive part that gives me
 
01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:32.790 align:start position:0%
uh tax incentive part that gives me
pause

01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
pause
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
and um it's hard it's unfortunate that
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
the two have been
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
mixed together because i could support
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
one and not support the other and
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
move things along as it stands now i
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
probably want to vote against the
 
01:54:47.119 --> 01:54:48.070 align:start position:0%
probably want to vote against the
amendment

01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
the reason i would do this is because we
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is already behind
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
the charging station wars if you will
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
and it's really important for us to
 
01:55:00.639 --> 01:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
and it's really important for us to
incentivize

01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
um private industry to
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
put these high either high speed or just
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
regular speed charges into our
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the state
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
and it is only enabling legislation it's
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
not like
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
not all communities will choose to give
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
this tax break
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to let local
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
have their say about whether they want
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
to work as hard as they can to get
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
more charging stations in their
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
communities and for that reason i'll
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment as it is but
 
01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:34.470 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment as it is but
would

01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
would uh certainly be pleased to vote
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
for the amendment that takes out part
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
four uh section four only
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
my question would be why should i a
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
non-vehicle driver
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
pay my tax money to go to someone to
 
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:08.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.110 --> 01:56:11.589 align:start position:0%

01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i could answer representative
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
gagne's question
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
um in this way if private businesses put
 
01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:20.310 align:start position:0%
um in this way if private businesses put
in

01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
charges that result in
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
more availability for these charges and
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
that brings more
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
family members to your community because
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
they they need the charger to get there
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
that will in fact improve the business
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
climate and the personal climate for
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
many many
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
individuals within a community and i
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
type of discussion is best left to the
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman um
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
my only thoughts are
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
if this is going to bring more tourists
 
01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:02.310 align:start position:0%
if this is going to bring more tourists
and

01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
money to the businesses why do they need
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh just a question of the chair uh if a
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
part is removed uh
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
does that allow are we allowed under
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
house rules to bring that back up next
 
01:57:27.199 --> 01:57:28.470 align:start position:0%
house rules to bring that back up next
uh

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i can't hear your response
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
we should have stayed in our other room
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
i guess we've finally gotten the bugs
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
worked out
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
any better so so because there is no
 
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
itl on this this would be able to come
 
01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:56.629 align:start position:0%
itl on this this would be able to come
back

01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
as a separate bill single bill next year
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
believe that to be correct yes thank you
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh any further discussion from the
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee on amendment
 
01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.310 align:start position:0%
committee on amendment
14

01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.189 --> 01:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you okay seeing none i'll just
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
turn in a little bit here
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
um i do concur that section four was
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to by the prime sponsor to be
 
01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:27.750 align:start position:0%
agreed to by the prime sponsor to be
removed

01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
as being premature um i also feel
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh part three is premature but even
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
beyond that i just have a
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue with potentially
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
probably not even potentially
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
raising taxes on a certain group of
 
01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:43.430 align:start position:0%
raising taxes on a certain group of
people

01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh just to benefit another group of
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
people based on their choices
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
of personal transportation so i'll be
 
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
of personal transportation so i'll be
supporting

01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment as well um that being
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%

thanks for giving me in a moment
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
um i i am very anxious about adding an
 
02:02:03.599 --> 02:02:04.470 align:start position:0%
um i i am very anxious about adding an
amendment

02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
to a body of work that
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
um i can get behind in support
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
specifically senate bill 131
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to be making some good
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
changes to the to the senate bill and i
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
you know i'm looking forward to
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
supporting the final version that we
 
02:02:22.719 --> 02:02:23.750 align:start position:0%
supporting the final version that we
have

02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
even surprising me the full house voted
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
down and went against the committee's
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house and i'm
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
worried that
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
all those people who wouldn't support
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
in its by itself will then transfer
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
that lack of support to the overriding
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
good that we're trying to accomplish
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
with with senate bill 131
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i'm i'm going to
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
vote against the amendment because i
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
think it's a
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
i i fear that it is a poison pill that's
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
being added
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
unintentionally but that it's being
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
added to the
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the senate bill 131
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you point point taken um
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
i gave a lot of consideration before i
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
decided to add
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
this amendment i was in conversations
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
with a lot of people and i discovered
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
that there was some misunderstanding
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh about the bill uh prior to it being
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh on house session so
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh understanding there's always a chance
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
when you add things
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
i looked at this bill as a bill that we
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
passed as a committee
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
part of my job is to defend our
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee reports uh in spite of all the
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
hard work that was done to the rest of
 
02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:52.870 align:start position:0%
hard work that was done to the rest of
131

02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
131
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
i started fit to uh to add this keep in
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
mind that
 
02:03:58.550 --> 02:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
these these omnibus bills are not my
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
favorite thing to do either
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully i will never see one of
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
these things ever again
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
so uh anybody else
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to 130 coming out to
 
02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
seeing then i'll ask the court to call
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
vice chairman yes clerk votes yes
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%

i wish to speak to it sure
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
i i would um this is
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
pretty clear cut when i saw this
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
that it's an ancient dinosaur that's
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
been forgotten
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
the disabled community is called out as
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
separate from all others in the granite
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
state when it comes to non-photo
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
or non-driver picture identification
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
cards um
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a perfect opportunity
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
to tell our disabled granite staters
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
every part uh the same as the rest of us
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
and this amendment simply strikes
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
um the line that disabled people who do
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
not have a driver's license can get
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
a photo id they're already covered under
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
section a
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
so um i hope everyone could support this
 
02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:49.030 align:start position:0%
so um i hope everyone could support this

you said so
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
some of the time sponsors of the bills
 
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that have been retained are going to do
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
some work and get back to you
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the meantime as that happens you may
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
call back the whole committee to vote on
 
02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
well no what i want to do is as i get
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
some information from some of the
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
sponsors that i'm actually expecting to
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
do some of the work themselves they're
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
their bills
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh when i do get that information i'll
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
reach out to the committee
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh possibly schedule some full committee
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
work sessions
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if you can make it you can and if
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
you don't want to participate you don't
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh we can't be voting on this until
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
later on in the year
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay so there'll be work sessions as
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to subcommittees okay that's
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's the part i was trying to get
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%

02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
be voluntary
