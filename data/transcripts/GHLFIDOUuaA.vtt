00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay it's a 1005 and with that i'll
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
gavel in the beginning of this work
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
session of division three
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh today we have two bills uh that we're
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to talk about and um we're going
 
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
going to talk about and um we're going
to

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
have to assign
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee report writing
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the first one
 
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.909 align:start position:0%
uh the first one
is

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
on sb 412
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
this was related to
 
00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
this was related to
correcting

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
correcting
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
error in the budgeting process where it
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
was the intent of the legislature
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
through the budgeting process to
 
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.469 align:start position:0%
through the budgeting process to
improve

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
improve
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh rates
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
by five percent uh the belief was that
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
by doing that
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
and other uh providers
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be in a better position
 
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
would be in a better position
to

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
pay competitive more competitive wages
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
and therefore uh be able to actually
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
bring in more
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh of a census
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
so we we heard that uh i don't recall
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
anyone having any real issue in last
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
week's working group on on
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
sb 412
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
there was one
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
small thing
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
mr lipman from the department uh said
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
that he thought or intended or desired
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the funds
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
that we appropriate now would lapse at
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
asked mr ripple to work with ols they
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
created an amendment
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
with my name on it although i did
 
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
with my name on it although i did
nothing

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
nothing
but

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment is the same
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
in in section one
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
as section one
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the addition of a sentence
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
starting on line 13
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
that says any portion of said
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation remaining unspent as of
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
june 30 2023
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
shall lapse to the general fund
 
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
shall lapse to the general fund
and

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
as i said i think it was uh mr lippman's
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that it would lapse
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
the reason this seemed to be worthwhile
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
language wasn't clear
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then in the spreadsheets that the
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
department maintains
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
on one of the comment sections of the
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet there
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
it says that there's some line items in
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
there that are near this that are
 
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.230 align:start position:0%
there that are near this that are
non-lapsing

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
so in order to just keep it from getting
 
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
so in order to just keep it from getting
confused

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
confused
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
i offer
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh
 
00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh
one

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.190 align:start position:0%
one
five

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
my eye is just blur
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
one five eight two thank you
 
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
one five eight two thank you
um

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
is there a motion
 
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
is there a motion
on

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
one five eight two and with the motion
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
we can discuss it so i moved
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
second second so moved and seconded
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
so is there any discussion on uh
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
not not seeing any
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
um on the amendments i think we can do a
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
show of hands and then we have to vote
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
on the final bill right
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask i'm going to make
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
ask two questions or do you uh
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
approve otp on this amendment or do you
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
oppose it so
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
first raise your hands if you support
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's looking unanimous are you are you
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's a great room
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.509 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
so you're the official uh substitute
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
today yeah okay so uh i
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
as a courtesy i want to just go over
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
what we just did and give you an
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
can i ask a question just before you uh
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
yes it's not that i've had a chance to
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
read this uh so kevin or mr ripple
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
i know you took out or you added in the
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
words of health and human services
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's also to clarify
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
uh oh is that different i didn't
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
actually notice that
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
let me just say on line six it says the
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner still transmit
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is fine i just wanna make sure
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
that i'm clear that's the only other
 
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.269 align:start position:0%
that i'm clear that's the only other
change

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
i actually wasn't aware of that change
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh let me just take a quick look at the
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
original bill okay
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
so while you're doing that i i'll bring
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative schultz up to speed
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
um so last week we heard
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
in our working group of division three
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh house or senate bill 412. uh 412
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
was intended to be
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
a correction
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
to uh some human error that occurred
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's not clear exactly how we could have
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
avoided there we're still going to
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
figure that out but but we had intended
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
to increase by
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
by five percent the rates that we paid
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
under medicaid to nursing homes
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason the intent of the
 
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.269 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason the intent of the
legislature

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
came across purposes with other
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
technical matters and so they weren't
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
able to to do that
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
although they recalculate
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
every quarter the first quarter was
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 1.2 percent the second
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
quarter was about three point eight
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
percent but it was short of the five
 
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.910 align:start position:0%
percent but it was short of the five
percent

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
and and supposedly in the third quarter
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
it did get up to five percent but what
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to do is to
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
retroactively clean that up and and make
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
good on our promises to the community
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
okay so then we offered an amendment
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
though because the financial issue is
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
does the money lapse
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
or is it able to be carried into the
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
future fiscal year and we clarified that
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
what do you have miss ripple yes so
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
other than the addition of the lapsing
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
language on 13 and 14 you're right uh
 
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.509 align:start position:0%
language on 13 and 14 you're right uh
that's

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of health and human
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
services is the only thing that's
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
changed and i think that's because i
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
think ols did that because there was no
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
previous reference to the commissioner
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
of hhs so they just wanted to clarify
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
good catch by the vice chair
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
all right so so um we will ignore our
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
previous vote and uh we're going to show
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
a raise of hands and support or
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
all right so we're done with that
 
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.550 align:start position:0%
all right so we're done with that
um

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
maybe for my education
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
422 we're about to debate 422 and 422 is
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to be substantially like hb103
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be identical if if the
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
amendment process has worked
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
is it if since the house has already
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
passed 103
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
would would
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
would would we be able to potentially
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
put this on consent or would we still
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
have to put it on the regular calendar
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's best to put it on the regular
 
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
it's best to put it on the regular
calendar

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
all right so so now we'll uh debate it
 
00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:36.629 align:start position:0%
all right so so now we'll uh debate it
um

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
sb 422
 
00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
sb 422
was

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
like hb 103
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
both of them
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:49.670 align:start position:0%
dealt with
creating

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
an adult
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
dental benefit in medicaid
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist today
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
adults are able to
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
get dental care through medicaid if they
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
are a victim of some sort of trauma and
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
they need to get their
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know their mouth repaired but for
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
standard things
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
such as cleaning
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
removal of bad teeth uh
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
the addition of
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
prosthodontics could be removable
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh there they don't have an entitlement
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
one of the three mcos
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i can never remember the name
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
carnitas americas carnitas
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
anyways they have about 22 do you know
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
okay it still sounds like something i
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
get at a mexican buffet
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
a-m-e-r-i-h-e-a-l-t-h

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
that is one of our three mcos they have
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
about 22 percent of our medicaid market
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
they are the newest
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh mco in new hampshire
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
they derive their roots although not no
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
longer formally associated with the
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
catholic charities
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
all the mcos are limited to a profit
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
margin of 1.5 percent
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
and if they spend money on adult dental
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
care which is not covered
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
then they have to do it out of their
 
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
then they have to do it out of their
profits

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
profits
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
so so this particular mco has been very
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
good at
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
at stepping into that void spending
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
their own profit to provide charitable
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
care to this population it's about 22
 
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.310 align:start position:0%
care to this population it's about 22
percent

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
so what 422 did and what 103 did was to
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
establish the
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
dental medicaid benefit
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
there were some distinctions uh
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
one of the distinctions is was is kind
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
of non-germane to the main concept they
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
there's something called a risk corridor
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
that i think health and human services
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
is looked at
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
the house did not look at risk corridor
 
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.070 align:start position:0%
the house did not look at risk corridor
but

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
there they also found a source of money
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
for this which was a
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
a settlement fund from centene
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
that would has money in
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
about 21 to 22 million something in that
 
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
about 21 to 22 million something in that
range

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
so most of the money
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
from that centene settlement fund will
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
end up going to
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh fund the first year or two of this
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
dental medicaid program with a about 2.4
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
million 2.1 2.4 somewhere in there for
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
the risk corridor
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
that was different
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
the other difference was
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
in 103 we amended it
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.350 align:start position:0%
so that
we

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
asked for a co-pay
 
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.230 align:start position:0%
asked for a co-pay
by

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.950 align:start position:0%
by
the

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
dental beneficiaries
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
in a way that emulated
 
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
in a way that emulated
the

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
commercial dental insurance if you have
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
commercial dental insurance you pay a
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
co-pay when you go in to use your dental
 
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.669 align:start position:0%
co-pay when you go in to use your dental
insurance

00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
so in order to establish the fairness
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
principle that these patients are being
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
treated like our taxpayers who are
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
funding this
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
we implemented a co-pay that relied on a
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
waiver that dr finney and the department
 
00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
waiver that dr finney and the department
has

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.950 align:start position:0%
has
gotten

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay but you've gotten
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
good indication that they'll accept it
 
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.230 align:start position:0%
good indication that they'll accept it
okay

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
so so a minor twitch since you last this
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee last saw 103
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
was it was pointed out to me that
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
co-pays are generally not required for
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
people who go in for their cleaning
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
and in the bill and 103
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
we did include the cleaning as something
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
that they would get a copay
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
what this amendment to 422 and the
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that 103 did was it just said
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
that to be compatible with commercial
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
insurance there should be no co-pay on
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
the dental cleanings
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we did was which
 
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.110 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we did was which
was

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
different from the senate version on the
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
said removable prosthodontics
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
available through this program to
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
the elderly people in long-term nursing
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
care facilities or some or on
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
choices for independents
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
um and also our developmentally disabled
 
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
um and also our developmentally disabled
community

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the emotional point
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
on the of this uh carve out for me is
 
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
on the of this uh carve out for me is
that

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
when the united states brings a
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
reservist or a guardsman onto active
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
duty to send them in a hostile fire zone
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
they do a dental readiness check on
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
their teeth and if they have bad oral
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
health what they'll do is they'll remove
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
the bad teeth clean up the gums take
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
care of the infection and then they'll
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
send them into the sandbox with no
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
removable prosthodontics and when they
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
return from the sandbox they still don't
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
get removable prosthodontics
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
get removable prosthodontics
so

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
um so i i think there's another fairness
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
argument that we bring into this
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
about um what we what we do for
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
those on medicaid that isn't being done
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
for those that we will send to fight for
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
us so there's a fairness issue there
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
limits it to dede and the elderly
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
i think those were the main things the
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
the risk corridor
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
getting

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
a co-pay for cleaning in other words
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
there won't be one and then maintaining
 
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
there won't be one and then maintaining
the

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
carve out for removable prosthodontics
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's everything in
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill will do it's meant to
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
make it equal exactly word for word with
 
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
make it equal exactly word for word with
103.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
103.
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
one of the senators asked me in a
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
hearing to do that to make these two
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
bills identical
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
in his mind that was a smart thing to do
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
in my mind the smart thing to do is to
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
do what the senator asked me to do
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why this is identical
 
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.549 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why this is identical
to

00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
the version 103.
 
00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:47.669 align:start position:0%
the version 103.
uh

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%

uh representative
question

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
removable risk quarter you referred to
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
just so that people understand what that
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
is as a result of the sentence
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
settlement which is basically a sentence
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
i understand it miscalculated payment
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
our payments to
 
00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.110 align:start position:0%
our payments to
medicare

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
or from our receipts if you will from
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
or from our receipts if you will from
them

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
and that required us to actually pay
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
back 2.4 million dollars that's what
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that quote risk order calculation is is
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
related to that 2.4 million dollars is
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
paying back
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
cms as a result of that whole settlement
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
where we were
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
getting too much money from
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
so um thank you
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
should have taken a motion to entertain
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
