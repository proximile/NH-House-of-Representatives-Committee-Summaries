hearing on HB 241

good morning thank you
 
00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Vanessa Sheehan and I
 
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro District 43 the town
 
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
of Milford
 
00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 align:start position:0%
in comments I received from my school
 
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
board members I discovered that they
 
00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
were being forced to lose time from
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
their day-to-day work obligations due to
 
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
negotiations for Union contracts
 
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
as we all realize school board members
 
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
are in a thankless community service
 
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
position but they should not have to
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
lose substantial pay or vacation time
 
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
just to fulfill the school board duties
 
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
specifically negotiations
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
the new language shown in this bill
 
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 align:start position:0%
simply defines reasonable opportunity to
 
00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 align:start position:0%
mean prior to 9 A.M or after 6 PM so it
 
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
would be possible for a school board
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
member to satisfy both their elected
 
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
School Board position as well as their
 
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
work obligations
 
00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
police also note that the language of
 
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is specifically written for
 
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
school districts as I'm unaware of any
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
scheduling issues to be concentrated
 
00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
with the school Union negotiations in
 
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
other areas I'm not wishing to affect
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
negotiations with other bargaining units
 
00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 align:start position:0%
such as Municipal Police or fire unions
 
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to take any other
 
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
questions you have thank you for your
 
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
testimony I do have a question are you
 
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 align:start position:0%
aware in the existing contract
 
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
the terms that talk about who represents
 
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
the union and at to what extent they can
 
00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
do that on
 
00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 align:start position:0%
work hours on on school time
 
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's covered in the
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
existing contract
 
00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
um no I don't I just know that it's been
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult for them to settle on a
 
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
time other than in the middle of the day
 
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 align:start position:0%

more information
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
but um as far as why I support this bill
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
HP 241 is a bill designed to accommodate
 
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
the school board members attending
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining units who work a daytime job
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
many times these meetings are scheduled
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
during the middle of the day when many
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
representatives like School Board meet
 
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
members cannot take time off
 
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
from their work obligations without
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
losing their money monetary obligation
 
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.510 align:start position:0%
losing their money monetary obligation
opportunities

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
asking for these meetings to be
 
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
scheduled before 9 A.M or after 6 PM is
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
a small ask
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
please support ought to pass on HB 241
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions although I'm
 
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
not you've already thrown on a couple
 
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
dandies so thank you I assume you you
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
don't know the answers of the ones you
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%

actually schedules the meetings
 
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that comes from and
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
could probably tell you because he's the
 
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
one that gets the schedule
 
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
representing both sides
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
will come in and just tell you when
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're available and
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
um you just kind of have to deal with
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
that there is no
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
um back and forth really it's hey I have
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
these times available I have these times
 
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
available and you just kind of have to
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
stick with it well this past year trying
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
to negotiate
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
um in good faith in allowing
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
um the unions to negotiate during work
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
hours where their pay is protected and
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
my pay is not
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
um we we were forced into meeting at one
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon well for a general
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
contractor when I'm working in Bosco and
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
I have to drive back to Milford you just
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
canceled my entire day's work you just
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
took it right off the table from me
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so we made good faith options to try
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
and meet
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
um in the morning during their work
 
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
schedule and in the afternoon during
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
their work schedule
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
um both of which they they just insisted
 
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
that we have several meetings during the
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
middle of the day so that's that's not
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
good faith from one side to the other
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
making people lose work when their pay
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
is protected
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
furthermore it takes teachers out of
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
their obligation to teach and educate
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
and it takes them out of ongoing
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
education when they negotiate on days
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
that should be a teacher Workshop day
 
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
that takes them out of that ongoing
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
education for their own career so it
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
takes away from students this this bill
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
fixed by law is much better than going
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
before the labor board because quite
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
frankly right now it's not supported in
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
law the law says that the labor board
 
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.769 align:start position:0%
law the law says that the labor board
would

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:43.730 align:start position:0%
would
um

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
oh the labor board wouldn't uphold this
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
as Fair Labor practice at the moment
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
because the law says they don't have to
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
so we need to fix this in law and make
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
it fair for all parties involved this
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill also still allows you with written
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
with consent from both both parties to
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
meet at any time so if you end up having
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
a board that has retired people on it or
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
or the ability to have a flexible
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
schedule you can agree to meet in the
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
middle of the day it doesn't restrict
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
that uh when both parties actually
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
mutually agree upon it it just keeps one
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
party from forcing the other to have to
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
meet during the middle of someone's work
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
day when their pay isn't protected
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
then I'll take any questions if you have
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much for your
 
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.790 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much for your
testimony

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify and it was
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative Granger's question when
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
you said they determine the schedule
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
were you saying that was legal counsel
 
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.290 align:start position:0%
were you saying that was legal counsel
on

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
both sides that we're setting that
 
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
schedule yeah yeah the legal counsel and
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
the union negotiator yeah all right
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni thank you Mr
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh Mr wheel I've
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
taken the question
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
um the in the beginning of negotiations
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
isn't there a time frame that is listed
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
by the two parties
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
can that be negotiated to have later
 
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.829 align:start position:0%
can that be negotiated to have later
meetings

00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:11:00.839 --> 00:11:01.790 align:start position:0%
meetings
um

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes you we there but there isn't in
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
actual practice there has not been much
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
back and forth it's just I'm available
 
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
at these times I don't have any other
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
times available for you uh it has been
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
my experience
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
Bouchard thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.590 align:start position:0%
Bouchard thank you Mr chairman
um

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
do you find it fear that one School
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
Board member
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
will dictate when the times are going to
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
be for negotiations
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
I know from my experience as a
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
negotiator it's an agreement between
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.290 align:start position:0%
both sides
and

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.870 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
well so I don't think that it is Once In
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
in my particular case and experience it
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't just myself but the other
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
negotiator also had work obligations at
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
another school and and used up all of
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
their vacation time to meet this when we
 
00:11:59.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
we were simply asking and and operating
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
in good faith to say hey can we please
 
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
meet early in the morning or at three
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the afternoon still on still
 
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
on payable time
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
um so that you know he wouldn't have to
 
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
use up all his vacation time and and I
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
lose a whole day of pay as a
 
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
self-employed person I don't even get
 
00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh follow-up is is any
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
procedure that both sides need to
 
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.389 align:start position:0%
procedure that both sides need to
uh

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339 align:start position:0%
agree when you're going to meet correct
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
but in practice
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
um by saying they don't have any other
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
times to meet they limit the amount of
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
representative Broody thank you Mr
 
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.910 align:start position:0%
representative Broody thank you Mr
chairman

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.569 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
when you ask outside people like lawyers
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
or whatever to come in to negotiate and
 
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:56.060 align:start position:0%
they give you days when they can come in
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
what would you do if if you couldn't
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
find a day when you wanted to be there
 
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:03.740 align:start position:0%
how would you handle that
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is a schedule that that person has
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
a time available and if they don't have
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
time available that suits your schedule
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
what do you do
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
well certainly the option to find more
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
people in the pool of professionals to
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
negotiate is is always an option so that
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't limit you that much also
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that they have to negotiate
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
during these hours
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
um you know they can set their schedule
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
accordingly and as a school district if
 
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
we would have to retain a different
 
00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
legal counsel or those options are
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
available to you also you're still under
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
this bill you're still allowed to
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate at any time as long as it's
 
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
actually negotiated the time and both
 
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
parties agree upon it as of right now
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's just not the practice that
 
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.449 align:start position:0%
that's just not the practice that
happens

00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for appearing and thank you
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
for your community service and I I
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying how
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
difficult it is for people to get
 
00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:11.269 align:start position:0%
difficult it is for people to get
together

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
um but that's a nature of the of the
 
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.100 align:start position:0%
environment in which we currently exist
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
and and I don't mean this in a rude way
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
at all but did you take this into
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
consideration when you decide to run to
 
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
the school board the kinds of sacrifices
 
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
that you would have to make to uh to be
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
part of this process
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah absolutely I took that into
 
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.690 align:start position:0%
uh yeah absolutely I took that into
account

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately what was communicated
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
to me under the law was that there's
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
negotiation on when negotiations are
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen uh and that's just not
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
the practice uh and that's that's the
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
problem is that you know you're trying
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
to negotiate or you're trying to
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
navigate making a good decision on
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
whether we're to run and represent your
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
community uh in what is represented to
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
you as truth is it just wasn't it's not
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
the practice that's happening
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
um so now you find yourself in a
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
position where the law says one thing
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
and and the indications given are that
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's good uh information and that
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
there'll be good communication back and
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
forth and one side will work with the
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
other to make sure that everybody is
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
mutually represented and it's just not
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
the practice that I've experienced
 
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.829 align:start position:0%
the practice that I've experienced
follow-up

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
negotiations and I've done a little bit
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
of it is um it's this idea of coming
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
together and working through things and
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh and it's best done at the local level
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
so you acknowledge then that there are
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
the current situation allows you uh to
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
sit down with the with the employee
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
group and negotiate uh mutually
 
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
beneficial and acceptable uh times to
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
meet and and things like that correct
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
um no no I do not the the practice is
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
the practice set by the labor board
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
which is one reason why we need
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to clarify is that
 
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
um both sides would set 50 percent of
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
the schedule basically is kind of their
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
understanding and that what they've said
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
but that's not what's happening in
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
practice it's it's really a strong armed
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet now
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.449 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
do you have representative Granger
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
so uh what happens if you just say no
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
like if they say hey we're going to meet
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
this time and what if you just say no
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that well then
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
you're in violation of negotiating in
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
representative did you have one yeah
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah oh it already answered and uh who
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
would I see over here representative
 
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
Broody thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know how your your
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
District handles negotiations but don't
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
you have like a chief negotiator or does
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
the whole school board participate in
 
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
the negotiations
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
um we as a school board will put up two
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
of our school board members on a
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
negotiation team and also including the
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent HR uh assistant
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
superintendent our legal counsel
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
um the the business administrator
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and that's our negotiating team and
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
then when that team is done negotiating
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
we'll bring the full proposal back to
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
the board for ratification
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
um in I think it's important to also
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
note that under this bill nothing
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
changes about the access that the Unions
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
would have to teach your staff HR
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the the business
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
administrator for questions during
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
normal school day this this only
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
pertains to when we're actually going to
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
sit down in a room and have a two or
 
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so if you have a
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
negotiator in two school board members
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
what this would mean if if this didn't
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
go through is that you just couldn't
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
participate in that session but you're
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
still working as a team and they would
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
get back to you
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
um it's just that you don't have actual
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
participation in that meeting
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
correct as as an individual so in the
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
Milford school district in particularly
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
there's there's five school board
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
members and only one of them is retired
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
with a flexible schedule and our our
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
rules require two people to be there as
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
representation of the board
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
um so in this particular case somebody's
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
work schedule would be affected and that
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
depends on what they do for a living how
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Bouchard
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
um have you uh consulted with other
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
uh communities to see if they have the
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
same problem I I have talked to you I
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
know there's there's some difficulty in
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
Wilton New Hampshire with the
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
next up I would like to call Suzanne
 
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
next up I would like to call Suzanne
Shaden

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
Shaden
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
if I'm mispronouncing that I apologize
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh she is representing herself from
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
Milford she is in opposition to the bill
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
and it says you have written testimony I
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
I do I don't have copies for everyone
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if you can just get it to the
 
00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:20.990 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if you can just get it to the
club

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
club
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
um Suzanne sorry
 
00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.770 align:start position:0%
um Suzanne sorry
um

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
nobody pronounces it correctly it's okay
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak to the unfair
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
indiscriminatory nature of this bill
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
I'm shocked and disappointed to see that
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
we've singled out Educators and given
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
them a different set of rules for
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations than every other Public
 
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.470 align:start position:0%
negotiations than every other Public
Employee

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
Employee
 
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
stating that all public employees can
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
meet during the regular work day except
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
for teachers is discrimination how is it
 
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
fair to say that a teacher can work from
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
7 30 to 3 30 and then begin negotiations
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
at 6 pm but every other Public Employee
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
can meet during the workday asking
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
Public School teachers who volunteer to
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
be part of a negotiating team to only be
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
able to meet before 9 A.M or after 6 PM
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
puts an unfair burden on them stating
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
that it impacts instructional time is
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
also discriminatory negotiating during
 
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
the day means that I am working on what
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
makes my school district a better place
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
I'm working on a contract that benefits
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
the teachers and respects the town's tax
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
base my work during that time is just as
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
valuable as being in front of my
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
students I've been on negotiating teams
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
for the last 20 years
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
every time we have made a schedule that
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
accommodates both sides teams from both
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
sides are made up of people that work in
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
the district plus their legal
 
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.250 align:start position:0%
the district plus their legal
professionals

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
school board members do not have to be
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
part of the negotiating team at the
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
table it is their choice typically the
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
board has given their directions to the
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the lawyer we have
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
had board members present one other time
 
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
other than this past year
 
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:54.260 align:start position:0%
and they accommodated our schedules
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
in this past fall Mr Nathaniel who was
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
part of the school board representation
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
during our negotiation and this bill is
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
a clear representation of what Mr
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
Wheeler said during our negotiations
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
Mr wheel was informed that by the school
 
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.100 align:start position:0%
district lawyer that the law RSA 273a
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
requires meeting times in places that
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
are set by mutual agreement a law that
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
has been in place for many years and has
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
generally worked both best for both
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
parties Mr Wheeler did not want to meet
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
during the day with the teachers but he
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
did find time in his schedule to have
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
daytime meetings with for our custodial
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
staff's negotiations during that same
 
00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is into a direct violation of
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
the current law the current law allows
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
the parties to complete mediation in
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
fact finding with an assigned third
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
party that also always works during the
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
normal business hours these processes
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
have always been completed during the
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
workday it would be impossible to
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
complete these processes before 9 A.M
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
and after 6 PM as a taxpayer I oppose
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
this bill because it will raise our
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
school district budgets because of the
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
cost of an attorney will increase
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically if they are required to
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
meet outside of normal work hours this
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
bill discriminates against all education
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
professionals why are teachers being
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
excluded from a reasonable negotiating
 
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
time who felt the teachers could work
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
from 7 30 to 3 30 and then begin in a
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
negotiation session at 6 PM possibly for
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
four hours was fair not a teacher that's
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
my other comment is I want to talk about
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
my last
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
our sessions for negotiations that we
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
had this year so I quickly looked at my
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
calendar we had seven sessions
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
and we all sat down to agree upon times
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
and yes you do kind of listen to what
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
the lawyer schedules are because this is
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
the toughest schedules to manage and we
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
work around that kind of thing but we
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
all work on mutually
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
agreeable times if we have a workshop
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
day as teachers we can easily catch up
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
on what was missed and that's always
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
been a brilliant time for us to have an
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
extended negotiation session
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
this past fall we attempted to negotiate
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
a contract and we had seven sessions
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
four of those sessions were from seven
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
to nine a.m one was from four to seven
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
PM two were from either one to three or
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
twelve to two and one was from oh one
 
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.970 align:start position:0%
twelve to two and one was from oh one
was

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
nope that's it one two three four five
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
six seven
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
um so we did work around we did try to
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
be accommodating but we have never
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
really had
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
school board members at the table
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
they've always sent their direction we
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
get to appoint negotiations and they say
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you we need to take this back to
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
the board and we come back at another
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
time after they've gotten more
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
directions this is an unfair burden I'm
 
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
asking that if you sponsored this bill
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
please remove don't vote for this bill
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
please remove your name from
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
consideration as Peter Petrino did he
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
listened and he understood that this
 
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.690 align:start position:0%
listened and he understood that this
discriminates

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
discriminates
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions thank you very much
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify in my head
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
were you a part of the negotiating team
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.299 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
my name is Lori Hayes I'm a uniserve
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
director for Nea New Hampshire
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
prior to working I began working for Nea
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2012. I'm 2007 prior to
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
working for Nea New Hampshire I was
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
Chief negotiator for the state employees
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
Association and I work for them
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2003. so my experience here
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire has always been through
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations at no point has there been
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
an issue regarding planning and mutually
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
agreeing to dates until this school year
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
um I want wanted not to make this a um
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
about one individual but I think it's
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
important that some of the answers that
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
you receive from Mr Wheeler were not
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
what I remember about negotiations
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
I first want to say I represent three
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
different bargaining units in Milford a
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
custodial unit that begins work at 6 A.M
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
a paraprofessional unit that begins work
 
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes 7 30 sometimes 8 30 depending
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
on what school they work in and a
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
teacher unit and again they all Begin
 
00:26:39.409 --> 00:26:39.419 align:start position:0%
work between 7 30 and 8 30. the
 
00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
custodial unit would work we would meet
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
with the custodial unit to engage in
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
negotiations from 7 to 9 A.M on many
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
different dates Mr Wheeler never
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
complained about that it was during
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
their work day
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
we met recently with a paraprofessional
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
unit beginning at 8 AM that meeting
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
lasted till 11 A.M Mr Willard did not
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
make any complaints
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
when we decided to engage in
 
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the teachers we
 
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
actually met for at least two hours to
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
discuss States
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
we discussed States from seven to nine
 
00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:19.799 align:start position:0%
as Suzanne had mentioned and as she
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the super majority of the
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
dates were from 7 to 9 A.M
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
we had one day from four to seven and a
 
00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
couple days from one to three
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
in those one to three dates were dates
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
in which the teachers were engaged in
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
Mr Wheeler to my understanding did not
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
present that he felt we
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
um bulldozed him is what I have received
 
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
from his testimony today
 
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
and to agreeing to those dates
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
we provided dates we went through at
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
least 15 or 16 different dates that we
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
offered he and his team went back to
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
their room to discuss it and they came
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
back and agreed to the dates that were
 
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.110 align:start position:0%
back and agreed to the dates that were
there

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
and again the super majority of them
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
were from 7 to 9 A.M
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know why because we mutually agreed
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
which is what the Public Employee Labor
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
Relations Board requires
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
I know that one of uh one of you had a
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
question about did this go to the Public
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
Employee Labor Relations Board and that
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
would usually occur if there was an
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
unfair Labor practice there was no such
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
unfair Labor practice filed nobody
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
presented again from their side that we
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
were not bargaining in good faith
 
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
there's just no reason for this bill to
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
be in place another reason there's no
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
reason for this bill to be in place is
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
because it says unless otherwise
 
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.630 align:start position:0%
because it says unless otherwise
negotiated

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
negotiated
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's the last provision in this bill
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
guess what that is what's happening now
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
this bill really has no purpose if we
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
can all mutually agree and negotiate the
 
00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
dates that we're planning to meet which
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
is always what has occurred since 1976.
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
but I want to get to my um testimony
 
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.110 align:start position:0%
but I want to get to my um testimony
um

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
to say I'm disappointed that you've
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
singled education professionals out to
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
force them to meet prior to 9 A.M and
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
after 6 PM would be an understatement
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
this bill places an undue burden on
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
public employees that are education
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
professionals that is not placed on
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
other public employees the bill is
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
unfair the bill would make negotiating
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
in a school setting impossible
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
especially for Education support
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
professionals who happen to work two or
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
three jobs after work
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge and after many years of
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
negotiations I believe there has only
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
been one person that has so continuously
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the notion that the dates
 
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
and times per negotiations are to be
 
00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:48.059 align:start position:0%
mutually decided that they would request
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
that this bill be created
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
RSA 273a has already been determined to
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
require negotiations dates and times
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
that are mutually agreed the New
 
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Employee Relations
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
Board has made that ruling in case law
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
the law currently requires meeting dates
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
are set by mutual agreement
 
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement has worked to set
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
negotiations dates since the lab was
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
first implemented in 1976.
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
I also want to say that mutual agreement
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
negotiation dates and times have been
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
set prior to 9 A.M sometimes at 1 pm
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes at 6 pm
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
all by mutual agreement all as necessary
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
to complete negotiations in a timely
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
manner and have peaceful labor relations
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
in the school setting
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will as Suzanne explain raise
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding there are a
 
00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys that represent school boards
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
and those attorneys don't normally work
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
at 7 A.M and don't normally work after 6
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
PM they work normal attorney hours which
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
are usually nine to five
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
and requiring them to come and work from
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
seven to nine and then again from 6 pm
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
to God knows when it makes no sense
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
negotiations sometimes take place for
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
two hours sometimes they play take place
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
for four hours but they're usually an
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
all-day process when we are engaged in
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
mediation and when we are engaged in
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
fact finding which are part of RSA 273a
 
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
if it is required that education
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
professionals negotiate prior to 9 A.M
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
and negotiate after 6 PM you've
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
basically cut off their ability to use
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
the process that's currently in place in
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
and Milford and when I began working in
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
Milford in 2012
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
I would negotiate with the
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent and an attorney
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
representing on the school board
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
it was not until 2019 that one School
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
Board member joined us in negotiation
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
this school board member came to the
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
table we mutually agreed on times and
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
dates to meet and we engaged in
 
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.169 align:start position:0%
dates to meet and we engaged in
negotiations

00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
since that time we have always met
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
during the work day especially to engage
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
in Grievances and other things like that
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
we engaged in negotiations with school
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
board members during the work day and at
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
no time have I ever heard other than
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
today that it was an undue burden on one
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
particular School Board member as you
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
know in Milford there are five school
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
board members there are there's one that
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
I know is available during the day she's
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
retired there is a second one that I I
 
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.909 align:start position:0%
retired there is a second one that I I
understand

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
um Works um as a commuter from home he's
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
available during the day never had a
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
problem with him engaging in
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
negotiations during the work day the
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
only person that has ever engaged in a
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
problem is Mr Wheeler no one else I
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
would hate for us to make a Statewide
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
law that that benefits just one person
 
00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
without benefiting the super majority of
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
um there was one statement made that
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
this law is beneficial to the school
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
board member
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 273-a is actually made for the
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
benefit of both labor and management not
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
for one party over the other
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
so again I would ask you to please vote
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate this law
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
I see none uh oh I do see what
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative peruty thank you Mr
 
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.289 align:start position:0%
representative peruty thank you Mr
chairman

chairman
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your testimony um
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
the school board member is newly added
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
in the last few years
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
um does that school board member
 
00:33:48.169 --> 00:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
actually participate in negotiations or
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
they just sit at the table and more or
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
less observe we know that negotiations
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
that I took part of and I was a chief
 
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.470 align:start position:0%
that I took part of and I was a chief
negotiator

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
negotiator
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
I was the only one that spoke and I
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
would get advice from people but they
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
really didn't have input except through
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
me through the chair is that how it is
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
in Milford that is exactly how it works
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
in Milford today
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your testimony if
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
you have a written copy could you get it
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
to the clerk
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
is it possible for me to send it later I
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
wrote all over it that's that's fine
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and as I said that
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
was the last card that I have
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative baroody if you could get
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet for this bill and pass it
 
00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet for this bill and pass it
forward

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of the numbers for
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
assignments online I
 
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
assignments online I
don't

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.550 align:start position:0%
don't
um

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
our res I think our researcher was
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
getting that and she's not here so if we
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
I have the I don't have a a printout of
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
the online sign ins but in terms of the
 
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:11.900 align:start position:0%
physical sign-ins
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
there were five signed in opposed to
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
this bill and two signed in in favor
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
with that we are in recess until
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
10 45 so uh a little more than five
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and we'll pick up with the next
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.849 align:start position:0%
foreign
interesting

00:44:57.849 --> 00:44:57.859 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I see 10 45 on
 
00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
the clock so if we could
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
retake our seats we can get started with
 
00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:13.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
here we go
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
I would like to open the hearing on Bill
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
number 410 and I recognize the prime
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Pearson to
 
00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
for having us here today
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
for the record Representative Steve
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 which
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 410
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
involves something that
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire typically has not really
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
so I'll go over the premise of why this
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
is here
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
what the bill says is that if you're in
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
a municipality that uses
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
that you'll have the your department
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
based on the collective bargaining
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
agreement to go down and pick a superior
 
00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:55.250 align:start position:0%
agreement to go down and pick a superior
candidate

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
which does happen
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then at that point they would go in
 
00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:02.329 align:start position:0%
and then at that point they would go in
order

00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
the purpose of establishing a
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
promotional list
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
is to find your top candidate your most
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
qualified candidate that is why they do
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
ranked promotional lists
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
now the criteria of said promotional
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
lists varies from community community
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
depends on what the
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
Community Values in their people
 
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.390 align:start position:0%
Community Values in their people
specifically

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's not uniform across the state
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
and in most cases it's part of the
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement with
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
whatever your
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
labor forces
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of establishing a
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
our citizens have equal opportunity
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
from the day you're hired you should
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to rise
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
to whatever level you're willing to
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
Aspire to to try to obtain
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
to put your best foot forward
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
and frankly it's in the public interest
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
to have the most qualified people in
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
leadership positions
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
in municipalities and local government
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers pay salaries to have the
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
most qualified people in those positions
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
and the system that we have in place is
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
through a promotional process
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
too often
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
we see people that seem to be out of
 
00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.770 align:start position:0%
we see people that seem to be out of
place

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
and you get that whisper on the side of
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
Hey That's so-and-so's nephew or that so
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
and it's become in my 20 over 20 years
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
now of public service so blatant so
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
common that it's considered accepted
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the way the system is that's
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
the way things go it just happens
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
well that flies in the face of us having
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
we should not be operating our local
 
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.410 align:start position:0%
we should not be operating our local
municipalities

00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
as if we're still under the feudal
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
system of the British Empire
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
just because someone in your family did
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
something does not entitle you to
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
anything your hard work your dedication
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
your willingness to educate yourself
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
that is part of how America works
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
now the thing that was probably most
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
upsetting to me is the folks that I've
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
seen this suffer from this over time
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
that I've talked to about potentially
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
coming up here today
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
one gave me the fact that it was a
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
scheduling conflict
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
but three others said to me there's no
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
way I'm going to come up and testify on
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
this because I am in fear of Retribution
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
of what will happen if I do so
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
I am not in fear of Retribution
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I will speak for this issue without
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the basic premise of this
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
concept is that for too long
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
we've just had the whisper of hey that's
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
his uncle it's his nephew it's his
 
00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.770 align:start position:0%
his uncle it's his nephew it's his
brother-in-law

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
and that that's got to stop
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
so in the sense of what this bill does
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
not do is it doesn't lock things up
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
tight in some states when you have
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
ranked promotional lists that's it
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
and there is a municipality in state in
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
the our state that does have that in
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
their collective bargaining agreement
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
they go in order that's the decision
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
that was negotiated between that labor
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
force and its community
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
but for most
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist they don't have that
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's a varying of of things
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
as to how they make their decisions
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
and it's gotten to the point where you
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
look at this and go well
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
if the if the promotionalist has no
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
relevancy why do you even do it why do
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
you even have a process
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
because it in essence it's a sham you
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
you just kind of do what you want anyway
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
so again not getting to the tightness of
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
of some of the other states this does
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
give the carve out for that Superior
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
candidate that does exist in some cases
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
where a man you know a department head
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
can reach down and say okay yes you you
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
did not necessarily do as well and the
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
system is in the framework that we have
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
with someone else but because you have
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
something that's above and beyond that
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
puts you way over the top we're going to
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
be able to grab you I did not want to
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
lose that ability for a manager to do
 
00:52:50.579 --> 00:52:52.190 align:start position:0%
lose that ability for a manager to do
that

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
but after that Superior candidate has
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
been grabbed
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
in essence the process should allow
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
itself to continue
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
and hence the the language stating
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
that once that occurs you must go in
 
00:53:06.599 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
that once that occurs you must go in
order

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
that is the basic premise of this bill
 
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
I am certainly welcome questions from
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
what any of you on this
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
and we'll see where this goes
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony I
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
do have a couple questions
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
um first of all since I don't have the
 
00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
rest of this section in front of me
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
I want to get clear in my mind does this
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
new letter apply
 
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.829 align:start position:0%
new letter apply
um

00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
does it require that you use rank lists
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
or does it only apply if you're already
 
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:46.460 align:start position:0%
using the rank list it only applies to
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities in
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the language when it defines this
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
does not include the state and it does
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
not include the counties this is just
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
and in the language that uses a ranked
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
list so if you don't use a lot of small
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
communities don't use rank lists at all
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
some have pass fail some are so tiny
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's they look at two guys in the room
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
and go well okay you know this is this
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
is all I have doesn't apply to them at
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
all it just applies to municipalities
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
that go through the process of having a
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
ranked scored promotional list
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you that helps me the
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
second question I have is the language
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
that you can pass over an eligible
 
00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:30.859 align:start position:0%
candidate one time
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
is that intended to apply to the
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
top-ranked candidate only or everyone
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
down the list everyone down the list
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay yep so in essence if you were to
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
promote the first person if it just
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
happened to work out that way then you
 
00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
haven't met any of the criteria you can
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's one time so for for circumstances
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
where they're
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
where they don't where they go in order
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
as as I feel they should it's not it's a
 
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.089 align:start position:0%
as as I feel they should it's not it's a
non-issue

00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
non-issue
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much are there
 
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:05.540 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
my question uh what's the criteria for
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
the ranking uh is it testing job
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
performance uh it varies from Community
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
to community but typically you'll have
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
some sort of a written exam a practical
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
exam uh some sort of of points for
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
seniority in some cases some points for
 
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
your education level things of that
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
nature make up sometimes it involves a
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
an interview is the interview with the
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
department head is scored and it kind of
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
all encompasses itself into a final
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
score that's that's pretty much typical
 
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
across the board it varies a little bit
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
as far as value and stuff and that's
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that's determined
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
between the community and the in the
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
department typically through their
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement thank
 
00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.970 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement thank
you

00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative soucy
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
from someone that knows the system
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
um being on NASA 5 of 29 years served on
 
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
the executive board for 17 years
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
negotiated contracts many contracts and
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
I see the promotional process change
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
many times not to everyone's likings
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
maybe not to my likings
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
but understandably
 
00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.730 align:start position:0%
but understandably
um

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
negotiating fairly and making changes so
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
do you have the opportunity at any time
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
prior to contract negotiations of
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
putting in a contract proposal that
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
would change the way the promotional
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
system in Manchester is changed what
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
um going what it's at because in Nashua
 
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
we put in contract proposals if we don't
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
like something to make changes do you
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity in Manchester to
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
do the same
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
help me out with what you mean by you
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
so like this does their collective
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit have the ability to
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
negotiate terms of their promotional
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
process yes
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
yes they do have you follow up
 
00:57:18.359 --> 00:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
yes they do have you follow up
follow-up

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
have you and your time on Manchester
 
00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.630 align:start position:0%
have you and your time on Manchester
fire

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
ever propose a change to the system
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
because obviously it appears that it's
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
not liked
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming yes okay and has one more
 
00:57:40.849 --> 00:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
one more has any change come about
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
um there have been attempts to make it
 
00:57:44.099 --> 00:57:45.290 align:start position:0%
um there have been attempts to make it
worse

00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
worse
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
by the municipality
 
00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking this isn't specific to
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester but there have
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
been attempts to to basically nullify
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
the entire thing and literally just go
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
the other way it's going the other way
 
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.870 align:start position:0%
the other way it's going the other way
so

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
but this is this is something I've seen
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
not just in the city of Manchester as
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
far as
 
00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
name tags and last names and
 
00:58:16.859 --> 00:58:18.530 align:start position:0%
name tags and last names and
questionable

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
questionable
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
lengths of service for the per you know
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
the positions people hold and things
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
like that that's
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Granger
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
so in line eight nine and ten it talks
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
about collective bargaining agreements
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh does this bill require collective
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining and is it the case that every
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
town in municipality in New Hampshire
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
uses collective bargaining it does not
 
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
require collective bargaining
 
00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
at all but it says that if the if there
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
is criteria used to create a rank list
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
then it's subject to the collective
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement that exists within
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
that Community if you have one but it
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
and just if I may clarify that statement
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
a little bit it's in the section of law
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
273 that applies to collective
 
00:59:15.049 --> 00:59:15.059 align:start position:0%
bargaining so this law would not apply
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
if there isn't a collective bargaining
 
00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.410 align:start position:0%
if there isn't a collective bargaining
process

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
y from the
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh we're in the same Union
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
come from the same fire department
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
worked on the same station in uh in
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh but I
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
I I I'd like your just your sense uh
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
because you've been you've been uh in a
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
situation have been passed by correct
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
I have okay so give me a sense of what
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's like as a as somebody who is on
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
the fire department sure I've had
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
working partners that have gone through
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
that situation I've had people that have
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
just decided to give up
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
because yeah systems rigged I'm just
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
giving up I'm not even going to try
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
anymore and that's that probably is a
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
supervisor to me is more disheartening
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
than anything else when you have someone
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
that has a passion and a desire to serve
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the public who now just throws their
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
hands up because it doesn't matter what
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
I do
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
um we've had I had a working partner who
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
whose situation led to some drastic
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
results I've had folks that I've seen in
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
in various firehouses that have spent
 
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.410 align:start position:0%
in various firehouses that have spent
years

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
at the fire academy years in in college
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
night school doing everything they can
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
to advance themselves
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
simply dismissed because
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
of what I would consider something that
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
was discriminatory
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
rather than based on the merits of of
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
and it's it's completely demoralizing
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
not just to an individual but to an
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
we have in the fire service developed
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
standards for pretty much everything
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
from the boots we wear to the mass that
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
we wear
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
is there a place in anywhere in the
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
system where uh and I do this in my own
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
Peril suggests this foot uh is there is
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
there any uh rationale or reason why we
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
would put a a system for promotions
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
within the within the standards and
 
01:01:37.079 --> 01:01:39.049 align:start position:0%
within the within the standards and
training

01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know different communities value
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
different things they have specific
 
01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.130 align:start position:0%
different things they have specific
needs

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
that they feel are unique perhaps
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
so to to place a a standard within the
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fire standards training
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
with authority in essence to uniform
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that that would be
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
I think you would you you would take
 
01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:08.780 align:start position:0%
away a bit of a community's individual
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
perspective and needs with that and I
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that I would be in
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
favor of such a thing
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
a final question final question
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
when you were uh passed over as a uh as
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
a candidate
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
what was the uh what were you given as
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
criteria for being passed over
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
um in my in my particular case and in
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
others particular case the the section
 
01:02:41.329 --> 01:02:41.339 align:start position:0%
of the collective bargaining agreement
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:47.329 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know the administrator has the right
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
to blah blah there was never feedback
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
there was never any sort of this is why
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
there none of that it's they just quoted
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
out of uh out of a collective bargaining
 
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.530 align:start position:0%
out of uh out of a collective bargaining
agreement

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
um as to the justification of what what
 
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:03.950 align:start position:0%
um as to the justification of what what
occurred

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
which I don't I don't think is I mean
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's a whole nother issue but I think
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's certainly not beneficial to
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
developing your people when that's the
 
01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
answer that's provided to someone
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Walter
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
represented babyloni
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so you're
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
looking to redefine
 
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
Public Employee
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
specifically for a city or a town
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
and a public we Define a public employer
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
in this sub paragraph
 
01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.230 align:start position:0%
in this sub paragraph
only

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm reading
 
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
on line 10. in this subparagraph only
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that was to make it clear
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
who the players are in this case that
 
01:03:57.530 --> 01:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't redefine the term in statute
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
and just in this sub paragraph it clear
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
it's a clarification it's not a
 
01:04:05.339 --> 01:04:08.349 align:start position:0%
it's a clarification it's not a
redefinition

01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
under Title 9 11 of the definitions in
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
273 a which is this is part of terms and
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
conditions of employment so you're
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
looking to redefine the terms and
 
01:04:22.329 --> 01:04:22.339 align:start position:0%
conditions of a public employer to
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
overrule their organizational structure
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'll clarify that for me because
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
this is telling you you can only
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
which if we passed it uh shall only one
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
time in the life of the promotionalist
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
so if you have a 30-year employee that's
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
been passed over once
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
a promotionalist five years ago and it's
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
not still not ready for a
 
01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's not how that works so promotional
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
lists have a life span to them anywhere
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
from a year two years three years and
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
then they hold a subsequent
 
01:04:58.079 --> 01:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
then they hold a subsequent
um

01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
exam that they're not lifetime lists it
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
that would also hold true if you changed
 
01:05:04.559 --> 01:05:06.530 align:start position:0%
that would also hold true if you changed
administrators

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
so if you change an administrator that
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
starts so it resets as well because you
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
have a new administrator who has a
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
different potentially set of of
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
priorities in their criteria so
 
01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:20.690 align:start position:0%
priorities in their criteria so
um

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
this is not an infinite
 
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.549 align:start position:0%
this is not an infinite
circumstance

01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
it it expires when the list expires oh
 
01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.309 align:start position:0%
it it expires when the list expires oh
well

01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and I know there's been talk of fire
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
and police have you given thought to
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
like DPW departments or anything like
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
that that sure might have a promotional
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
again if they don't have a a
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement this
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
this is not applicable to them because
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
it's it it references that it must again
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
in the beginning part where
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
um it mentions that the criteria shall
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
be subject to the collective bargain
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
agreement in effect at the time if they
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't have a collective bargaining
 
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
agreement it's it's irrelevant if they
 
01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:15.299 align:start position:0%
if they don't use a promotional process
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
that ranks or scores if they have a pass
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
fail as an example this is not relevant
 
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
to that because you you don't you can't
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
rank pass fail
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
clarification representative thank you
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure um
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
reading this and how it changes how the
 
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:39.380 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
promotion list would be used
 
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:44.579 align:start position:0%
could the same thing that this is this
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to accomplish be
 
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
accomplished on a municipality by
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
municipality level by putting it into
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bargain contract
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
so what happens is as you guys are well
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
aware being this is the labor committee
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
you have a process of back and forth
 
01:07:03.299 --> 01:07:05.690 align:start position:0%
you have a process of back and forth
and

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
you do not have the ability you you know
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that are
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
brought to the table there are certain
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
things that are immediately off the
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
table on both sides
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
and to to ask in an administrator or a
 
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
department head to
 
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.589 align:start position:0%
department head to
um

01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
rare you know is rarely successful so
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the sense of you
 
01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:35.690 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the sense of you
know

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.130 align:start position:0%
know
as

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
as in is it the purpose of a republic is
 
01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.569 align:start position:0%
as in is it the purpose of a republic is
to

01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:42.410 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
basically stand for the minority stand
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
for the those that are
 
01:07:48.119 --> 01:07:49.130 align:start position:0%
for the those that are
um

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
that don't necessarily have the power
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
and might to stand and force things that
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
that is the function of this is to
 
01:07:59.809 --> 01:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
to say in New Hampshire
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary discriminatory decision making
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
in a promotional process when we have a
 
01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
set of criteria that is established that
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
puts you in a ranking order based on
 
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:19.370 align:start position:0%
puts you in a ranking order based on
qualifications

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
let me ask representative Cahill first
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
and then I'll come to you
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh you mentioned that they often
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
use an interview which I think is
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
subjective is that is that something
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
that could be used to manipulate the uh
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the list even if you
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
didn't have this the it would depend
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
certainly on the weight that is that is
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
provided to that interview
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
as far as you know when you're when
 
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
you're typically using a point structure
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
right to create a ranked list the value
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
of that interview
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
in reference to other parts is a
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
negotiated item
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
that also allows the circumstance where
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
a department head
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
has to deal with a candidate who is an
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
excellent test taker but yet lacks
 
01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
excellent test taker but yet lacks
certain

01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
either character criteria or just you
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
know the ability to to lead that where
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
that can be taken
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
and balanced out so I I would you know I
 
01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.329 align:start position:0%
and balanced out so I I would you know I
don't

01:09:29.329 --> 01:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not advocating to remove any sort of
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
of criteria used to establish a list
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
that is between the the collective
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit in it in its
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
municipality so I don't want to
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
interfere with that that's that's their
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
decision what I'm saying is once they
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
set the rules
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
and everybody agrees to whatever those
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
rules are
 
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.930 align:start position:0%
rules are
then

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
you've established your promotional list
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
use it and use it in order
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so you would give
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
them one bite at the Apple to uh change
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
to use different to avoid the criteria
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
and following that they would follow the
 
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
criser rate and it would depend on the
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement in some
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities their collective
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement says they go in
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
order and some says that they can choose
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
out of the top three candidates and
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's typically done because the scores
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
may be really close together and it's
 
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used to grab a superior
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
candidate that has things that don't
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily fit within the framework of
 
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
the rigid
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
point system that is a that exists that
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of it and I don't
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
necess I don't want to take that ability
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
away for for them to do that but I'm
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
saying that if you have a superior
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
candidate then you get one shot at the
 
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
superior candidate and then you're going
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
to have to go in order thank you
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Susie
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
so the bargaining unit
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
has your opportunity
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
I would assume
 
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.450 align:start position:0%
I would assume
to

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
the negotiation process to hold up
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
something if they felt that the
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
promotional process was a very vital
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
thing to the membership
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
if they didn't like what they saw or
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
what's in the current contract they
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
could actually hold up
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
that negotiations until either side
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
gives or they move on to something else
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
they could sure any any criteria in a
 
01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
collective bargain agreement can end
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
negotiations sure
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
um as far as a collective bargaining uh
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
unit goes uh are all members so say ufia
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
Department the members of One collective
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit or uh lieutenants have
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
their own little one and the captains uh
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
they are not in this particular case and
 
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
also too remember under the Janus
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
decision you are not required
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
to be in a labor union
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
so you have the right to
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
to not participate in that
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
that's that's not just that's a whole
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
country under the Janus decision so
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
at that point who how do we who speaks
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.250 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the rank and file is made up more of
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
um in in your case uh vitamin okay and
 
01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:53.100 align:start position:0%

representative love and I'm not gonna

I'm not gonna speak to that that's
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's a hypothetical that I
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to codify well I've I've
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
had personal experience with
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%

representative do you have a follow-up
question

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
question

um no that's okay thank you
 
01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:37.219 align:start position:0%

01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
uh at some point in your testimony
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh you you referred to uh what I think
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
is a serious matter which is
 
01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:50.570 align:start position:0%
is a serious matter which is
discriminatory

01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
um practices am I accurate in saying
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
that you refer to that at some point
 
01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
during the course of this and if you if
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
you did could you
 
01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.169 align:start position:0%
you did could you
um

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
we've collected buying environments and
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
we have all of those things that can
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
take place and you mentioned
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices can you expand
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
I can give you one in particular because
 
01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:16.490 align:start position:0%
I can give you one in particular because
the

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
turn it on again try it again nope
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
wow all right um maybe if I speak a
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
little bit away from it that might be
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
more helpful uh in in one particular
 
01:14:31.980 --> 01:15:20.350 align:start position:0%
more helpful uh in in one particular
case

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative amelani
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work there it is
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
um if your municipality has a ordinance
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
that has a structure in place
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
and it's not subject to bargaining would
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
this overrule those ordinances or
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying in their coordinates a
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that it would because
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's not afflict of carbony
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
function do you have an example of a
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
community that has their promotional
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
profits in their ordinances I'm looking
 
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.570 align:start position:0%
profits in their ordinances I'm looking
at

01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:10.580 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%

provisions of this chapter are you
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking to rewrite that with this or
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
change it
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
probably not it's very specific to
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
Collective bargain and I'd love to I'd
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%

promotions
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
it does enable them but actually I'd
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
just be surprised to hear that because
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
I've never heard that
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
if that's still distorted we might want
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%

smigula I'm a lifelong resident of the

State of New Hampshire and
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
um 26 plus year police officer for the
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
city at Concord
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
currently hold the rank of uh deputy
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
chief so a fair and Equitable
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
promotional process it mean a lot to me
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
I've been through many of them I've been
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
successful in some of them
 
01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:34.729 align:start position:0%
successful in some of them
um

01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:36.649 --> 01:19:36.659 align:start position:0%
concerned with the language as written
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
the reason why I posed this is Concord
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
is one of those committees or excuse me
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
promotional process governed by
 
01:19:47.159 --> 01:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
promotional process governed by
ordinance

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
so I was concerned coming in here uh the
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
impact I've made that uh you know this
 
01:19:57.530 --> 01:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
would not impact the way we do
 
01:20:00.169 --> 01:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
operations in Concord because
 
01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:02.540 align:start position:0%
obtained solely in a CBA
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
but I do have concerns that while we do
 
01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:08.300 align:start position:0%
have our guidance from city ordinance
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
cbas change all the time we just closed
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
our last uh
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
um and I guess uh what I really uh
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
oppose is it seems to me that if you
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
pass somebody over in in Concord we we
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
have the ability by ordinance pick from
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
anyone in the top three and and we're
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
trying to get our best candidates in the
 
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
in the right positions uh to to benefit
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
the organization
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh we also have uh the public Integrity
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
unit which is new to the state and for
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
police officers uh while this is
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
uncommon I can certainly Envision during
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
the time where a promotional process
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
kicks off and you have a ranking and and
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
the time in which you're actually moving
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
to fill that vacancy to to promote
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
somebody that uh what would we do if
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
something came up and you got notified
 
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
as a department that one of your top
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
three were under investigation by the
 
01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:15.620 align:start position:0%
AGS for an alleged act
 
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:18.260 align:start position:0%
what would you do you'd pass them over
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh and that would automatically mean the
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
next time you do a promotion within the
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
life of that promotion you would have to
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
promote them what happens if you didn't
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
have a response back from the AGS this
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
is a real occurrence it does happen
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know without getting into uh
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
specifics I have an officer out on leave
 
01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh and it's his fourth month and we're
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
waiting for uh some sort of guidance
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
from them and and I can't help but think
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
what would I do if this was relevant to
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
to the city of Concord and uh we
 
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
promoted two people in that four-month
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
time period which at our rate of
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
turnover is very possible and would we
 
01:21:59.209 --> 01:21:59.219 align:start position:0%
be in a position where we would have to
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
make that promotion
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
uh and then God forbid you'll learn
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
something afterwards where you'd have to
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh deal with that as an internal matter
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
in in demote or something like that I
 
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
just think uh the overall intent might
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
be uh uh Noble but I think there's a lot
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
of facets here that need to be thought
 
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
about and how it impacts other agencies
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.310 align:start position:0%
taking the question
um

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
relating back you spoke about an
 
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
ordinance that you have to select your
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
top three yes sir so there was an
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance already in place for your
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
promotional process in certain instances
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
so this is worth
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
Chief thanks for the uh coming today and
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
providing a testimony
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
so Mike my question is uh centered
 
01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
around the whole question of of um
 
01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
of somebody being passed over without
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
good without just cause and could you
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
explain what your process is when you
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
make a selection and how you document
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
your decisions
 
01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
sure our selections are are the end
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
result of a rigorous process
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
we have a written test we have
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
interviews and then there's a component
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
for things like experience and and
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
Longevity so that we're making sure that
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
the folks that we're promoting uh have
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
the work experience that we're setting
 
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
them up for success
 
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.450 align:start position:0%
them up for success
um

01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
we end up inviting folks from the
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
community to participate in our
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
promotion process as well we take all
 
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:00.860 align:start position:0%
that input and it gets referred back to
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
the department head so in the police
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
department that would be the chief of
 
01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.169 align:start position:0%
department that would be the chief of
police

01:24:05.169 --> 01:24:05.179 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
and then those movements are made based
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
on a ranking so a roster is produced
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
it's all numerically based and uh he has
 
01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
the the latitude to pick from that top
 
01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:19.450 align:start position:0%
the the latitude to pick from that top
three

01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
all right follow up thank you
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
so for for a candidate who is in the top
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
three and gets passed over
 
01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:29.330 align:start position:0%
three and gets passed over
uh

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
how were they uh able to look at what
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
that process was and understand why it
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
is that they were passed over subjective
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
objective kind of environment
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
so all our process uh you know there are
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
score sheets there are Raider reports
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing uh any any candidate
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
in a process can go back up to our
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
professional development unit and get
 
01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
full disclosure of those notes the
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
selections they they know the the whole
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
list and and that affords a great uh
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity for uh the lieutenant in
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
charge of our professional development
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
unit to actually touch upon reasons why
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh they were passed over maybe it was a
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
Personnel issue and there wasn't enough
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
time and distance between the uh the
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
closure of that Personnel issue and the
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
timing of a promotion you know um and
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
and like I said I've put in for many
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
promotions and been successful in some
 
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate not you know getting uh
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
What uh what you had wanted
 
01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:28.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%

chair for taking my question
 
01:25:33.179 --> 01:25:33.890 align:start position:0%
chair for taking my question
um

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
do you have in your criteria
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
for your ranking do you have an
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
affirmative action criteria that you
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
also use that may actually
 
01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:44.750 align:start position:0%
also use that may actually
um

01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
rise above maybe where somebody is
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
are you referring to like a waiting
 
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.669 align:start position:0%
are you referring to like a waiting
um

01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:55.679 --> 01:25:58.129 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean is there is there a
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that needs to meet the
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
affirmative action
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
um where you have so many people in that
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
in that category that need to be
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
promoted or should be promoted above
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else who has scored
 
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.350 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else who has scored
higher

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:26:15.290 --> 01:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh the best example I can use and sorry
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this personal
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
um when my husband was taking the test
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
for the State Police in Massachusetts he
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
scored a 98 plus but was passed over by
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who scored in the low 80s
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
because they had to meet an affirmative
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
action criteria so I'm just curious if
 
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
that is something that's part of the
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
criteria that you're working with here
 
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire no it's not
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%

01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
um do you often advertise outside of
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
your department for certain positions
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh we do and would they follow please
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you my apologies
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
um would they be part of that ranking
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
process even though you might have
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
officers in place that might be
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
qualified for that job
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%

01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I represent the New Hampshire
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police and we
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
are in oppositioning this bill HP 410
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
now you can only speak quite frankly to
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
police matters as far as this issue is
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
concerned but I think it might be
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
applicable to other uh professions as
 
01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.510 align:start position:0%
applicable to other uh professions as
well

01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a little bit of my
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
pedigree and my history because I think
 
01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
it's important here
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
I've been a police officer for over 43
 
01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.729 align:start position:0%
I've been a police officer for over 43
years

01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
if you include my part-time work it's
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
been 45 years
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
I've been passed over so many times I
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
like to tell people I got athlete Scout
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
I may I heard someone mention academic
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
requirements I have a bachelor's degree
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
two master's degrees and a PhD
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
and I have soon been passed over for
 
01:28:55.139 --> 01:28:57.290 align:start position:0%
and I have soon been passed over for
promotion

01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
promotion
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
I've been a police chief all toll for 19
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
years the first five
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
um first five of those 19 was for the
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
town of Winthrop Massachusetts
 
01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
the last 14 years have been in the city
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
of Franklin
 
01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
I started my career back in 1979 full
 
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.270 align:start position:0%
I started my career back in 1979 full
time

01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
worked for the Derry Police Department
 
01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
for three years went to the state police
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
for the next 23 years where I retired as
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
a uniform captain
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
took that five-year Hiatus went down to
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as chief where I'm from
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
and came back uh lovingly so to New
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never gave up my New Hampshire
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
address by the way and uh have been in
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
we have to look at this a little bit
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
differently from our perspective while
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester might be the largest city in
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
the state Franklin is the smallest of
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
the 13 cities and yet we still have some
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
of the similar issues that we're
 
01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
I don't understand a little bit as to
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
why this is just City and towns
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
as a trooper as a member of the state
 
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.129 align:start position:0%
as a trooper as a member of the state
police

01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
I was passed over many times uh until I
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
finally made rank
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I would think that this would be
 
01:30:12.729 --> 01:30:12.739 align:start position:0%
applicable to both state and County
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the Civil when I was in Massachusetts
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
we dealt with something called civil
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
service and I'm going to bring that up
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
because my fear
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
my abject fear is that we are going to
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
become a Massachusetts and I ask you not
 
01:30:32.570 --> 01:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts when I was Chief there
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
we had Civil Service I had no choice
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
it was promote the first person on the
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
list that was uh that the uh it tests uh
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
resulted in however there were
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
Exceptions there were as you put it
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
affirmative action Exceptions there were
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
disability Exceptions there were
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
veterans exceptions and it was something
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
that is lovingly referred to in
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as the layoff list
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the layout list is if I laid off an
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
officer and some of them chose to do
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
that they could then apply to another
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
civil service department and they
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
immediately went to the top of the list
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
over everybody else irrespective of
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
their abilities and capabilities we
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't want that
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
at that time my department was under a
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
20-year consent decree because of
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
minority issues and affirmative action
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
issues that we were experiencing the
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
consent decree had been signed by a
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
former Chief who had absolutely no legal
 
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
right to do so but because it had been
 
01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
in place so long it took on the the
 
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
position of being a law
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
it took me three years to show civil
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
service that my department in its
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
minority makeup actually needed that of
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
but it took me three years to do that
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
at first as I said the um in order to
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
get promoted you had to be first on the
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
list some of the other exceptions
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
noteworthy as well however then they
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
went to the top three and my question at
 
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
that point in time was why top three
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
so if I like a but not b and I kind of
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
like C I can then choose among three so
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's kind of this the same thing that's
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
a failure system was known for promoting
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
people that shouldn't have been promoted
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
because they were good test takers but
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
were they good cops that was the problem
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
it was no measure for their ability as
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
police officers there was a great
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
measure for their ability to take a test
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
and trust me I've taken a lot of tests
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
in my time
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
when I wanted finally to promote from
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
Patrol the sergeant I called civil
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
service and I said
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
how do I do that oh we don't have a
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
process for that
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I was very concerned and I said what
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
do I do and they said make one up sure I
 
01:32:50.159 --> 01:32:50.810 align:start position:0%
do I do and they said make one up sure I
did

01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they went up that was numerically
 
01:32:55.129 --> 01:32:55.139 align:start position:0%
based and I was able to promote a
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
sergeant from that particular list
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
I should say she will make it possible
 
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
for a department to abandon objective
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
criteria as well and I would mention
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
this while my department is not clear
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
nor State accredited while State
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
accredited we will be applying for State
 
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
accreditation I was reminded by Chiefs
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
who are Kalia and Kalia stands for the
 
01:33:21.890 --> 01:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
commission on accreditation for law
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies that should this
 
01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:27.860 align:start position:0%
become law that undermines Kalia
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirements in other words uh as I was
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
told we have to consider the fact that
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
both federal and state standards for
 
01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
accreditation container requirements for
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
the promotional process itself must use
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
performance reviews for Kalia and state
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
accreditation and this uh this is a good
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
test you might have a good test taker
 
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:49.139 align:start position:0%
but not a great talk as I mentioned
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
something to keep in mind as well
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation presumes on the
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
objective processes when any good
 
01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
promotional process does involve
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
subjective criteria the department it
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
has to be allowed to use his or her good
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
judgment good sense to make a final
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
decision vis-a-vis the best employee for
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
promotion for that particular Department
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
should this become law I can assure you
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
the Departments without Collective
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
borrowing agreement guidelines will shy
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
away and from those with Collective
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
burning agreements and the guidelines
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
will not be the same
 
01:34:25.129 --> 01:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
on his face
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
this is not a Despicable concept it
 
01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
means a lot to people but in practice a
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
diminution of the ability
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
for those in command to establish the
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
best department they know how we know
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
we know our communities you know the
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
people that can best serve our
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
communities and contrary to popular
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
belief I can and as I said can only
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
speak to police departments we're not a
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
democracy we're still in autocracy in a
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
police department
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
we are of necessity that way
 
01:34:58.850 --> 01:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
is there a possible solution
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh is this a possible solution in search
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
of a problem that's the question that I
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
have to ask thank you for listening and
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to entertain any questions
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
you might have thank you for your
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
testimony are there questions
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
representative valwani
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:20.900 align:start position:0%
um the city of Concord has ordinances
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
pertaining to promotionalists it and not
 
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
asking you for all of the towns that you
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
represent but do you know of any others
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
that might have that ordinance in place
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
I do not thank you
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.209 --> 01:35:46.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you just don't call me late for
 
01:35:49.020 --> 01:36:01.970 align:start position:0%
thank you just don't call me late for
lunch

01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
can you talk about
 
01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
can you talk about
um

01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
and knowing you're sitting me
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and quite
 
01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.649 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and quite
frankly

01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of different ways
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
to approach that and that is on a more
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
personal level that we would do
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
something like that so if a candidate
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
came to me and they have and said why
 
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
didn't I get promoted we would talk a
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
little bit about that and it might be as
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
I said anything could be performance
 
01:36:38.689 --> 01:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
review issue could be disciplinary
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
issues in the past it could just be that
 
01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:45.620 align:start position:0%
they just didn't show uh what I consider
 
01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:48.260 align:start position:0%
uh the necessary
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
aspects we need in order to take on that
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
particular role
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
um it's not a perfect system by any
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
stretch on either side it wouldn't be a
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
perfect system if you if you voted this
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
into law it's not a perfect system on
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
the subjective side I'm sure everybody
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
in this room who's worked in any kind of
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
hierarchical environment has been passed
 
01:37:10.669 --> 01:37:10.679 align:start position:0%
over for a position or has wanted
 
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
something and not got it so it hurts
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's no question as I said I've been
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
passed over as the deputy said many
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
times times quite frankly and sometimes
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
scratched my head and went home and when
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
I was alone screamed into the pillow but
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
other than that uh that that also is a
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
fact of life that we have to live by at
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
this point in time we can't legislate
 
01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.610 align:start position:0%
this point in time we can't legislate
this

01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
they can't legislate this you can't
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
legislate human dealings and and
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
emotions it just doesn't work so the
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
best approach that I've used in the past
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
is let's sit down and talk about it
 
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
because I do have an open door policy
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
I see none so thank you very much for
 
01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I have one
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
final card for this bill
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
um if there's anybody else who hasn't
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
filled out a card please do so this is
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
natch Grace he is representing New
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
opposes the Bill thank you Mr chair and
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
H Grace from Municipal Association as
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
stated I opposed the bill
 
01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
um the the officers ahead of me said
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
most everything I wanted to say so be
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
very brief
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I've heard from my my members uh
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
several of them that they're very
 
01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
concerned that if passed this would
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
essentially require them to either keep
 
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
open a position that they're looking to
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
promote someone into or fill it with an
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
unsuitable candidate that the specific
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
examples that I was provided related to
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
someone who is potentially under
 
01:38:46.450 --> 01:38:46.460 align:start position:0%
investigation by the AG's office
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
obviously we all know what the headline
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
would be if they were promoted
 
01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
and if the AG's office came down and
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
said that uh you know they found some
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
sort of wrongdoing there
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
um and municipalities don't want to be
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
in that position they want the ability
 
01:39:05.209 --> 01:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
to uh to to avoid that uh headline in
 
01:39:05.219 --> 01:39:07.189 align:start position:0%
to uh to to avoid that uh headline in
WMUR

01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
WMUR
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and the other example that I was
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
specifically given was there are
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
situations where employees come forward
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
they say to their employers you know I'm
 
01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
having uh mental health issues can you
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
work with me the employer works with
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
them but they may be on this
 
01:39:24.649 --> 01:39:24.659 align:start position:0%
pre-existing list and it would be unfair
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
to them and unfair to the employer to
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
put them in a new situation at that time
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
simply because that would cause new
 
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.950 align:start position:0%
simply because that would cause new
stressors

01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
stressors
 
01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and that would not necessarily work
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
out for everyone involved so those were
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the two major concerns and I won't
 
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
repeat everything that the officer said
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
ahead of me because I think they covered
 
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
basically everything else
 
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that testimony I
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
have a question there was a a question
 
01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:50.570 align:start position:0%
have a question there was a a question
earlier

01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.250 align:start position:0%
earlier
about

01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
we've heard about police and fire how
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
might this affect differently other
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
departments within a city in town could
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
it impact schools does that fit in the
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
definition are there other issues that
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
might be outside of police and fire yes
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
so my understandings would affect
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere where there is a collective
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement I don't have a
 
01:40:17.450 --> 01:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list of every Department
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
that that might be collectively
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
bargaining although the state obviously
 
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:21.890 align:start position:0%
bargaining although the state obviously
does

01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
um but there are Public Works
 
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
departments that that are have collected
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements there are schools
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
that obviously their teacher collective
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements I don't represent
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
teachers so I don't I don't follow that
 
01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
closely but they those do exist
 
01:40:37.729 --> 01:40:37.739 align:start position:0%
um so there are other departments and
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
there are some municipalities I believe
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
that the administrators uh so kind of
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
the front office staff are also
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
unionized as well
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
we to my knowledge we haven't done so
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
recently uh but that's a good suggestion
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
and I'll make that as soon as I get back
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
to the office and if if we can find
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
something I'll let you know
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%

01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we heard that the city of Concord has
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
an ordinance regarding promotions are
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%

01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh in either police fire context or
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
other contexts that specify that by
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
ordinance I knew someone was going to
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
ask me that and I should have said in
 
01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
the beginning I don't have an answer for
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%

close the hearing on 410. I'll hold off
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet until we are a little
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
bit behind so I'd like to open the

01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce and school accommodations for
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
those with long-term covid and mecfs
 
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
as a little bit of background one of my
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
degrees is in medical biology and I
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
worked for years as a clinical
 
01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.709 align:start position:0%
worked for years as a clinical
microbiologist

01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
microbiologist
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
long covid is often a debilitating
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
illness that occurs in at least 10 and
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
as much as 30 percent of covid
 
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
infections more than 200 symptoms have
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
been identified with impacts on multiple
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
organ systems at least 65 million
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
individuals worldwide are estimated to
 
01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
have long covid with CR with cases
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
increasing daily the article that I just
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
sent you it's a technical article but if
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
you turn to page three which has the
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
graphic you can see some of the symptoms
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
that are associated with long covid
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
some of them obviously very debilitating
 
01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:07.460 align:start position:0%
uh myalgic
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
encephalomyelitis is uh is also also
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
called chronic fatigue syndrome or mecfs
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
is a long-term viral-induced condition
 
01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
with a wide range of symptoms the most
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
common symptom is extreme tiredness
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
other common symptoms include muscle
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
pain pain in the joints headaches sore
 
01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:31.100 align:start position:0%
throat gastrointestinal system symptoms
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to light chills visual
 
01:44:36.890 --> 01:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
disturbances nausea and allergies you'll
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
notice that there are a lot of
 
01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:39.169 align:start position:0%
notice that there are a lot of
similarities

01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
similarities
 
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
we are not quite sure of the mechanism
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
but it's looking like some viruses
 
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
remain in people's bodies creating havoc
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
in the case of children we are going to
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
see behavioral disorders cognitive
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
issues and very real body issues many of
 
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
these children will need special
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
education services with accommodations
 
01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
to allow them to stay in school
 
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
some children may need remote access to
 
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
school we are going to need to be
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
creative on what we can do to protect
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
these kids and give them every
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity they can every opportunity
 
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
to stay in school
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
adults are also seeing these symptoms
 
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
and are are going to see similar health
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
issues that will impact their ability to
 
01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:23.510 align:start position:0%
issues that will impact their ability to
work

01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
in a recent presentation to the Nashua
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce and I sent everyone
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
a copy of this presentation by email
 
01:45:33.370 --> 01:45:33.380 align:start position:0%
The Economist that gave the presentation
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
did not think we are heading into a
 
01:45:37.729 --> 01:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
recession but he does have concerns
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
about the workforce and if you look at
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
slide 11 on the presentation which
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can see it but this
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
is basically there's just a downtrend
 
01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:49.430 align:start position:0%
is basically there's just a downtrend
um

01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
his concern is about the workforce our
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
state's biggest challenge to growth is
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
our labor force it's recovering but it
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
remains below pre a pandemic of numbers
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
when I specifically asked him about uh
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
why the numbers were depressed in New
 
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he gave a few reasons one is
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
um he the social media influencers are
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
not being recorded as working he also
 
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
said that women have left the force in
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
large numbers to take care of their
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
children who have been sick and he also
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
said that because some people have
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
gotten long coveted and have become
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
debilitated that they have been removed
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
from our Workforce
 
01:46:38.410 --> 01:46:38.420 align:start position:0%
uh simply put we need more workers
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
employees with long coveted mecfs
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
employees may need legal protections and
 
01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.830 align:start position:0%
employees may need legal protections and
accommodations

01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
it may be that they are part-time
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
workers or that they need a chair to sit
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
in while they're doing their work or
 
01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
they may need time to nap if we want
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
these workers to contribute to the
 
01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
workforce again
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
once again we're going to have to be
 
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.649 align:start position:0%
once again we're going to have to be
creative

01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
creative
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
some questions that we can consider what
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
limitations is the student or employee
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
experiencing how do these limitations
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
affect the employee and the employee's
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
job performance or the students school
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
performance and what specific tasks are
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
problematic as a result of these
 
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
problematic as a result of these
limitations

01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the email that I sent you I also
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
um there there was a link to a website
 
01:47:28.010 --> 01:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
for mecfs and at the bottom of the link
 
01:47:31.209 --> 01:47:31.219 align:start position:0%
there are uh examples of accommodations
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
for many of the symptoms that that show
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
so people are working on this issue
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
around the United States this is a new
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
problem and it's a big problem this bill
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
proposes a study committee so that we
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
can hear from patients Physicians
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
employees employers and even teachers
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
the goal is to see if we can provide any
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislative solutions to keep those with
 
01:48:00.169 --> 01:48:00.179 align:start position:0%
long covid and macfss CFS in the
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
workforce and in schools thank you and
 
01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:05.219 align:start position:0%

01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
testimony that's written as the clerk
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to request it
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
would you believe you're the first
 
01:48:31.090 --> 01:48:31.100 align:start position:0%
person to make the connection between
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
covid and the impact on our Workforce in
 
01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
the state house that I know of well I
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
hope I'm not the last
 
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
question so why just on the surface I
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
realize you're you're build just is
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
asking for a study committee
 
01:48:51.410 --> 01:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
um but on the surface why wouldn't
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
existing laws around
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
um disability and impairment at work
 
01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:59.810 align:start position:0%
um disability and impairment at work
cover

01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
the concerns that you've raised
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
um there's a few answers to that one is
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
this is a new problem and we're not we
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the numbers that we're
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing um in the past
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
um secondly
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
testing and everything it's difficult to
 
01:49:22.850 --> 01:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
identify to to completely diagnose
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
someone as having long covet we're still
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.310 align:start position:0%
working on that
um

01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'll use myself as an example I got
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
coveted in 2020 and suffered ill effects
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
for the next two years
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
there was no test to to prove that I had
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
had covid because I had covid prior to
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
um the the testing that was available
 
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
I've since had antibody testing which
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
has proven that I've been exposed to it
 
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
I I think you're heading in the right
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
direction there should be disability
 
01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.530 align:start position:0%
direction there should be disability
um

01:49:59.530 --> 01:49:59.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
protections but I think it's going to be
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
difficult accessing those protections
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.490 --> 01:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you if you wish to speak make sure
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
and you can do it you can speak first
 
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
but make sure you fill out a pink card
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
for the record now
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
please do
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
just tell us your name and who you're
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
representing yeah and hi I'm a little
 
01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:40.129 align:start position:0%
representing yeah and hi I'm a little
nervous

01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:40.139 align:start position:0%
nervous
 
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
um my name is Michelle Roy and I am here
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
along with Wendy to represent the
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
population of people dealing with long
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
covid and other post-viral chronic
 
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
illnesses such as mecfs
 
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
which I have and I would like to state
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
that in regards to this particular study
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
this would have been hugely helpful for
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
me to stay in the workforce
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
I tried to stay in the workforce as long
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
as possible I had to leave my career and
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
keep stepping down and stepping down and
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
trying to find other work solutions that
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
I could continue to make a living
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.209 align:start position:0%
I could continue to make a living
through

01:51:20.209 --> 01:51:20.219 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:51:22.850 --> 01:51:22.860 align:start position:0%
ultimately I reached out to a group
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
called the job accommodation Network who
 
01:51:28.609 --> 01:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
sent me a group excuse me who sent me
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
literature on a a group of um
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
companies that were supposed to have uh
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
Pro disability
 
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.790 align:start position:0%
Pro disability
dogmas

01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
dogmas
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
one of those companies I ended up
 
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
applying to to see if I could benefit
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
from their
 
01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.149 align:start position:0%
from their
their

01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
sorry I have cognitive enthusiasms as
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
witnessed if I could if I could benefit
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:51:57.239 --> 01:51:57.830 align:start position:0%
from there
um

01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:00.980 align:start position:0%
give me a minute from their programs
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
upon meeting
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
the people at a head
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
um they said hey we think you'd be great
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
for a position here we understand you
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
have limitations we would be happy to
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
work around them as we are a non-profit
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
who deals with getting and keeping
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities work
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
um a year in a year and two months in
 
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
I could no longer keep up cognitively
 
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:30.860 align:start position:0%
and sometimes physically
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
and so I was forced to resign if if this
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
study had been done years earlier I
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
believe that myself and millions of
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
other people who suffer from Lim from
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
limitating chronic illnesses could still
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
be in the workplace
 
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
I was also trying to work because as
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
Wendy mentioned
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
there is no buyer marker biomarkers
 
01:52:59.209 --> 01:52:59.219 align:start position:0%
excuse me for for illnesses such as long
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
covid and mecf and other chronic
 
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
illnesses and so we are met with a lot
 
01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:06.350 align:start position:0%
illnesses and so we are met with a lot
of

01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
um speculation even though there are
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
other illnesses such as asthma and and I
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
believe Ms who also do not meet certain
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
biomarker accreditations but are not
 
01:53:18.719 --> 01:53:20.510 align:start position:0%
biomarker accreditations but are not
given

01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.709 align:start position:0%
given
um

01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
the difficult
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
aspects to navigate that we are and so
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of apologize I'm kind of
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
getting off track right now but I for
 
01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.050 align:start position:0%
getting off track right now but I for
one

01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
know that I would still be
 
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
able to contribute financially
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire to the U.S
 
01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:45.659 align:start position:0%
government to my own self
 
01:53:48.490 --> 01:53:48.500 align:start position:0%
if a study like this were to take place
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
and so on behalf of everyone with
 
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
complex chronic issues that have been
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
met with the same challenges that I have
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
I ask you to please take this study into
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
serious consideration I would be very
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and I I am
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%

Concord so I just ask you all please
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
serious consideration
 
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:18.900 align:start position:0%

I see oh representative Schultz hi I
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I think you made your
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
points very clearly so thank you that
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
means a lot to me because a lot of times
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
things are fuzzy so I'm glad it came off
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
somewhat coherent thank you very much I
 
01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you everyone for
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
your time seeing no questions I do not

have any other pink cards and make sure
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
you do get that one up here absolutely
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
um if there is no one else to speak on
 
01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
I would close the hearing for we have a
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
question from representative on this
 
01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.550 align:start position:0%
question from representative on this
paper

01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%

01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
I guess my first question to you if if
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
permissible would be what issues exactly
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
are you asking about whether or not
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen covet issues and people
 
01:56:06.109 --> 01:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
having to be outside of work or having
 
01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
to work remotely or whether we're
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
actually seeing
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
um discriminatory type issues
 
01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:15.890 align:start position:0%
um discriminatory type issues
okay

01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.030 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
we've all I think we've all been
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
affected in one way or another as far as
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
we started in 2020 where we were doing a
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
lot of remote work
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
and then in 2021 it went a little bit
 
01:56:34.850 --> 01:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
more to trying to transition back into
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
the office work as far as obviously the
 
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
state is concerned most of us are in
 
01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:41.830 align:start position:0%
state is concerned most of us are in
office

01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of private employers seem to be
 
01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
remote work and that seems to be working
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge and I am
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
quantifying that as my knowledge uh
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
there does not seem to be a lot of
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
dispute right now between employers and
 
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
employees for those employers who have
 
01:57:04.129 --> 01:57:04.139 align:start position:0%
to work from home whether it's because
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
of a covet exposure or because of a
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
concern with their own health and the
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
potential for a covet exposure so long
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
as it doesn't impact the actual job for
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
instance a lawyer in a law firm's
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
obviously got to attend hearings if it
 
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
is not possible for virtual hearings and
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
they are required to go in person and
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
they cannot
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
then obviously that can negatively
 
01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
impact the job that they're required to
 
01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.169 align:start position:0%
impact the job that they're required to
do

01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
um my own knowledge I have not seen that
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
issue come into play where there hasn't
 
01:57:37.139 --> 01:57:38.270 align:start position:0%
issue come into play where there hasn't
been

01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
a way around it that an employer has
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
used as far as discrimination that I can
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
honestly say from my perspective I have
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
not seen that coming to the Department
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.850 --> 01:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Cahill
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Brown
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
so especially in this tight labor market
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
isn't it likely that employers are going
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
to really Bend as far as they can when
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
someone in the sense I need an
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation of this type or that type
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
if they can do it
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
I think the last part of your phrase is
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually the most important part of the
 
01:58:20.410 --> 01:58:20.420 align:start position:0%
phrase if they can do it
 
01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
there are certain jobs that do require a
 
01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
person to show up at the office or to
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
show up at another location such as the
 
01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:29.810 align:start position:0%
show up at another location such as the
legislature

01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:30.770 align:start position:0%
legislature
um

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
I've seen that a lot of employers are
 
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
working more with employees to get them
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be to increase
 
01:58:42.530 --> 01:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
the the number of employees that they
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
have but it really does come to the last
 
01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.370 --> 01:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz you had a
 
01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.410 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz you had a
question

01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:53.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:56.649 --> 01:58:56.659 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none and again I thank you very
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I have no other request to testify if
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%

01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
clerk I'd appreciate that thank you
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
um so I will close the hearing on HB 561
 
01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative Broody if you could hand
 
01:59:20.089 --> 01:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
up the other blue sheets I don't know if
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
we have any reports for the online
 
01:59:22.619 --> 01:59:25.750 align:start position:0%
we have any reports for the online
signups

01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes please if you could get that for
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
the afternoon and and maybe we can
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh is it it's related to this
 
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:59:52.609 --> 01:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
is it a permitting test
 
01:59:52.619 --> 01:59:54.830 align:start position:0%
is it a permitting test
s

01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%

ask let's talk about it afterwards okay
 
02:00:00.229 --> 02:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
because we are a little behind
 
02:00:00.239 --> 02:00:01.310 align:start position:0%
because we are a little behind
um

02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's I believe there's a paper is
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%

02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:09.420 align:start position:0%

03:09:04.370 --> 03:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
reactions are um
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
things of the past I think we're ready
 
03:09:09.170 --> 03:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
to move forward and um I think the
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
sponsor himself indicated that he was
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
not aware of any situations that this uh
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
bill would actually address so I think
 
03:09:19.010 --> 03:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's a bill that's unneeded in past its
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.130 --> 03:09:25.140 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is representative
 
03:12:38.330 --> 03:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
adjective from Enfield uh my full name
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
is Joshua only adjutant my middle name
 
03:12:43.849 --> 03:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
Ollie comes from my grandfather his name
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
was Ollie F Kenny Jr he died in 1998 so
 
03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
I don't have any living memory of him
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
but through happenstance he and I share
 
03:12:54.530 --> 03:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
one unique thing in common we are both
 
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
fans of the musical stylings of a
 
03:12:59.690 --> 03:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
country singer named Roger Miller
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
most of Roger Miller's biggest hits came
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
out of the 1960s and they reflect that
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
time well
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
I've got about an hour commute down here
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
so I've often thrown on his greatest
 
03:13:10.730 --> 03:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
hits album on the ride a lot of the
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
tracks like do Wackadoo are silly songs
 
03:13:16.130 --> 03:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
that offer little if any historical lens
 
03:13:17.690 --> 03:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
but there's probably his most famous
 
03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
song King of the Road
 
03:13:21.889 --> 03:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
that offers a glimpse into the past with
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
which I look at this bill before us here
 
03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:25.010 align:start position:0%
which I look at this bill before us here
today

03:13:25.010 --> 03:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:13:27.410 --> 03:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
the first verse is as follows trailer
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
for sale or rent rooms to let 50 cents
 
03:13:34.610 --> 03:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
no phone no pool no pets I ain't got no
 
03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:35.630 align:start position:0%
no phone no pool no pets I ain't got no
cigarettes

03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
03:13:38.690 --> 03:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
but two hours of pushing broom buys an 8
 
03:13:40.910 --> 03:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
by 12 4-bit room
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm a man of means by no means King of
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Road
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
this song was written in 1964 when the
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was a dollar and a quarter
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
an hour so Miller pushing a broom for
 
03:13:55.370 --> 03:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
two hours at one time presumably at
 
03:13:57.410 --> 03:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
minimum wage would make two dollars and
 
03:13:59.929 --> 03:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
fifty cents before taxes assuming he
 
03:14:01.010 --> 03:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
paid them
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
that two hours of minimum wage work in
 
03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
1964 was enough to pay for his shelter
 
03:14:09.410 --> 03:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
for five days the 50 Cent 4-bit room
 
03:14:12.349 --> 03:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
let's compare that figure to today
 
03:14:14.570 --> 03:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
a person who works two hours in a day at
 
03:14:17.210 --> 03:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
minimum wage would make 14.50 before
 
03:14:19.969 --> 03:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
taxes an average motel room just for
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
shelter runs over a hundred dollars a
 
03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
shelter runs over a hundred dollars a
night

03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:14:24.050 --> 03:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
forget two hours what about the whole
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
day fifty eight dollars a day before
 
03:14:28.370 --> 03:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
taxes they aren't even halfway to
 
03:14:30.290 --> 03:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
shelter and that's all their money
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
for a full month's work they're at 16 uh
 
03:14:34.670 --> 03:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
at one thousand one hundred and sixty
 
03:14:37.370 --> 03:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
dollars before taxes average rent in the
 
03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is almost two
 
03:14:41.330 --> 03:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars again not even halfway
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
to shelter and all their money is gone
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
one of the big themes of the song King
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the Road is that Miller is a man who
 
03:14:50.090 --> 03:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
only works when he is absolutely forced
 
03:14:50.100 --> 03:14:50.870 align:start position:0%
only works when he is absolutely forced
to

03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
he rides box cars he's a man of means by
 
03:14:56.750 --> 03:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
no means even a person like that in 1964
 
03:14:58.429 --> 03:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
had a minimum wage that ensured they
 
03:14:59.690 --> 03:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
could survive
 
03:15:01.490 --> 03:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
I can say today that our low-wage
 
03:15:02.929 --> 03:15:02.939 align:start position:0%
workers here in New Hampshire do not
 
03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
meet the description of Miller by any
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
means they are hard-working people who
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
through circumstances varying or working
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
low-wage jobs often multiple
 
03:15:13.730 --> 03:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
I took the scenic route to get to this
 
03:15:15.230 --> 03:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
point because in years past I've read
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
off the quotes from presidents who
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
invented the minimum wage and talked
 
03:15:19.370 --> 03:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
about how it was meant to support a
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
decent standard of living and that to
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
this point has not changed a single mind
 
03:15:25.690 --> 03:15:25.700 align:start position:0%
and I do not like recycling words
 
03:15:28.370 --> 03:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
instead I would submit that this Society
 
03:15:30.889 --> 03:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
once existed in a time where the minimum
 
03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
wage may not have given everyone in the
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
world a perfect life but a livable one
 
03:15:37.969 --> 03:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that 15 an hour on its
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
own is going to be enough indeed we do
 
03:15:41.450 --> 03:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
need to tackle commodity prices and
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
markets like housing and Automobiles and
 
03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
I submit that I don't support chasing
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
prices forever near the Setting Sun
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
but I think passing this bill to raise
 
03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour is
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
a good start
 
03:15:54.889 --> 03:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee to reject the
 
03:15:57.170 --> 03:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
itl motion before us and pass this bill
 
03:15:59.570 --> 03:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
outright because to paraphrase Roger
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
Miller you can't roller skate in a
 
03:16:03.530 --> 03:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
buffalo herd and you can't have a decent
 
03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.300 --> 03:16:12.290 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.570 --> 03:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
I will vote against this itl motion uh
 
03:16:21.410 --> 03:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
on 15 minimum wage bill because
 
03:16:23.450 --> 03:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
according to the economic policy
 
03:16:23.460 --> 03:16:24.650 align:start position:0%
according to the economic policy
Institute

03:16:24.650 --> 03:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
Institute
 
03:16:27.050 --> 03:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
80 000 workers in the first
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
congressional district and 73 000
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
workers in the second congressional
 
03:16:34.969 --> 03:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
district will benefit from a fifteen
 
03:16:38.929 --> 03:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
dollar minimum wage by 2025. yet
 
03:16:41.929 --> 03:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
countless studies show that increases to
 
03:16:45.230 --> 03:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage have not resulted in
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
massive job losses
 
03:16:50.690 --> 03:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
though a 15 minimum wage is still not a
 
03:16:53.570 --> 03:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
living wage it can help lift individuals
 
03:16:56.809 --> 03:16:56.819 align:start position:0%
and families out of poverty establish a
 
03:16:59.330 --> 03:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
degree of Economic Security for them and
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
reduce chronic anxiety and stress often
 
03:17:04.250 --> 03:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
experienced due to income
 
03:17:04.260 --> 03:17:06.050 align:start position:0%
experienced due to income
insufficiencies

03:17:06.050 --> 03:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
insufficiencies
 
03:17:07.969 --> 03:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
employers would benefit from lower
 
03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
employee turnover and less money
 
03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
spent for hiring and training
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
as a taxpayer I'm concerned that many of
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
these workers
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
that would benefit from this bill depend
 
03:17:23.330 --> 03:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
on government safety net programs to
 
03:17:25.010 --> 03:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
supplement their salaries to meet their
 
03:17:27.550 --> 03:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
basic needs like food shelter
 
03:17:30.410 --> 03:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
transportation and Heating
 
03:17:33.290 --> 03:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
I urge all of my colleagues to join me
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
in not supporting
 
03:17:40.010 --> 03:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
this itl motion on the 15 minimum wage
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.070 --> 03:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
I want to let other people speak first
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
before I uh calling you a second time
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other individuals like to
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
speak representative Schultz
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
I too am a big fan of Roger Miller I
 
03:17:58.979 --> 03:17:59.990 align:start position:0%
I too am a big fan of Roger Miller I
think

03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:18:01.969 --> 03:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
it's a great thing to listen to so for
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
whatever that's worth but the other way
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
that um we're on the same page is an
 
03:18:11.090 --> 03:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
article I just handed out uh to you all
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
um regarding it has a graph that
 
03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
reflects the change adjusted for
 
03:18:22.130 --> 03:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
inflation of since the minimum wage
 
03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
began in October of 1938.
 
03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
began in October of 1938.
um

03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult to feed your family
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
pay for gas afford transportation in
 
03:18:36.720 --> 03:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
pay for gas afford transportation in
general

03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:18:41.389 --> 03:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
pay for our very exorbitant rents
 
03:18:43.790 --> 03:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and that's an unemotional argument
 
03:18:45.969 --> 03:18:45.979 align:start position:0%
it's just a fact
 
03:18:49.389 --> 03:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
we are in all of New England
 
03:18:53.330 --> 03:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than the minimum
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
wage in those States
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
we are the wealthiest state to default
 
03:19:01.010 --> 03:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
to 7.25 cents an hour
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
and what that means is given the high
 
03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
cost of living for heating assistance
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
for rents that keeps going up in a at a
 
03:19:12.830 --> 03:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
high rate to get a loan to buy a home is
 
03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:14.090 align:start position:0%
high rate to get a loan to buy a home is
impossible

03:19:14.090 --> 03:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
to afford the basics
 
03:19:20.170 --> 03:19:20.180 align:start position:0%
you need approximately for a family
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars according to
 
03:19:25.969 --> 03:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
another article I happen to have
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
um from CNBC news
 
03:19:29.160 --> 03:19:31.070 align:start position:0%
um from CNBC news
and

03:19:31.070 --> 03:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:31.080 --> 03:19:32.030 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:35.210 --> 03:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
to be able to do the basics
 
03:19:38.210 --> 03:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
means one very big point that I think is
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan one and that is our social
 
03:19:44.570 --> 03:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
safety net in New Hampshire was never
 
03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
meant to support workers
 
03:19:49.610 --> 03:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
we were never supposed to use that as a
 
03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
way to have wages paid for and
 
03:19:53.340 --> 03:19:54.769 align:start position:0%
way to have wages paid for and
supplemented

03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
supplemented
 
03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
in that manner workers
 
03:20:00.410 --> 03:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what all of us I think
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
believe is what any able-bodied or able
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
person's ability to do that work should
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
which is a Ford
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
just the basics that's all we're talking
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
here we're not talking frivolousness
 
03:20:16.370 --> 03:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
we're not even talking student loans or
 
03:20:18.769 --> 03:20:18.779 align:start position:0%
medical debt or you know saving for
 
03:20:20.330 --> 03:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
retirement all the things that I would
 
03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
personally say should be included
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
those are all still off the table never
 
03:20:24.960 --> 03:20:25.849 align:start position:0%
those are all still off the table never
mind

03:20:25.849 --> 03:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh vacation if you even have the ability
 
03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
to get paid
 
03:20:33.410 --> 03:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
vacations at all we're just talking the
 
03:20:37.250 --> 03:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
basics so why would the Live Free or Die
 
03:20:37.260 --> 03:20:38.570 align:start position:0%
basics so why would the Live Free or Die
state

03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we as lawmakers what under what
 
03:20:43.849 --> 03:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
justification do we have to allow
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
workers to be paid so low
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
that they have to go on assistance
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
I have no problem whatsoever for those
 
03:20:53.929 --> 03:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
that need it
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of illness or age or other
 
03:20:58.849 --> 03:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
issues to be able to be on that social
 
03:21:01.010 --> 03:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
safety net is what it's for
 
03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
but workers
 
03:21:04.490 --> 03:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely not
 
03:21:08.809 --> 03:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
so when you hear that it would be a a
 
03:21:13.190 --> 03:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
step higher to do the steps in the bill
 
03:21:14.990 --> 03:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
which by the way we don't get to 15
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
right away it's in three steps
 
03:21:19.020 --> 03:21:19.730 align:start position:0%
right away it's in three steps
um

03:21:19.730 --> 03:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:22.190 --> 03:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
we still are lagging behind literally
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
every state in New England
 
03:21:28.250 --> 03:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
and the states that default to 725
 
03:21:31.130 --> 03:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
include States like Kentucky Mississippi
 
03:21:31.140 --> 03:21:33.050 align:start position:0%
include States like Kentucky Mississippi
Alabama

03:21:33.050 --> 03:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
Alabama
 
03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
states where it's still probably not
 
03:21:38.330 --> 03:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
affordable for them either but far
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
easier to afford to live in States like
 
03:21:42.590 --> 03:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
that I know that because I happen to
 
03:21:44.809 --> 03:21:44.819 align:start position:0%
have grown up in one of those States
 
03:21:47.090 --> 03:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
there's just much more affordable to
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
live in an area with the ability to to
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
pay rent at a better price and not have
 
03:21:57.650 --> 03:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
to pay for heating assistance year round
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
so on that note
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
and with the interest of making sure
 
03:22:06.530 --> 03:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
workers who are doing what we ask of
 
03:22:06.540 --> 03:22:07.309 align:start position:0%
workers who are doing what we ask of
them

03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
to work within our economy
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and when employers aren't doing what
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
they should be doing paying folks a wage
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
that would not
 
03:22:22.010 --> 03:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
lead to needing social safety net this
 
03:22:23.230 --> 03:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
significantly improve that situation if
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
not completely fix it and um
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that Mr chair thank you
 
03:22:36.050 --> 03:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:38.450 --> 03:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I will be voting
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
for The Ito and uh the reason being I've
 
03:22:44.210 --> 03:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
got a close relative that uh that just
 
03:22:47.030 --> 03:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
started at a a local coffee and donut
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
shop that's notorious for paying low
 
03:22:52.969 --> 03:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
she started at 16 an hour a week and a
 
03:22:55.010 --> 03:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
half later they bumped her up a buck
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
okay she has she's uh nine months into
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
recovery nine months ago she was a crack
 
03:23:02.690 --> 03:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
addict with no work history for five
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
years okay we're not we're not talking a
 
03:23:06.650 --> 03:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
real prize here when you look at her her
 
03:23:08.990 --> 03:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
application her job application but they
 
03:23:13.010 --> 03:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
hired her at 16. okay 16 an hour
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
um I I think this minimum wage is is
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for status
 
03:23:22.729 --> 03:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
um and if the economy does go south and
 
03:23:24.349 --> 03:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh and businesses start having a real
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
hard time they need the ability to to be
 
03:23:29.090 --> 03:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
able to lay people off uh pay them at a
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
lower rate if they have to rather than
 
03:23:33.050 --> 03:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
go out of business uh you know we'll be
 
03:23:35.389 --> 03:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
we'll be jeopardizing the the uh the
 
03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
existence of a lot of small business
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
businesses if the economy gets bad
 
03:23:38.640 --> 03:23:39.410 align:start position:0%
businesses if the economy gets bad
enough

03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
enough
 
03:23:39.420 --> 03:23:40.610 align:start position:0%
enough
next

03:23:40.610 --> 03:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:23:41.570 --> 03:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
senator baroody thank you Mr chairman
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll find that people who
 
03:23:50.210 --> 03:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
benefit from this increase in minimum
 
03:23:50.220 --> 03:23:51.710 align:start position:0%
benefit from this increase in minimum
wage

03:23:51.710 --> 03:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:23:53.809 --> 03:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
um you're just going to pump that extra
 
03:23:56.050 --> 03:23:56.060 align:start position:0%
money back into the economy
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
a rising tide lifts all boats it's going
 
03:24:01.010 --> 03:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
back into everybody every business
 
03:24:01.020 --> 03:24:02.229 align:start position:0%
back into everybody every business
person

03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
every essential penny that they can
 
03:24:07.250 --> 03:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
spend no clothes or whatever they won't
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
be out buying big steak dinners but they
 
03:24:11.929 --> 03:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
might be able to go for coffee in the
 
03:24:11.939 --> 03:24:13.010 align:start position:0%
might be able to go for coffee in the
morning

03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:24:16.610 --> 03:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
and um the states that were mentioned
 
03:24:18.889 --> 03:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
before I think they're all Southern
 
03:24:20.450 --> 03:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
States and they don't have the high
 
03:24:22.370 --> 03:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
heating costs that we do
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
so increasing the minimum wage doesn't
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
mean that these people are going to go
 
03:24:29.510 --> 03:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
out shopping around for banks to see
 
03:24:31.130 --> 03:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
who's paying the highest interest rates
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
on your savings because they're not
 
03:24:34.429 --> 03:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
going to be saving it they're going to
 
03:24:36.889 --> 03:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
be spending it thank you
 
03:24:39.889 --> 03:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
03:24:42.530 --> 03:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I uh
 
03:24:46.490 --> 03:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the Ito motion let me uh
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
give you reasons why
 
03:24:51.769 --> 03:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
I have been in this room in rooms like
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
this for many years in testifying in
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
favor of increasing the minimum wage
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that it's not about
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's not about empirical evidence it's
 
03:25:06.290 --> 03:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
not about what's what we can prove uh by
 
03:25:08.809 --> 03:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
study after study after study
 
03:25:11.929 --> 03:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
what this is about quite frankly and you
 
03:25:14.269 --> 03:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
heard it in testimony from the industry
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
from some of the people in the
 
03:25:17.210 --> 03:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
industries that are here
 
03:25:18.889 --> 03:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
is we don't believe there should be a
 
03:25:20.750 --> 03:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
minimum wage at all
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
that we don't believe that the that we
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
as a as a uh a state and as a government
 
03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
who has an overall responsibility to
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
help people in the state of New
 
03:25:32.929 --> 03:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't believe you have any
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
role at all in that and then it should
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
be according to the those people who
 
03:25:38.399 --> 03:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
be according to the those people who
support

03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:25:42.050 --> 03:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
um keeping it where it is or eliminating
 
03:25:44.210 --> 03:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
which we have done in New Hampshire is
 
03:25:45.769 --> 03:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
that it should be based on free market
 
03:25:47.929 --> 03:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
just let the market take care of things
 
03:25:49.790 --> 03:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
well unfortunately the market doesn't
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
take care of things evenly and there are
 
03:25:54.410 --> 03:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
many people quite frankly that don't do
 
03:25:56.809 --> 03:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
well in the market for a whole lot of
 
03:25:56.819 --> 03:25:57.769 align:start position:0%
well in the market for a whole lot of
reasons

03:25:57.769 --> 03:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:26:00.170 --> 03:26:00.180 align:start position:0%
and so I am going to vote against this
 
03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh Ito because I think as a state
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative who comes from a large
 
03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
community where we have a lot of people
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
that don't make a whole lot of money did
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
I have a responsibility to stand up here
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
and to say look there should be a flaw a
 
03:26:16.490 --> 03:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
floor that that on that which nobody
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
drops below and that is a state
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative I have a responsibility a
 
03:26:24.650 --> 03:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
moral responsibility to help set that
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
floor so that people don't fall uh
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
people live in the margins don't fall
 
03:26:31.309 --> 03:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
into a place where they can't get out of
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Jim
 
03:26:34.319 --> 03:26:38.269 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Jim
welcome

03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
to I see no new hands oh Brian
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
03:26:47.690 --> 03:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:49.610 --> 03:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'll just emphasize one piece that's
 
03:26:51.170 --> 03:26:51.180 align:start position:0%
already been made and that is our
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
surrounding states they are all well on
 
03:26:56.990 --> 03:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
their way towards a 15 minimum wage
 
03:26:59.809 --> 03:26:59.819 align:start position:0%
it is an embarrassment for New Hampshire
 
03:27:04.610 --> 03:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
to lag behind and say 725 is good enough
 
03:27:07.610 --> 03:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
we ought to get with it tell our workers
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we value them
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
tell people who are considering moving
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire that we value workers
 
03:27:18.290 --> 03:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
and get on board with what the other New
 
03:27:21.250 --> 03:27:21.260 align:start position:0%
England states are doing in moving
 
03:27:23.929 --> 03:27:23.939 align:start position:0%
aggressively towards that 15 minimum
 
03:27:23.939 --> 03:27:24.830 align:start position:0%
aggressively towards that 15 minimum
wage

03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
again it's not going to take care of all
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
of their needs but it will provide a
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
floor like the representative just said
 
03:27:37.790 --> 03:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
to support our workers let's let our
 
03:27:40.250 --> 03:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
workers know that we value them
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.809 --> 03:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
03:27:46.450 --> 03:27:46.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:27:48.889 --> 03:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
I have heard it said that there's a
 
03:27:50.650 --> 03:27:50.660 align:start position:0%
preference for letting the federal
 
03:27:53.450 --> 03:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
government decide the minimum wage and
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
if they want to raise it that's then we
 
03:27:57.889 --> 03:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
don't be disadvantaging uh New Hampshire
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
but our Market in the New England states
 
03:28:03.950 --> 03:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
is is our Market that's that's where
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're competing for labor and we're
 
03:28:08.210 --> 03:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
probably losing quite a bit just people
 
03:28:09.889 --> 03:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
going over the Border
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they stay here because they don't
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
have to pay the other taxes but they
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
work over there and maybe they're
 
03:28:16.670 --> 03:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
willing to pay that income tax even
 
03:28:19.969 --> 03:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
heavens but uh I I think we need to
 
03:28:26.090 --> 03:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:28.490 --> 03:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
the economics behind raising the minimum
 
03:28:31.260 --> 03:28:32.510 align:start position:0%
the economics behind raising the minimum
wage

03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:28:35.210 --> 03:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
to me is clear if we raise
 
03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage and what we're paying
 
03:28:41.090 --> 03:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
our employees the cost to sell Goods the
 
03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
cost to sell labor the cost to make
 
03:28:45.769 --> 03:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
things is going to increase with it
 
03:28:47.450 --> 03:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know the single business that's
 
03:28:49.010 --> 03:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
going to take it on the chin to say okay
 
03:28:50.690 --> 03:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a pay raise but
 
03:28:52.370 --> 03:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to increase my labor rate
 
03:28:54.530 --> 03:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
so for every dollar that is increased in
 
03:28:56.809 --> 03:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
labor on your service provider level
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
they're increasing your billable rate to
 
03:29:01.490 --> 03:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
at least two dollars an hour so the cost
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
will continue to rise in my opinion we
 
03:29:05.389 --> 03:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
will forever have a minimum wage that is
 
03:29:07.010 --> 03:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
an unaffordable wage because we will
 
03:29:09.050 --> 03:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
continue to price ourselves out of a
 
03:29:11.570 --> 03:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
livable wage at a minimum wage wage rate
 
03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
I believe it should be left to the
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
employers to decide what the best choice
 
03:29:19.190 --> 03:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
is for their business model and I
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
personally do not like going to Home
 
03:29:22.849 --> 03:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
Depot or any grocery store and having to
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
check myself out and by raising minimum
 
03:29:27.170 --> 03:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
wages I fear that we are going to be
 
03:29:28.969 --> 03:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
losing more and more jobs and our
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment will be affected greatly
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:38.870 --> 03:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:41.929 --> 03:29:41.939 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be voting for itl basically
 
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the fact that if you watch the
 
03:29:46.370 --> 03:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
business news that is where the real
 
03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
News is located if you look at
 
03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
McDonald's because of the wage increase
 
03:29:55.010 --> 03:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
and and and the pressure being put upon
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
them the
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
um they have gone to automatic systems
 
03:30:04.190 --> 03:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
robots and stuff so that now you'll have
 
03:30:06.650 --> 03:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
robots serving you your McDonald's Happy
 
03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:07.490 align:start position:0%
robots serving you your McDonald's Happy
Meal

03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
Meal
 
03:30:10.969 --> 03:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
you don't have humans in those places if
 
03:30:13.130 --> 03:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
you look at Home Depot and you look at
 
03:30:15.830 --> 03:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
Lowe's they've already done away with
 
03:30:19.809 --> 03:30:19.819 align:start position:0%
cashiers okay they were your last uh
 
03:30:23.090 --> 03:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
hope of having some kind of employment
 
03:30:25.729 --> 03:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
and even with that they were still
 
03:30:30.170 --> 03:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
playing paying north of 15 an hour okay
 
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
so trying to continue to put pressure on
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
business and I have to agree with the
 
03:30:39.229 --> 03:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
other representative that there is a
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
margin between what they're going to
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
sell and their cost of doing business so
 
03:30:48.290 --> 03:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
every time you raise the cost of doing
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
business that's going to put the cost of
 
03:30:54.110 --> 03:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
the product go into the end user to cost
 
03:30:56.990 --> 03:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
more so if you looked at all those
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
relative statistics and you looked at
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
a gallon of milk and stuff you would
 
03:31:06.010 --> 03:31:06.020 align:start position:0%
still see it would be outside the range
 
03:31:09.530 --> 03:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
at Vista it's a local grocery store in
 
03:31:13.809 --> 03:31:13.819 align:start position:0%
my hometown it's 4.99 a gallon already
 
03:31:16.849 --> 03:31:16.859 align:start position:0%
okay and they have to sell it for that
 
03:31:20.030 --> 03:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
to make up for the cost it takes them to
 
03:31:22.490 --> 03:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
keep the operation running
 
03:31:26.510 --> 03:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
people were not meant to buy a house on
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
minimum wage people were not meant to go
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
out and buy automobiles those were
 
03:31:36.889 --> 03:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
starter jobs okay in the 90s we've
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
allowed all of our businesses to go
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
overseas now we're stuck in the service
 
03:31:44.809 --> 03:31:44.819 align:start position:0%
industry and we don't know how to get
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
out of that unless we bring
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing back so
 
03:31:54.050 --> 03:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why I'm voting for
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
itl thank you
 
03:32:01.070 --> 03:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative drego
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my statement I I
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
also too will be saying itl to this uh
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not because of the
 
03:32:08.040 --> 03:32:09.410 align:start position:0%
and it's not it's not because of the
1350

03:32:09.410 --> 03:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
1350
 
03:32:12.050 --> 03:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
or the 1425 or even the 15 I think if it
 
03:32:13.610 --> 03:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
was just one number
 
03:32:15.769 --> 03:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
put out there it might have had a better
 
03:32:15.779 --> 03:32:17.090 align:start position:0%
put out there it might have had a better
chance

03:32:17.090 --> 03:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
chance
 
03:32:19.370 --> 03:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't like the variable
 
03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh the rate at the end I call it a
 
03:32:21.960 --> 03:32:22.910 align:start position:0%
uh the rate at the end I call it a
variable

03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
variable
 
03:32:26.450 --> 03:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
um minimum wage every January from 2026
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
on it resets off the cost of living
 
03:32:30.769 --> 03:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
that does two things one it takes away
 
03:32:32.269 --> 03:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
the power of a legislator ever to change
 
03:32:33.530 --> 03:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
it again because it automatically
 
03:32:33.540 --> 03:32:34.910 align:start position:0%
it again because it automatically
updates

03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
updates
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and two
 
03:32:37.969 --> 03:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
it creates a huge issue for businesses
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
because every year they don't know what
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
the new minimum wage will be so the fact
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
that can always go up and never go down
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
one it's one way and two it also creates
 
03:32:51.290 --> 03:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
a kind of a cluster at the end of the
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
year for new hiring
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
somebody got hired in December might be
 
03:32:56.570 --> 03:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
one one rate and all of a sudden they're
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
getting grades because inflation is high
 
03:32:59.929 --> 03:32:59.939 align:start position:0%
or cost of living is high
 
03:33:02.090 --> 03:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
and uh it's just a very hard way to
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a business that has a
 
03:33:05.090 --> 03:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
multi-year contract
 
03:33:07.130 --> 03:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
now they're paying a higher rate for the
 
03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
second year of the contract but they
 
03:33:10.490 --> 03:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
can't go up on a contract so having a
 
03:33:13.309 --> 03:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
variable minimum wage is to me is just
 
03:33:15.530 --> 03:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
not not something that should be done
 
03:33:17.389 --> 03:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative see you
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman about two
 
03:33:26.570 --> 03:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
years ago I said something similar we
 
03:33:28.130 --> 03:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
have some new people so I get to make my
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
joke again I have a really nice job here
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman I get to sit up here
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
and look really important but I I really
 
03:33:38.809 --> 03:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
have no duties except for one in the
 
03:33:41.690 --> 03:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
house rules the vice chairman is tasked
 
03:33:44.809 --> 03:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
with looking at each bill and evaluating
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
it relative to the Constitution
 
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
so I want to bring that up again since
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
it is my job
 
03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
when I when I said this two years ago I
 
03:34:01.010 --> 03:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
had just been looking at a bill that at
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
first it struck me as very odd it was a
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
wage related bill
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
that covered everybody but Exempted
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
counties and municipalities
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
and my first thought was probably what
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
some people here are thinking well
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's kind of hypocritical it's good
 
03:34:22.130 --> 03:34:22.140 align:start position:0%
enough for to apply to all the Employers
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the state except the government
 
03:34:27.769 --> 03:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
but the reason became clear to me when I
 
03:34:30.769 --> 03:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
looked at the date on that bill it was
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
passed right after 28a was adopted by
 
03:34:35.929 --> 03:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and at that time
 
03:34:38.690 --> 03:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
legislators apparently were much more
 
03:34:42.530 --> 03:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
serious about conforming to that
 
03:34:44.929 --> 03:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment
 
03:34:48.050 --> 03:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
and the issue is the same if we raise
 
03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
03:34:52.969 --> 03:34:52.979 align:start position:0%
that will impose a cost on our towns and
 
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
our counties
 
03:34:57.050 --> 03:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
and the Constitution requires
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we either pay for that cost
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we exempt them from that cost or
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we allow the citizens of each
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
subdivision a vote on that cost
 
03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
so as it was my duty I felt I needed to
 
03:35:17.210 --> 03:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
bring that up and so I did thank you Mr
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Vice chairman I
 
03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
think everyone has spoken first who's
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go in the second time
 
03:35:26.889 --> 03:35:26.899 align:start position:0%
around just representative uh
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative Granger followed by
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
Cahill please
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you Mr chair uh it may
 
03:35:36.050 --> 03:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
seem weird to hear a young person say
 
03:35:37.610 --> 03:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
that they're passionate about not having
 
03:35:40.490 --> 03:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage uh someone earlier uh
 
03:35:43.010 --> 03:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh some Republicans would
 
03:35:44.330 --> 03:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
think that the proper minimum wage would
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
be zero I would be among them I think
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the minimum wage is a complete
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
travesty in the way that it completely
 
03:35:51.410 --> 03:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
just throws young people under the bus
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hold back any punches
 
03:35:55.550 --> 03:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
by it I'm going to get straight to the
 
03:35:58.130 --> 03:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
point I got out of high school in 2008
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
in New York
 
03:36:01.969 --> 03:36:01.979 align:start position:0%
I had to work under the table I made
 
03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
less than minimum wage that was the only
 
03:36:05.150 --> 03:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
way I could get a job
 
03:36:07.729 --> 03:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
everybody who said oh well the minimum
 
03:36:09.889 --> 03:36:09.899 align:start position:0%
wage is helping him out it isn't it's
 
03:36:11.690 --> 03:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
taking the bottom legs off the ladder
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to get out of the pit
 
03:36:15.050 --> 03:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
you're poor you're broke you can't get
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
out you can't earn 15 an hour you're not
 
03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
worth 15 an hour that's what the minimum
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
wage does it doesn't say we're going to
 
03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
give you a raise it only gives you a
 
03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
raise if you were already worth 15 an
 
03:36:27.650 --> 03:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
hour to that company if you're not worth
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars an hour to that company
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
you don't get a job you get to work
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
under the table you get to not get money
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
you get to be broke and guess what
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's what happened to me that was my
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
childhood or when I first became an
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
adult when I got out and started getting
 
03:36:42.590 --> 03:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
into the workplace that was how I got my
 
03:36:45.050 --> 03:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
living that was how I made them do all
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
right I worked under the table at farms
 
03:36:49.729 --> 03:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
wherever doing actual labor in order to
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
get ahead so everybody who tells me oh
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
well this is going to help the workers
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
no it isn't so I'd like to give a quote
 
03:36:57.650 --> 03:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
by Thomas Soul about the history of the
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
in 1925 this is a quote from Thomas salt
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
quote start in 1925 a minimum wage law
 
03:37:06.769 --> 03:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
was passed in the Canadian province of
 
03:37:08.330 --> 03:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
British Columbia with the intent and
 
03:37:10.190 --> 03:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
effect of pricing Japanese immigrants
 
03:37:11.690 --> 03:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
out of the jobs in the lumbering
 
03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:12.830 align:start position:0%
out of the jobs in the lumbering
industry

03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:37:15.410 --> 03:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
a Harvard professor of that era referred
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
approvingly to Australia's minimum wage
 
03:37:19.370 --> 03:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
law as a means to quote protect the
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
white Australian standard of living from
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the invidious competition of the colored
 
03:37:25.610 --> 03:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
races especially the Chinese who are
 
03:37:27.290 --> 03:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
willing to work for Less
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
in South Africa during the era of
 
03:37:31.370 --> 03:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
apartheid white labor unions urged that
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage law be applied to all
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
Races to keep black workers from taking
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
jobs away from White unionized workers
 
03:37:38.570 --> 03:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
by working for less than the union pay
 
03:37:38.580 --> 03:37:39.590 align:start position:0%
by working for less than the union pay
scale

03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
scale
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
some supporters of the First Federal
 
03:37:42.410 --> 03:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
minimum wage law of the United States
 
03:37:45.050 --> 03:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
the davis-bacon act of 1931 used the
 
03:37:47.090 --> 03:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
exact same rationale citing the fact
 
03:37:48.530 --> 03:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
that southern construction companies
 
03:37:51.050 --> 03:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
using non-union black workers were able
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
to come north and underbid construction
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
companies using unionized white labor
 
03:37:56.929 --> 03:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
end quote now the purpose of this quote
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
isn't to say that if you support a
 
03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
minimum wage lawyer racist I do not want
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
to imply that in any way I know that the
 
03:38:03.410 --> 03:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
people who are supporting this
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislation genuinely believe that they
 
03:38:06.889 --> 03:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
are helping people out but the economic
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
principle still applies syntaxes exist
 
03:38:10.849 --> 03:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
because we know that increasing the
 
03:38:12.170 --> 03:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
price of a good results in less
 
03:38:14.450 --> 03:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
consumption the point of increasing the
 
03:38:16.130 --> 03:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
price of cigarettes is to decrease the
 
03:38:17.870 --> 03:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
amount of people who smoke if you
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
increase the price of Labor that
 
03:38:21.410 --> 03:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
naturally leads to less people hiring
 
03:38:23.210 --> 03:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
now that may not sound like a big deal
 
03:38:25.130 --> 03:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
when unemployment is as low as it is and
 
03:38:27.290 --> 03:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a message desire for
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
workers but that's not going to be the
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
case forever the economy comes gets good
 
03:38:32.450 --> 03:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
the economy gets bad eventually the
 
03:38:34.190 --> 03:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
economy will be bad again and guess what
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of really
 
03:38:37.250 --> 03:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
broke teenagers who are looking for a
 
03:38:38.510 --> 03:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
job in order to get out into the world
 
03:38:39.650 --> 03:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
and they won't be able to get one
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
because we decided to pass minimum wage
 
03:38:43.969 --> 03:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
law thank you
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
yeah uh if the chair will allow I
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for the vice
 
03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:53.450 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for the vice
chair

03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:38:56.929 --> 03:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair uh could we in fact uh
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
finagle that restriction with the
 
03:39:05.530 --> 03:39:05.540 align:start position:0%
Constitution by saying that the revenue
 
03:39:07.190 --> 03:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
sharing that we do with the
 
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities covers this cost and so
 
03:39:12.530 --> 03:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
many others
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
I suppose if the revenue sharing is
 
03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:16.370 align:start position:0%
I suppose if the revenue sharing is
increased

03:39:16.370 --> 03:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
increased
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
to cover the costs you could say that I
 
03:39:22.490 --> 03:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
I haven't done the math on it though
 
03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
is there any further representative
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman seeing as we do
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue sharing with cities we don't do
 
03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
much revenue sharing with counties or
 
03:39:36.410 --> 03:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
the state so how would that apply
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know I was
 
03:39:40.250 --> 03:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know and I don't want to get
 
03:39:42.290 --> 03:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
into it it was a nice play question by
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
representative KO so we're going to move
 
03:39:46.849 --> 03:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
on to the people who want to uh speak a
 
03:39:47.809 --> 03:39:47.819 align:start position:0%
second time representative
 
03:39:50.269 --> 03:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie uh thank you Mr
 
03:39:53.929 --> 03:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
chairman and um I think the discussion
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
we've had here pretty clearly
 
03:39:59.330 --> 03:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
um signifies where people are in terms
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
of what side you're on and uh again as
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
those who believe in it and those who
 
03:40:06.050 --> 03:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
don't and here we are but that's not the
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
reason for my inquiry it relates to the
 
03:40:11.210 --> 03:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
statement just made by my colleague on
 
03:40:12.530 --> 03:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
the committee relative to the
 
03:40:12.540 --> 03:40:13.729 align:start position:0%
the committee relative to the
Constitution

03:40:13.729 --> 03:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I think to leave that uh on the
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
table uh is something that I think is
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
pretty dangerous to do
 
03:40:24.769 --> 03:40:24.779 align:start position:0%
we have all kinds of things that come in
 
03:40:26.570 --> 03:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
front of this committee that raise wages
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
that raise unemployment to raise workers
 
03:40:31.610 --> 03:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
compensation that raise all kinds of
 
03:40:31.620 --> 03:40:33.290 align:start position:0%
compensation that raise all kinds of
issues

03:40:33.290 --> 03:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:40:35.330 --> 03:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
um that could somebody could come in and
 
03:40:38.929 --> 03:40:38.939 align:start position:0%
claim that the that the 28a limits us
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
from making those kinds of decisions now
 
03:40:42.290 --> 03:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
I don't have the court information
 
03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
firmly but I believe the courts have
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
ruled on that that in fact that's not
 
03:40:48.889 --> 03:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
the case that we have the authority to
 
03:40:51.469 --> 03:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
to make those kinds of those kinds of
 
03:40:53.530 --> 03:40:53.540 align:start position:0%
decisions as a committee
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we can move forward with now we're
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna hear other legislation
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee that people
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
claim have costs of the communities and
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
therefore we can't do it so I I would
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
challenge that respectfully of my
 
03:41:07.610 --> 03:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
colleague on this committee and I think
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
there should be some clarification
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
um relative to those kinds of things and
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
somebody has it's a constitutional
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
attorney or somebody from the state that
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
can inform this committee relative to
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.809 --> 03:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands
 
03:41:31.729 --> 03:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
I will make my comments and we will have
 
03:41:35.170 --> 03:41:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:38.210 --> 03:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
I was taught something early on in my
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
career as a freshman legislator
 
03:41:42.889 --> 03:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
that we should never
 
03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
do anything that puts
 
03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:47.690 align:start position:0%
do anything that puts
um

03:41:47.690 --> 03:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
an obligation onto another legislature
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to finances
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh we make our own decisions uh in each
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
legislature has a chance to make its own
 
03:41:59.450 --> 03:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
financial decisions so I have a problem
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
and I always have I've been consistent
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
with many years I have a problem with an
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
increase in the minimum wage based on
 
03:42:07.370 --> 03:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Price Index
 
03:42:09.170 --> 03:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
every legislature should make that
 
03:42:09.180 --> 03:42:10.610 align:start position:0%
every legislature should make that
decision

03:42:10.610 --> 03:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
I was up in Laconia yesterday and uh
 
03:42:16.190 --> 03:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
I got a soda
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
um their advertisement for 17 an hour
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
on the way here this morning
 
03:42:28.690 --> 03:42:28.700 align:start position:0%
they're advertising on
 
03:42:33.889 --> 03:42:33.899 align:start position:0%
wgir am uh 35 an hour
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
for um
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
laborers and such at a Paving Company
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
they're already looking for people
 
03:42:42.239 --> 03:42:43.010 align:start position:0%
they're already looking for people
um

03:42:43.010 --> 03:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:45.889 --> 03:42:45.899 align:start position:0%
so there there are New Hampshire has a
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
very good economy probably the best
 
03:42:51.410 --> 03:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
economy uh in New England and the one of
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
the lowest lowest unemployment rates
 
03:42:56.929 --> 03:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
and I and I like letting businesses make
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
the decision on what they're going to
 
03:42:58.439 --> 03:43:00.170 align:start position:0%
the decision on what they're going to
pay

03:43:00.170 --> 03:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
they do a better job
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester recently uh made
 
03:43:08.210 --> 03:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
a decision both the school board and I
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
think the alderman had already done it
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
to increase the minimum wage for any
 
03:43:14.150 --> 03:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
employee hired to 15 an hour which I'm
 
03:43:15.290 --> 03:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
because they made the decision they made
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
the decision as a as a board
 
03:43:20.819 --> 03:43:21.650 align:start position:0%
the decision as a as a board
um

03:43:21.650 --> 03:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:25.010 --> 03:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
the um lastly
 
03:43:25.020 --> 03:43:26.090 align:start position:0%
the um lastly
um

03:43:26.090 --> 03:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:28.370 --> 03:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
the last session of Congress
 
03:43:30.410 --> 03:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
had one party in charge of all three
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
branches of the Congress and all all
 
03:43:34.910 --> 03:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
three branches not all three branches
 
03:43:37.729 --> 03:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
but how's the Senate and the presidency
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
and when it came to raising the minimum
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
wage of 15 our Congressional Delegation
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
did not vote in favor of that
 
03:43:48.110 --> 03:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
um so to ask us to to do something that
 
03:43:51.290 --> 03:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't uh I find inconsistent
 
03:43:54.050 --> 03:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting no
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
um in favor of the bill even though a
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
lot of you know what my opinion is on
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
getting this monkey off the table off
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
the back and and doing
 
03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
um the things that we should do as a
 
03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
state but this is not the right bill
 
03:44:12.170 --> 03:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
see there's no other comment
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
Madam Clerk
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first of all our um
 
03:44:19.130 --> 03:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
two Congressional representatives to the
 
03:44:20.929 --> 03:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
U.S House of Representatives did vote
 
03:44:24.349 --> 03:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
for uh 15 minimum wage it did not have a
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
vote in the U.S Senate
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um for whatever that's worth
 
03:44:31.790 --> 03:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I also though if folks are willing to
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
do an amendment to exclude the cola and
 
03:44:38.929 --> 03:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
have a 13 minimum wage a 15 minimum wage
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%

would welcome that and that's something
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
we could do we have not locked any view
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%

03:45:03.420 --> 03:45:05.769 align:start position:0%

support this bill in the manner in which
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%

House Bill 58 FN
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
a call on representative Schultz for a
 
03:49:10.010 --> 03:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
motion okay thank you Mr chair I would
 
03:49:13.490 --> 03:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
like to move on to pass with Amendment
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
and present the amendment first
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
um you should have a copy of it but I
 
03:49:22.070 --> 03:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
did put together because I've heard a
 
03:49:24.170 --> 03:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
bunch of questions
 
03:49:26.330 --> 03:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
um let me hand this in
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.399 --> 03:49:33.309 align:start position:0%
 
202

03:49:33.309 --> 03:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
202
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
3-070h is being moved
 
03:49:39.650 --> 03:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
oh sorry um
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schultz has moved
 
03:49:42.899 --> 03:49:46.990 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schultz has moved
Amendment

03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.150 --> 03:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
2023-00708 is there a second
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh recognized PQ uh
 
03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:00.769 align:start position:0%
representative uh recognized PQ uh
motion

03:50:00.769 --> 03:50:00.779 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
so just as a blanket statement I'd like
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
to suggest that even if you're inclined
 
03:50:09.050 --> 03:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
to not support the bill uh this makes
 
03:50:13.969 --> 03:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
the bill better it simplifies the law
 
03:50:16.490 --> 03:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
um so what I have passed around is an
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
additional copy of the amendment which
 
03:50:20.690 --> 03:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
you probably already have it's very
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
simply worded if you'll see at the end
 
03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
of line seven
 
03:50:28.250 --> 03:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
it says subject to the following
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
exceptions colon
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
now the original bill would accept would
 
03:50:36.889 --> 03:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
have eliminated all of the carve outs
 
03:50:36.899 --> 03:50:38.030 align:start position:0%
have eliminated all of the carve outs
that

03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
um many of which are very popular I've
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
not I've since learned I've gotten a
 
03:50:45.170 --> 03:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
lesson on skiing patrols and lots of
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
other things but if you turn to the
 
03:50:49.190 --> 03:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
third page
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see this is the section of the
 
03:50:54.349 --> 03:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
law that comes after the colon
 
03:50:56.690 --> 03:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the existing bill this would all be
 
03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
eliminated these are the carve outs
 
03:51:03.050 --> 03:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
um like the ability for people to
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
essentially be volunteers ski patrol
 
03:51:09.650 --> 03:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
folks and be given
 
03:51:09.660 --> 03:51:10.490 align:start position:0%
folks and be given
um

03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
ski passes I guess for the winter I
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't exactly know how that works
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I would love to learn to ski someday
 
03:51:19.550 --> 03:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
but all of these sections
 
03:51:21.710 --> 03:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
um would probably
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
rather than address them in the bill if
 
03:51:26.929 --> 03:51:26.939 align:start position:0%
we did want to address any of them that
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
should come under a separate bill in the
 
03:51:33.050 --> 03:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
future so just to improve the bill
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
as a bit of housekeeping I did not
 
03:51:39.969 --> 03:51:39.979 align:start position:0%
um want to have the existing bill
 
03:51:43.010 --> 03:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
eliminate the carve-outs
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
I hope that makes sense if not I can
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
03:51:55.080 --> 03:51:56.630 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
foreign

03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:52:00.229 --> 03:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
yes I I will take responsibility for
 
03:52:02.210 --> 03:52:02.220 align:start position:0%
asking for this amendment
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
um I didn't think it was proper to be
 
03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
repealing a whole bunch of exceptions
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
without uh
 
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
really having people understanding that
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
that was happening and the way the bills
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
were drafted you'd look at the bill and
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
you could see that it was repealing the
 
03:52:19.849 --> 03:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
sub minimum wage for tipped workers but
 
03:52:21.290 --> 03:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
you couldn't see all the other stuff
 
03:52:23.570 --> 03:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
that was being repealed and as rep
 
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
Schultz just said if there was an
 
03:52:28.849 --> 03:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
interest in doing that it should be in a
 
03:52:31.090 --> 03:52:31.100 align:start position:0%
separate bill with a separate hearing
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
giving anyone who had an interest in
 
03:52:36.769 --> 03:52:36.779 align:start position:0%
those exceptions an opportunity to come
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
before this committee and testify either
 
03:52:43.849 --> 03:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
in favor or against the repeal so I
 
03:52:46.190 --> 03:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
believe this amendment gives us a much
 
03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
cleaner bill
 
03:52:51.170 --> 03:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
all it does is repeal the sub minimum
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
wage for tipped workers it does nothing
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
else and it's
 
03:52:57.729 --> 03:52:57.739 align:start position:0%
um much easier to
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
contemplate I understand that some
 
03:53:03.050 --> 03:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
people don't contemplate the same way I
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
do on it but um at least we're
 
03:53:09.050 --> 03:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
it's not muddy anymore it's very clear
 
03:53:13.870 --> 03:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.170 --> 03:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's not typical but since the amendment
 
03:53:21.290 --> 03:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
um clarify clarify something and changes
 
03:53:23.450 --> 03:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
something back to the original Law of
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just to be clear
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
that it removes the first two paragraphs
 
03:53:36.490 --> 03:53:36.500 align:start position:0%
of 279 colon 21 which deals with the
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
hourly rates for uh chipped employees
 
03:53:44.630 --> 03:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
correct it leaves it in place I mean it
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
replaces it with the language in the
 
03:53:49.309 --> 03:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
bill itself so the amendment would only
 
03:53:49.319 --> 03:53:51.370 align:start position:0%
bill itself so the amendment would only
address

03:53:51.370 --> 03:53:51.380 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:53:54.410 --> 03:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
retaining those carve outs
 
03:53:56.929 --> 03:53:56.939 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself doesn't
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
um change the intent of the bill which
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
was to address
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
tipped wage workers specifically
 
03:54:07.330 --> 03:54:07.340 align:start position:0%
um without any unintended consequences
 
03:54:11.929 --> 03:54:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
does everyone understand what the carve
 
03:54:14.290 --> 03:54:14.300 align:start position:0%
outs are
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's complicated there are certain carve
 
03:54:19.130 --> 03:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
outs to the weights that have been made
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
over the years yeah okay Madness yes on
 
03:54:24.490 --> 03:54:24.500 align:start position:0%
the second page
 
03:54:27.769 --> 03:54:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.160 --> 03:54:33.229 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:54:36.349 --> 03:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
so we have an amendment of a motion
 
03:54:37.550 --> 03:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
um it's been seconded there's been
 
03:54:38.689 --> 03:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
discussion is there any further
 
03:54:40.250 --> 03:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
discussion before I call the roll
 
03:54:40.260 --> 03:54:42.410 align:start position:0%
discussion before I call the roll
representative

03:54:42.410 --> 03:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman section eight of
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
279 fall and 21 ultimate records for
 
03:54:48.960 --> 03:54:50.990 align:start position:0%
279 fall and 21 ultimate records for
sure

03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
I found um
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.309 --> 03:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
one more time section eight those
 
03:55:02.990 --> 03:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
employees covered by the introductory
 
03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:05.090 align:start position:0%
employees covered by the introductory
paragraph

03:55:05.090 --> 03:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:55:07.929 --> 03:55:07.939 align:start position:0%
second States for Halloween
 
03:55:10.370 --> 03:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
so making sure the best can be changed
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
as well as what the changes in the
 
03:55:12.359 --> 03:55:15.290 align:start position:0%
as well as what the changes in the
humanity

03:55:15.290 --> 03:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.170 --> 03:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
well the introductory as the amendment
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
is written the introductory paragraph
 
03:55:23.330 --> 03:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
isn't touched by the amendment but the
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
bill itself would be different
 
03:55:28.370 --> 03:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
so as it refers to the introductory
 
03:55:32.750 --> 03:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph which in the law itself is
 
03:55:35.450 --> 03:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
um has no additional Roman numerals like
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
this one does it would apply that change
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
so the original Bill does change the
 
03:55:43.849 --> 03:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph I think that was
 
03:55:45.889 --> 03:55:45.899 align:start position:0%
a very complicated way of agreeing with
 
03:55:45.899 --> 03:55:47.809 align:start position:0%
a very complicated way of agreeing with
you

03:55:47.809 --> 03:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:55:47.819 --> 03:55:51.950 align:start position:0%
you
sorry

03:55:51.950 --> 03:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.530 --> 03:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
follow up I would that be handled with
 
03:55:57.170 --> 03:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
overtime the state's overtime for those
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
particular work that invest in another
 
03:56:01.969 --> 03:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
law with another bill
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
I believe the existing law on overtime
 
03:56:04.560 --> 03:56:06.170 align:start position:0%
I believe the existing law on overtime
laws

03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
laws
 
03:56:09.650 --> 03:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
um would still apply I don't I can look
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
it up we could look it up I don't
 
03:56:15.370 --> 03:56:15.380 align:start position:0%
believe the initial paragraph on
 
03:56:19.729 --> 03:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
279 colon 21 addresses that
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
but let's look it up I realize you're a
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner and probably have it
 
03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:31.189 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner and probably have it
memorized

03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.170 --> 03:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
yeah let me look it up when I answer his
 
03:56:35.750 --> 03:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
question correctly
 
03:56:37.610 --> 03:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
or a person from the labor department at
 
03:56:37.620 --> 03:56:44.710 align:start position:0%
or a person from the labor department at
Indiana

03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
sorry guys can I see what you're doing
 
03:56:46.859 --> 03:56:49.790 align:start position:0%
sorry guys can I see what you're doing
now

03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
what's in here if we have the books it's
 
03:57:14.030 --> 03:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.130 --> 03:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
any aspect of the existing law that
 
03:57:16.140 --> 03:57:17.689 align:start position:0%
any aspect of the existing law that
addresses

03:57:17.689 --> 03:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
03:57:21.530 --> 03:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
so the bill itself doesn't change that
 
03:57:35.389 --> 03:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
the existing it as my reading of it and
 
03:57:40.729 --> 03:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this is something our
 
03:57:42.650 --> 03:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee assistant could help with but
 
03:57:45.469 --> 03:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
in my reading of the existing law and
 
03:57:47.210 --> 03:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
03:57:50.689 --> 03:57:50.699 align:start position:0%
I do not see any additional reference to
 
03:57:54.530 --> 03:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
overtime in that regard
 
03:57:57.050 --> 03:57:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so I assume that's under a different
 
03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
part of the law or continues it with
 
03:58:01.849 --> 03:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
those carve outs including that section
 
03:58:04.130 --> 03:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
that you've read so as far as I can tell
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:22.849 --> 03:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
those employees covered by the
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph of this section
 
03:58:26.689 --> 03:58:26.699 align:start position:0%
with the following exceptions so in
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
addition to the regular compensation
 
03:58:31.250 --> 03:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's a different part of the law
 
03:58:31.260 --> 03:58:32.870 align:start position:0%
that's a different part of the law
well

03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:58:36.530 --> 03:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
sorry a section 22 is not addressed in
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
the bill or the amendment other than if
 
03:58:41.330 --> 03:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
any references to it or existing in the
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
text but it does not change
 
03:58:47.689 --> 03:58:47.699 align:start position:0%
the the subsequent sections of the law
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
it only addresses 279 colon 21. right
 
03:58:53.450 --> 03:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
which is what I'm reading representative
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
so so if I'm looking at 279 21 sorry
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
Roman 8
 
03:59:02.450 --> 03:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay okay yeah
 
03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna work through this sure
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
7121 Roman 8.
 
03:59:07.680 --> 03:59:10.429 align:start position:0%
7121 Roman 8.
okay

03:59:10.429 --> 03:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.090 --> 03:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
so how does this not affect
 
03:59:14.100 --> 03:59:16.189 align:start position:0%
so how does this not affect
this

03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:59:18.469 --> 03:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
sentence here
 
03:59:21.650 --> 03:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
well I will say I did go over this
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
um not from a policy discussion but just
 
03:59:27.710 --> 03:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
um in a discussion regarding how the
 
03:59:29.210 --> 03:59:29.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor here in New
 
03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire views it I don't know if I
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
should say Rudy's name but he and I went
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
line by line of these carve outs and as
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
far as I understand it
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
um those sections would remain and not
 
03:59:45.410 --> 03:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
go away with the amendment so
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
um given that the introductory paragraph
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
would change
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
but the carve outs including the text
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
you just referenced would not be
 
03:59:56.030 --> 03:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated in this amendment with this
 
03:59:56.040 --> 03:59:57.309 align:start position:0%
eliminated in this amendment with this
amendment

03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:59:59.870 --> 03:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill Still Remains and
 
04:00:01.849 --> 04:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any major changes in
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
that sense
 
04:00:05.090 --> 04:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
is anyone from the Department of Labor
 
04:00:11.090 --> 04:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
I just called up the law and essentially
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
the portion of the introductory
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph that's been removed is a part
 
04:00:25.010 --> 04:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
that deals with tipped workers
 
04:00:28.610 --> 04:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
um so basically Section 8 simply says
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
that if you're making the minimum wage
 
04:00:33.530 --> 04:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
you'll get time and a half for over 40
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
hours I think I believe it still works
 
04:00:39.710 --> 04:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
cleanly and effectively but we simply no
 
04:00:42.650 --> 04:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
longer have a tip to minimum wage so I
 
04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I will say Mr chair that matches I
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the Department of Labor
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
but I did go line by line in great
 
04:00:53.040 --> 04:00:54.650 align:start position:0%
but I did go line by line in great
detail

04:00:54.650 --> 04:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
detail
 
04:00:54.660 --> 04:00:56.030 align:start position:0%
detail
um

04:00:56.030 --> 04:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:58.030 --> 04:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
we could
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
I was going to make sure that I'm
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
representing to everybody here what
 
04:01:08.330 --> 04:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I need to read this if you on a Brian
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind um
 
04:01:15.849 --> 04:01:15.859 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
I seen
 
04:01:21.410 --> 04:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:30.610 --> 04:01:30.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um also a Section
 
04:01:34.250 --> 04:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
8 also has a and N A one if it does not
 
04:01:35.809 --> 04:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
operate for more than seven months in a
 
04:01:39.410 --> 04:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
calendar year so if it was a
 
04:01:41.570 --> 04:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
anything that didn't operate on a
 
04:01:43.250 --> 04:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
seasonal basis would that would they
 
04:01:49.929 --> 04:01:49.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
um you and I uh discussed prior to that
 
04:01:57.050 --> 04:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
we would accept the motion
 
04:01:59.090 --> 04:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
I think we're all
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
um realistic here that the motion
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
um will on this bill excuse me the final
 
04:02:06.050 --> 04:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
tally vote on this bill will be
 
04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
consistent with the previous bill
 
04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
I am unsure
 
04:02:13.790 --> 04:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
whether this amendment does what
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
initially requested
 
04:02:17.040 --> 04:02:19.429 align:start position:0%
initially requested
um

04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.439 --> 04:02:21.710 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:02:21.710 --> 04:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
airing the side of caution I would
 
04:02:23.699 --> 04:02:24.650 align:start position:0%
airing the side of caution I would
rather

04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:02:26.689 --> 04:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
vote in the bill as is you still have
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
the ability since it's going to be a
 
04:02:31.250 --> 04:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
um no recommendation of the floor to
 
04:02:33.290 --> 04:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
bring forth an amendment
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm what you and I discuss and what
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
I am unsure that it's going to do that
 
04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
and not conflict with the other things
 
04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like your I guess I don't share your
 
04:02:49.620 --> 04:02:50.689 align:start position:0%
I'd like your I guess I don't share your
um

04:02:50.689 --> 04:02:50.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
lack of Surety because looking at it as
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
I said a minute ago it carves out the
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
chunk of the opening paragraph that
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
deals with sub minimum wage it leaves
 
04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
intact the part of this opening
 
04:03:08.090 --> 04:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
paragraph that marries our New
 
04:03:10.010 --> 04:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's minimum wage to the federal
 
04:03:13.510 --> 04:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in all aspects of these
 
04:03:17.809 --> 04:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
provisions on the third page remain in
 
04:03:21.170 --> 04:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
place and they seem to work just fine
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:03:25.010 --> 04:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage is New Hampshire's
 
04:03:28.370 --> 04:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
minimum wage I don't see a conflict
 
04:03:30.650 --> 04:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
04:03:32.929 --> 04:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
would appreciate if you would share what
 
04:03:36.410 --> 04:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
you whispered to me all right
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
here don't don't whisper things to the
 
04:03:40.849 --> 04:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
chairman he makes you share them with
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the class don't don't see that my issue
 
04:03:46.729 --> 04:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
with this is that the the old
 
04:03:49.370 --> 04:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph talked about tip
 
04:03:53.950 --> 04:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
workers exclusively and chapter what
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.530 --> 04:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
for an executive session but we have to
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to make sure before they
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
vote on this that we're on the same that
 
04:04:09.290 --> 04:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
everyone understands it all right all
 
04:04:10.490 --> 04:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
right so I won't say the word
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
exclusively again I'm quickly reading it
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
looks like the first paragraph of 279 21
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
talks about tip workers
 
04:04:21.290 --> 04:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
Section 8 says if you are covered in
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
that first paragraph
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
and you work more than 40 hours a week
 
04:04:28.250 --> 04:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
you get time and a half for it
 
04:04:31.250 --> 04:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
which means if so if you are getting the
 
04:04:35.090 --> 04:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
327 an hour which is specified in the
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
second paragraph
 
04:04:38.750 --> 04:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
but you do you work more than 40 hours
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
an hour 40 hours a week those additional
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
hours would be
 
04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh now hard math whatever 3 27 times
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
time and a half is or something so we're
 
04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to change if we adopt this
 
04:04:54.650 --> 04:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
amendment that first paragraph
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
he'll refer to home workers in which
 
04:04:59.450 --> 04:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
case eight says those employees covered
 
04:05:02.090 --> 04:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
which is everybody get time and a half
 
04:05:05.929 --> 04:05:05.939 align:start position:0%
pay once they go over 40. and
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
what I was whispering to the chairman is
 
04:05:12.830 --> 04:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
I do agree that that doesn't sound like
 
04:05:14.809 --> 04:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
that's the way I read it but that
 
04:05:16.250 --> 04:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like the way this
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:23.450 --> 04:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
may I try again
 
04:05:26.929 --> 04:05:26.939 align:start position:0%
yes thank you yep thank you Mr chairman
 
04:05:29.510 --> 04:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is I appreciate your
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
allowing us to clarify
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the current law 279.21
 
04:05:38.929 --> 04:05:38.939 align:start position:0%
first sentence unless otherwise provided
 
04:05:42.610 --> 04:05:42.620 align:start position:0%
by Statute no person firm or Corporation
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
shall employ any employee at an hourly
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
rate lower than that set forth in the
 
04:05:50.929 --> 04:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage as amended
 
04:05:50.939 --> 04:05:52.729 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage as amended
period

04:05:52.729 --> 04:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:05:55.610 --> 04:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
the next sentence starts with tipped
 
04:05:55.620 --> 04:05:57.469 align:start position:0%
the next sentence starts with tipped
employees

04:05:57.469 --> 04:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:06:00.410 --> 04:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
everything from that
 
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
sentence starting with tipped employees
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
to the end of the opening paragraph is
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
repealed by both the original Bill and
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment so basically
 
04:06:15.530 --> 04:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
04:06:18.769 --> 04:06:18.779 align:start position:0%
as proposed everything on that second
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
page would apply to those people earning
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage just the folks in that
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
so basically it says that if you work
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
more than 40 hours a week you get time
 
04:06:36.490 --> 04:06:36.500 align:start position:0%
and a half that's one and a half times
 
04:06:39.469 --> 04:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
seven twenty five an hour
 
04:06:41.809 --> 04:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
it works
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think there's a problem
 
04:06:43.859 --> 04:06:45.170 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think there's a problem
here

04:06:45.170 --> 04:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:06:45.180 --> 04:06:45.950 align:start position:0%
here
um

04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:49.729 --> 04:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
we've simply take carved out the tipped
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
minimum wage from the minimum wage
 
04:06:54.530 --> 04:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
itself so basically everybody including
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
the tip workers are in at least 725 an
 
04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
hour plus tips
 
04:07:00.359 --> 04:07:01.250 align:start position:0%
hour plus tips
um

04:07:01.250 --> 04:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me I hope it's clear to
 
04:07:03.840 --> 04:07:05.030 align:start position:0%
it's clear to me I hope it's clear to
others

04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:07:05.040 --> 04:07:07.910 align:start position:0%
others
representing

04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:07:09.170 --> 04:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just for
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
clarification are we talking about the
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
first paragraph or the second paragraph
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
because the second paragraph also
 
04:07:13.979 --> 04:07:15.769 align:start position:0%
because the second paragraph also
references

04:07:15.769 --> 04:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
references
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph because the first
 
04:07:20.570 --> 04:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
paragraph is the one referenced
 
04:07:20.580 --> 04:07:23.290 align:start position:0%
paragraph is the one referenced
um

04:07:23.290 --> 04:07:23.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
I don't even know where what are you
 
04:07:26.689 --> 04:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
talking about with the second paragraph
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's too bad
 
04:07:31.130 --> 04:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman yes yes
 
04:07:31.140 --> 04:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman yes yes
um

04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
the following exceptions unless
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise otherwise but otherwise
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
provided by Statute no question form
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and then it defines tipped employees
 
04:07:42.290 --> 04:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
under 178 colon 20. are you removing
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the whole thing is removed yes but
 
04:07:49.370 --> 04:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's two separate paragraphs in that
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes but
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
the whole thing is removed the only
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing this does is put back in the
 
04:07:57.290 --> 04:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
exclusions correct
 
04:07:59.929 --> 04:07:59.939 align:start position:0%
because it's reading this it's just by
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
the following exceptions but the colon
 
04:08:05.269 --> 04:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
it still provides for tipped employees
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
um line seven
 
04:08:14.210 --> 04:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
yeah fourth and the federal minimum wage
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
laws as amended subject to the following
 
04:08:18.170 --> 04:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
exceptions colon gives you a second
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph um it starts with unless
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided
 
04:08:24.769 --> 04:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure that that is that comes
 
04:08:26.809 --> 04:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
at the end of the second paragraph It's
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
also at the end of the first paragraph
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay you're right
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
I'm just want to make sure that we're
 
04:08:36.530 --> 04:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
deleting the entire first paragraph and
 
04:08:38.689 --> 04:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
second paragraph that is correct that's
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
04:08:43.130 --> 04:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I would like to add that
 
04:08:44.809 --> 04:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
that is what the bill does
 
04:08:47.170 --> 04:08:47.180 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the amendment itself
 
04:08:49.849 --> 04:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
we're just keeping the carve outs in
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
place and that's the existing law
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
already so
 
04:08:57.290 --> 04:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
um the amendment really is about
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
keeping in a part of the law that people
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
feel is already working or not a part of
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
the discussion and the intent of the
 
04:09:07.490 --> 04:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
original bill so what you're citing is
 
04:09:07.500 --> 04:09:09.650 align:start position:0%
original bill so what you're citing is
already

04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.210 --> 04:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
didn't realize
 
04:09:19.370 --> 04:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay is everyone completely confused or
 
04:09:22.250 --> 04:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
are you all following along here
 
04:09:22.260 --> 04:09:23.330 align:start position:0%
are you all following along here
okay

04:09:23.330 --> 04:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:23.340 --> 04:09:25.309 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:28.729 --> 04:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:39.769 --> 04:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.290 --> 04:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie uh I realized
 
04:09:51.530 --> 04:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
it's a 208 but the labor department is
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
10 minutes away from here
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
I would think that we could probably get
 
04:09:57.889 --> 04:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
Rudy over here somebody from the
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
Department over here to make sure we all
 
04:10:02.450 --> 04:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
understand what it is we're voting on uh
 
04:10:06.170 --> 04:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
so it's clear uh so I I would make that
 
04:10:08.210 --> 04:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
suggestion perhaps
 
04:10:10.250 --> 04:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to uh break in the middle
 
04:10:15.290 --> 04:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
the chairman wants to race us
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
I think you could recess this and move
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
on to the other ones and then
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh
 
04:10:31.010 --> 04:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.020 --> 04:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill 58
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call see if I can get
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
someone and the vice chairman is going
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
to resume with the next bill on House
 
04:10:49.010 --> 04:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 74. and you will not call a vote
 
04:10:54.170 --> 04:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.180 --> 04:10:57.889 align:start position:0%
 
emotions

04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:59.689 --> 04:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to
 
04:11:04.750 --> 04:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
open the executive session on how spill
 
04:11:04.760 --> 04:11:06.530 align:start position:0%
open the executive session on how spill
74.

04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
74.
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
and I would like Mr chairman yes may
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
movement Amendment
 
04:11:12.840 --> 04:11:15.410 align:start position:0%
movement Amendment
um

04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
I didn't record
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
I was going I want to recognize
 
04:11:23.689 --> 04:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni for a motion
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
let's see and uh
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
I expect there will be
 
04:11:37.130 --> 04:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
a point where the amendment can be moved
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
I would hope so
 
04:11:42.110 --> 04:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
if if not now then later but I thought
 
04:11:44.450 --> 04:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
now was an excellent time to do it
 
04:11:48.290 --> 04:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Abalone thank you Mr
 
04:11:54.010 --> 04:11:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:56.650 --> 04:11:56.660 align:start position:0%
that has been moved in second
 
04:11:59.210 --> 04:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative avalani is
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak on his motion thank
 
04:12:03.889 --> 04:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um as was heard through
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
um we're changing
 
04:12:07.199 --> 04:12:10.010 align:start position:0%
um we're changing
um

04:12:10.010 --> 04:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.769 --> 04:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
wages due to earn time vacation time and
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
paid time off shall be considered
 
04:12:17.520 --> 04:12:19.010 align:start position:0%
paid time off shall be considered
compensation

04:12:19.010 --> 04:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
04:12:21.110 --> 04:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I think that that is left up to the
 
04:12:24.290 --> 04:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
employer and employee to determine
 
04:12:24.300 --> 04:12:25.550 align:start position:0%
employer and employee to determine
um

04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:28.370 --> 04:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
moving forward I think that would be the
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
Best Way Forward on part of this the
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
other part of this the
 
04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
department has already said that it's
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
hard to go after the former owner or
 
04:12:42.650 --> 04:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
unclaimed wages as that they have been
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
dissolved I think that this bill
 
04:12:47.809 --> 04:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
well well-intentioned and everything
 
04:12:49.370 --> 04:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
else is
 
04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.849 --> 04:12:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman in addition to
 
04:13:04.130 --> 04:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
the previous estate concerns which I I
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
Echo and agree with I also have concerns
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill is effective 60 days
 
04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
after it is signed into law which
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
essentially would be retroactive as
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
viewed to any vacation time that an
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
employee has in the bank at that time
 
04:13:21.650 --> 04:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I have very concerned a lot of
 
04:13:23.570 --> 04:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
concerns about changing the rules on
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
time that's already in the bank with
 
04:13:25.319 --> 04:13:26.389 align:start position:0%
time that's already in the bank with
employers

04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
employers
 
04:13:29.150 --> 04:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
much more so than changing the rules for
 
04:13:32.150 --> 04:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
vacation time earned after a change I
 
04:13:33.769 --> 04:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
have a lot of concern about just pulling
 
04:13:34.969 --> 04:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
the rug on different businesses and
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
saying previously that was not a you
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
know liability you hit list had to list
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
on your balance sheet because you didn't
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
have to pay it out according to law but
 
04:13:44.689 --> 04:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you know somebody may
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
have had a month of vacation time banked
 
04:13:49.130 --> 04:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
and new rules on that that bank not just
 
04:13:51.650 --> 04:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
the new time earned so I'll be voting
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
for the itl motion for that reason in
 
04:13:53.460 --> 04:13:55.189 align:start position:0%
for the itl motion for that reason in
addition

04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
addition
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
04:14:02.570 --> 04:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh let me just
 
04:14:04.130 --> 04:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
counter some of the statements
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
previously made
 
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
most recently the statement about the
 
04:14:10.849 --> 04:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
retroactive well it might be it might be
 
04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
a concern although one thinks that the
 
04:14:17.689 --> 04:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
employer has every intention of having
 
04:14:20.590 --> 04:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
the vacation taken and and paid for
 
04:14:23.689 --> 04:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
during the course of employment so it
 
04:14:25.370 --> 04:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really be an unrecognized and
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
unanticipated atom on the balance sheet
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
the vacation is offered with the intent
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
that it will be used
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh as for the
 
04:14:38.530 --> 04:14:38.540 align:start position:0%
other concern
 
04:14:41.450 --> 04:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
if we passed if we were to pass this law
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
then businesses would be on notice that
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
when they are selling they would not be
 
04:14:49.370 --> 04:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
closing up and screwing off until they
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
had native arrangements to transfer the
 
04:14:53.450 --> 04:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
out the vacation hours or pay the
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
employee that's the purpose of the law
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:03.530 --> 04:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
did I see another hand down
 
04:15:06.530 --> 04:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Sullivan
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
simply put I'm going to be voting no on
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
the itl because I'm dying to see the
 
04:15:16.929 --> 04:15:16.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.729 --> 04:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
representative Granger
 
04:15:24.410 --> 04:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
I think Mr Mr chairs yes um so my I'm
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
going to be in favor of the itl um I
 
04:15:27.769 --> 04:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
believe it's unethical for legislators
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
to interfere with private contracts
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of companies in New
 
04:15:32.929 --> 04:15:32.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who don't have a regular PTO
 
04:15:36.110 --> 04:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
system that this bill is kind of aiming
 
04:15:38.929 --> 04:15:38.939 align:start position:0%
at and uh if it is a private contract
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't work in the one size fits
 
04:15:43.550 --> 04:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
all fashion that this bill sort of cuts
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
out then uh it's really going to change
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
the dynamic in a lot of workplaces and
 
04:15:49.969 --> 04:15:49.979 align:start position:0%
have very broad reaching effects across
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
a wide variety of industries that we
 
04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
cannot foresee so we already enforce
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
labor contracts as agreed to so there's
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
really no point um if if there is a if
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's a company that's not abiding by
 
04:16:03.410 --> 04:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
their labor contract that's already
 
04:16:04.610 --> 04:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
enforced we don't need to change
 
04:16:04.620 --> 04:16:06.710 align:start position:0%
enforced we don't need to change
anything

04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:16:06.720 --> 04:16:09.050 align:start position:0%

if there is no one else who wishes to

04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%

so the motion on the floor is ought to
 
04:18:10.210 --> 04:18:10.220 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me introducing Amendment
 
04:18:13.849 --> 04:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
2023-03788 it's been moved Cahill
 
04:18:16.370 --> 04:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
seconded by Sullivan
 
04:18:19.309 --> 04:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
the other floor thank you Mr chair
 
04:18:19.319 --> 04:18:20.870 align:start position:0%
the other floor thank you Mr chair
uh

04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:24.110 --> 04:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment is is uh narrowing the the
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
original Bill quite a bit and now we're
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
not covering the people who leave a job
 
04:18:34.189 --> 04:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh on good terms uh perhaps you know
 
04:18:35.809 --> 04:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
they could have any number of reasons
 
04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
reasons for leaving but they they under
 
04:18:40.010 --> 04:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
this with this amendment they will leave
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
behind in the unused vacation if that's
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
the policy of the employer for many
 
04:18:46.729 --> 04:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state that is not the
 
04:18:48.769 --> 04:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
policy and they would pay out what is
 
04:18:51.969 --> 04:18:51.979 align:start position:0%
earned in fact earned vacation time
 
04:18:54.290 --> 04:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
however we're not going to do that here
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
what we what we removed that section and
 
04:19:00.170 --> 04:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
now we are only going to insist that the
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
workers unused and on your earned and
 
04:19:05.210 --> 04:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
unused time be paid
 
04:19:07.490 --> 04:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
upon termination when the result when
 
04:19:09.650 --> 04:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
this is the result of the layoff when no
 
04:19:14.210 --> 04:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
when each one is a change of ownership
 
04:19:20.929 --> 04:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
and the the business will then either
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
transfer the uh unused time to the new
 
04:19:25.080 --> 04:19:26.990 align:start position:0%
transfer the uh unused time to the new
employer

04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:19:29.330 --> 04:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
or pay the employee
 
04:19:31.250 --> 04:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is something that we have that's
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
been identified by several people as
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable that's the right thing to do
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
these are the described by someone
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
familiar to this committee as being
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
egregious events that shouldn't happen
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
in this state and yet they do if we do
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
not pass this amendment and this bill
 
04:19:51.590 --> 04:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
this happens it's reported to the labor
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
department you know and if it happens to
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
someone else after we've had this
 
04:19:58.490 --> 04:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at this bill it will
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
be on us
 
04:19:59.640 --> 04:20:01.429 align:start position:0%
be on us
uh

04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:03.889 --> 04:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
I mean I when I when my wife and I first
 
04:20:06.050 --> 04:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
became involved with the making strides
 
04:20:07.969 --> 04:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
Against Breast Cancer they had the
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
slogan you or someone you know
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
and certainly that applies we have no
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
idea when cancer is coming we have no
 
04:20:16.910 --> 04:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
idea when the layoff is coming uh the
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
employer will not usually tell you when
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
he's going to sell the business or that
 
04:20:21.889 --> 04:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
you will lose your time
 
04:20:24.170 --> 04:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
these are events that are unplanned but
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
beyond the control of the employee and
 
04:20:28.729 --> 04:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
they should not forfeit the time that
 
04:20:30.769 --> 04:20:30.779 align:start position:0%
they have earned it should be
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
transferred in the event of a sale in
 
04:20:35.570 --> 04:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
the business or they should be paid
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cahill
 
04:20:44.090 --> 04:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative avalani
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I thank the
 
04:20:48.410 --> 04:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative for the clarification on
 
04:20:50.929 --> 04:20:50.939 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:20:50.939 --> 04:20:51.530 align:start position:0%
the amendment
um

04:20:51.530 --> 04:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
line six and seven
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
um what if the employee goes back to
 
04:20:57.769 --> 04:20:57.779 align:start position:0%
work after 12 weeks
 
04:21:00.110 --> 04:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
for some of the seasonals
 
04:21:02.929 --> 04:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
things only work seven months or even
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
some of them even six months and they
 
04:21:06.530 --> 04:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
want to hold their
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
vacation time or in time to when they
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
come back or when they want to build it
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
up to the company or maybe they going
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
from seasonal employee to a permanent
 
04:21:16.429 --> 04:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
employee I mean could they
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
how does that work with them
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the 11 weeks was chosen because that's
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
the number that the Department of
 
04:21:27.769 --> 04:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
Employment Security uses to say that if
 
04:21:30.769 --> 04:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
you if you're not due back at work with
 
04:21:33.309 --> 04:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
11 weeks but I think in the real world
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the real world there would be an
 
04:21:38.570 --> 04:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
understanding uh that you yes it will
 
04:21:40.490 --> 04:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
not it's not necessarily a certain date
 
04:21:42.290 --> 04:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's not April 2nd
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh or the third Monday in in June it's
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know when conditions and and it's a
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
day the target date so that is there's
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
an understanding between the employer
 
04:21:54.410 --> 04:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
and the employee that yes you'll be
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
coming back to work if that doesn't
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
happen and only if that doesn't happen
 
04:22:01.969 --> 04:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
would the employee be contacting the
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
labor department to say this was not the
 
04:22:07.370 --> 04:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
plan and I would like to receive my
 
04:22:15.889 --> 04:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
lower yes
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:22:20.880 --> 04:22:22.610 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you

04:22:22.610 --> 04:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't they contact the
 
04:22:26.290 --> 04:22:26.300 align:start position:0%
employer if they were
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
expecting to be out longer than the 11
 
04:22:28.680 --> 04:22:30.170 align:start position:0%
expecting to be out longer than the 11
weeks

04:22:30.170 --> 04:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
clarification what I mean is when you
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
are laid off from a Paving Company or or
 
04:22:37.560 --> 04:22:38.330 align:start position:0%
are laid off from a Paving Company or or
Etc

04:22:38.330 --> 04:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
and they say well we expect you back
 
04:22:43.610 --> 04:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
when this happens or this time this
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
month you know in this period and and
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna you have the option of
 
04:22:49.080 --> 04:22:50.809 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna you have the option of
uh

04:22:50.809 --> 04:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
if you agree that that's what's going to
 
04:22:54.050 --> 04:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
happen we're not going to pay you a
 
04:22:56.450 --> 04:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
vacation it's a
 
04:22:59.090 --> 04:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
who hold on to it and continue to when
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
you resume work you'll have that
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
vacation time for use
 
04:23:06.290 --> 04:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
but if it doesn't happen
 
04:23:08.330 --> 04:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
if the employer doesn't call you back
 
04:23:10.370 --> 04:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
and you you reach out to them and they
 
04:23:12.290 --> 04:23:12.300 align:start position:0%
say well we're not going we're not going
 
04:23:13.729 --> 04:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
to be able to hire you back something
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
else is going on this is when you would
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
say to them well we had an agreement and
 
04:23:20.570 --> 04:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
I can go to the labor department and
 
04:23:30.290 --> 04:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:38.330 --> 04:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
um we are just so you know
 
04:23:41.929 --> 04:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
um we no no we have no time concerns and
 
04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
Rudy Ogden will be here in about 10 or
 
04:23:46.610 --> 04:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
15 minutes so just
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna go the same Pace we're
 
04:23:50.450 --> 04:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
going thank you um so that that would
 
04:23:52.729 --> 04:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
become a layoff with no return date so
 
04:23:53.809 --> 04:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
that would follow under the first
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
sentence five and six
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that would be there would be do
 
04:24:00.530 --> 04:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
their wages due at the end of that
 
04:24:02.330 --> 04:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
following week that they're apprised of
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
their permanent layoff or
 
04:24:08.210 --> 04:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
their separation because of non does not
 
04:24:11.090 --> 04:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
work right thank you if they if they do
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
not return to work as anticipated then
 
04:24:15.889 --> 04:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
the wages then the earned vacation would
 
04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
be due
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I I also ran this by
 
04:24:23.689 --> 04:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
of the department and it is workable
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
they understand it it's workable from
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions on the amendment or
 
04:24:45.769 --> 04:24:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by
 
04:24:47.399 --> 04:24:50.389 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by
avaloni

04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
I support the amendment
 
04:24:56.150 --> 04:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I also support the hard work that
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill has put in in
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a formulation
 
04:25:06.290 --> 04:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
here that is more palatable and um
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
I I just uh I think he's he's bent over
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
backwards to try to find something that
 
04:25:14.750 --> 04:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
would work that would uh provide some um
 
04:25:18.170 --> 04:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
Equity to uh
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
um workers who have uh their vacation
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
snatched up from under them by no fault
 
04:25:26.750 --> 04:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
of their own and he's continuously tried
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
to uh adjust and amend
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
um to make this work and I hope we can
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
get there on at least on this amendment
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.450 --> 04:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you um again back to line six and
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
seven that we're requiring employees and
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
employer and employee agrees in writing
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
that the employer pulled the payment
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
pending the earlier of their return or
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
to work or 11 weeks so now we're
 
04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
requiring another mandate on employers
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
to have all of these agreements in place
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
in case they do come back to work or
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't come back to work do we know how
 
04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
many employers or employees and how much
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr adolani uh
 
04:26:16.370 --> 04:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
there is already a requirement that for
 
04:26:19.370 --> 04:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
those who have vacation accrued that
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
when they when the employee borrows a
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
few days or a week and then leaves the
 
04:26:25.319 --> 04:26:26.290 align:start position:0%
few days or a week and then leaves the
company

04:26:26.290 --> 04:26:26.300 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:26:29.389 --> 04:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
if the employer hasn't asked them to
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
sign an agreement that they that amount
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
will be reduced from their final check
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
the employer the employer can't recoup
 
04:26:39.710 --> 04:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
that money so it's
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
it's really just another sort of
 
04:26:44.689 --> 04:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
protective you're you're sure you're by
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
by agreeing that you want the person
 
04:26:46.920 --> 04:26:48.229 align:start position:0%
by agreeing that you want the person
back

04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
and saying I yeah this is I'm serious I
 
04:26:52.130 --> 04:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
want you to come back I don't want you
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
to go and get another job and leave here
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
I want you to come back your vacation
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
will be waiting for you
 
04:26:58.969 --> 04:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
uh you're kind of helping your retention
 
04:26:58.979 --> 04:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
uh you're kind of helping your retention
rate

04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:27:02.689 --> 04:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know an understanding
 
04:27:04.370 --> 04:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
between the employer and employee which
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
we think should be a good relationship
 
04:27:10.490 --> 04:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
if for some reason things change then
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
the employee the employee does not
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
forfeit that which he has earned he it
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
can be he can reclaim it
 
04:27:20.330 --> 04:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to get to with
 
04:27:21.769 --> 04:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
this and I guess the temporary and the
 
04:27:25.070 --> 04:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
seasonal was yet another complication uh
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
and I think we agree that when when you
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
don't quit the job you don't uh set the
 
04:27:32.330 --> 04:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
place on fire punch the boss and then I
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
was uh even give notice and train your
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
new help uh well at this point if it's
 
04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
not beyond your control you really
 
04:27:43.849 --> 04:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
should get what you earned and they
 
04:27:46.849 --> 04:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
should be viewed as wages
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
not in other states nearby they have
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
none of these technicalities you just
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
get what you had on the books regardless
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
if you did punch the Boston in those
 
04:27:57.769 --> 04:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
which I don't recommend no
 
04:27:59.450 --> 04:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
04:28:02.809 --> 04:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh thank you for that
 
04:28:05.809 --> 04:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
elaboration the the question I have is
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
does every employer have to get that in
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
writing from every employee even though
 
04:28:11.210 --> 04:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
they are due back work because this is
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
mandating a written policy
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
for each employee to sign that the
 
04:28:18.170 --> 04:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
employer can hold on to there
 
04:28:19.729 --> 04:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
vacation okay so it's going to be
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
another layer of HR work to enforce this
 
04:28:26.450 --> 04:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the employee can't go
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the labor department in eight weeks
 
04:28:29.929 --> 04:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
and say hey I didn't get my
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't get my vacation pay even though
 
04:28:33.649 --> 04:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
it says it in the law but I signed a
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
paper and they they forced me to sign a
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
paper but I'm back to work next week
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of just want to make sure
 
04:28:41.090 --> 04:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of the business as well as
 
04:28:44.450 --> 04:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
taking care of the employees
 
04:28:46.729 --> 04:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr avaland I I assure your
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
concern uh this is intended for those
 
04:28:52.849 --> 04:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
seasonal temporary situations which we
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
know are frequent and and it really is
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
not a a terribly arduous layer of just
 
04:29:01.849 --> 04:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
we had the we had the employer sign the
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
employee handbook we have the employee
 
04:29:07.370 --> 04:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh sign all manner of things when
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
something changes and this is
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated they know that they're going
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
to stop Paving or whatever it is they're
 
04:29:16.969 --> 04:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
doing construction wise when weather
 
04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
conditions uh prohibited so it's it's
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
not really uh it's not really a brand
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
new thing it's just a way of documenting
 
04:29:27.530 --> 04:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
what was the plan
 
04:29:30.110 --> 04:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
and it gives the opportunity for the
 
04:29:33.050 --> 04:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
employee to recoup if the plan falls
 
04:29:33.060 --> 04:29:36.050 align:start position:0%
employee to recoup if the plan falls
through

04:29:36.050 --> 04:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:40.729 --> 04:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.530 --> 04:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
all right seeing there's no other hands
 
04:29:44.330 --> 04:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask you folks for a
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
minute or two
 
04:29:46.199 --> 04:29:47.389 align:start position:0%
minute or two
um

04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:50.090 --> 04:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
the clerk is out with Rudy Ogden
 
04:29:52.250 --> 04:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
explaining it so he can read it and
 
04:29:54.050 --> 04:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
while we're finishing up the business on
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
this one
 
04:29:57.649 --> 04:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
but I can't call the roll because she's
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
not here
 
04:30:02.689 --> 04:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
it is time for a bathroom break
 
04:30:05.330 --> 04:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
or water break please come back as soon
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
but the but the gallery you have to stay
 
04:30:25.330 --> 04:30:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take out it only takes out
 
04:30:33.370 --> 04:30:33.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.170 --> 04:30:47.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
correct one state oh yeah yeah it makes
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.560 --> 04:30:58.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:30:58.450 --> 04:30:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
so you're right but what you're saying
 
04:31:03.410 --> 04:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
is you thought this replacement yeah no
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
it just replaces five a can I ask on
 
04:31:24.349 --> 04:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:24.359 --> 04:35:48.789 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:35:48.789 --> 04:35:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman before we move
 
04:35:54.410 --> 04:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
on if you have any questions on the
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
amendment uh Mr Ogden is in the house uh
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
this is Mr Juve
 
04:35:59.879 --> 04:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
this is Mr Juve
well

04:36:01.310 --> 04:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:36:01.320 --> 04:36:02.510 align:start position:0%
well
um

04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
this one I don't think is a policy
 
04:36:07.010 --> 04:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a policy thing not so
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
much a understanding of the amendment uh
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
I believe uh representative there's two
 
04:36:14.269 --> 04:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
other uh questions representative
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
abalani followed by representative Prout
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
okay experiment uh thank you again
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
um just so I'm clear
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
um this is not replacing the original
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill it's only repricing section VA it's
 
04:36:29.330 --> 04:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
redefining VA under paragraph two it's
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
not removing the first part of your
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
original bill that is correct so the
 
04:36:34.849 --> 04:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
fresh by the original bill will stay
 
04:36:37.849 --> 04:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
part of the bill yes thank you
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative probe
 
04:36:42.490 --> 04:36:42.500 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh representative Cahill
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
how would this work if this
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know again regarding effective
 
04:36:49.250 --> 04:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
date and how the transition Works how
 
04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
would this work if when this became
 
04:36:52.369 --> 04:36:52.379 align:start position:0%
effective If This Were to pass and
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
become effective someone was in the
 
04:36:57.289 --> 04:36:57.299 align:start position:0%
middle of a layoff waiting there uh you
 
04:36:58.849 --> 04:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
know return to work 10 weeks out would
 
04:37:00.890 --> 04:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
it would if they had previously agreed
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
the navigation be time be held over
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
whether that then all of a sudden be a
 
04:37:07.010 --> 04:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
requirement to pay it out on the spot I
 
04:37:08.631 --> 04:37:08.641 align:start position:0%
mean how would it work if it just became
 
04:37:11.090 --> 04:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
an effective while the business was in
 
04:37:13.310 --> 04:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
the middle of this temporary layoff
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Pratt that's an interesting
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
question and I think
 
04:37:19.970 --> 04:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
I think if the employer and employee did
 
04:37:22.250 --> 04:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
not work it out themselves they could
 
04:37:23.570 --> 04:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
certainly contact the New Hampshire
 
04:37:25.789 --> 04:37:25.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor who would be able to
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
04:37:29.631 --> 04:37:29.641 align:start position:0%
they would whether no with the if the
 
04:37:32.810 --> 04:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
law had taken effect if that was if that
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
was for the situation we're at the
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
midpoint they would know how to
 
04:37:41.650 --> 04:37:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.250 --> 04:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
so we don't know right now uh what the
 
04:37:48.170 --> 04:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor would say to
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
somebody they contact in that situation
 
04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh we might we might ask someone from
 
04:37:55.310 --> 04:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor who's here if
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
he'd like to care if he'd care to
 
04:38:00.051 --> 04:38:00.061 align:start position:0%
extrapolate on what may happen if this
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
happened and that happened and it wasn't
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
raining on a Tuesday in November
 
04:38:11.570 --> 04:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't think my day was going to be
 
04:38:15.529 --> 04:38:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:15.539 --> 04:38:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:38:19.010 --> 04:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's all right are there any other
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
questions about the amendments
 
04:38:21.959 --> 04:38:42.970 align:start position:0%
questions about the amendments
foreign

04:38:42.970 --> 04:38:42.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:45.529 --> 04:38:45.539 align:start position:0%
we have to wait
 
04:38:46.730 --> 04:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
um we need
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.699 --> 04:38:58.609 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

04:38:58.609 --> 04:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
04:39:14.209 --> 04:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.219 --> 04:39:17.029 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.250 --> 04:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
this is just to adopt the amendment
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment just adopt the amendment
 
04:39:21.840 --> 04:39:25.369 align:start position:0%
Amendment just adopt the amendment

04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay if you want so this is yeah so the
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
motion is to adopt the amendment the
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
clerk will call the role if you're in
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%

04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:40:36.050 --> 04:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
um I would like to move ought to pass on
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
um as it was originally presented
 
04:40:43.368 --> 04:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is odd to pass a
 
04:40:45.650 --> 04:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
Sullivan second by
 
04:40:50.090 --> 04:40:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.650 --> 04:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
I was hoping for discussion we have the
 
04:40:51.660 --> 04:40:53.230 align:start position:0%
I was hoping for discussion we have the
foreign

04:40:53.230 --> 04:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think we beat it to death
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
I think rep Cahill made every effort to
 
04:41:01.250 --> 04:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate some concerns
 
04:41:01.260 --> 04:41:01.970 align:start position:0%
uh accommodate some concerns
um

04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
apparently he did not hit the mark
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
however I still believe it's a good bill
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
um we've been working for a long time to
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
try to preserve the earn time for people
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
who by no fault of their own have lost
 
04:41:19.970 --> 04:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
employment and also lost that earned
 
04:41:19.980 --> 04:41:21.170 align:start position:0%
employment and also lost that earned
time

04:41:21.170 --> 04:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I believe I believed it was a
 
04:41:25.310 --> 04:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
good bill to start with I believe rep
 
04:41:28.368 --> 04:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
Cahill worked hard to try to make it
 
04:41:31.368 --> 04:41:31.378 align:start position:0%
more palatable as I said but I will
 
04:41:32.990 --> 04:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
still vote in favor of what I believe
 
04:41:38.030 --> 04:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.490 --> 04:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:41:42.410 --> 04:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative kale
 
04:41:45.530 --> 04:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh indeed it was a
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
good bill uh the amendment does improve
 
04:41:52.850 --> 04:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
it and if we end up with a 10 10 I will
 
04:41:54.410 --> 04:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
certainly bring the floor Amendment to
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the floor where I believe it will pass
 
04:41:59.090 --> 04:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
because there are people
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the larger body who will support this
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
it's been done before
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
and I believe it will happen again thank
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:14.810 --> 04:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
are there any other kind any other
 
04:42:14.820 --> 04:42:16.250 align:start position:0%
are there any other kind any other
comments

04:42:16.250 --> 04:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
No Doubt uh representative Sullivan that
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative KL has worked very hard
 
04:42:24.170 --> 04:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
for a number of years
 
04:42:28.010 --> 04:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
and one of the the issues
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:42:30.600 --> 04:42:33.288 align:start position:0%
is that
representative

04:42:33.288 --> 04:42:33.298 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
the issues is that the concerning of a
 
04:42:38.030 --> 04:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
vacation time and some of these other
 
04:42:41.330 --> 04:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
things that are offered to employees
 
04:42:41.340 --> 04:42:43.368 align:start position:0%
things that are offered to employees
um

04:42:43.368 --> 04:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:46.128 --> 04:42:46.138 align:start position:0%
they are perks there are benefits to
 
04:42:49.128 --> 04:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
keep employees happier to to we could do
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
we want them to be rested we don't want
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
them to come in and when they're sick
 
04:42:54.170 --> 04:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
all these different things are decisions
 
04:42:55.730 --> 04:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
that employers make
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
and and the issue I've always had from
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
the beginning is at a certain point it
 
04:43:01.610 --> 04:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
has to it has to be cash on the
 
04:43:03.050 --> 04:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
barrelhead and that's not necessarily
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
what business owners think of that there
 
04:43:09.650 --> 04:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
are situations where businesses earn two
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
weeks pay people have waited you know
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks vacation time they've waited
 
04:43:15.890 --> 04:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
till the second of January and they quit
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they say you know
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
maybe two weeks and
 
04:43:22.250 --> 04:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
and putting this into wages where they
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
have to be presented in or pay within a
 
04:43:25.320 --> 04:43:26.868 align:start position:0%
have to be presented in or pay within a
week

04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
um I just
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:43:33.230 --> 04:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
businesses need to be able to have the
 
04:43:33.240 --> 04:43:34.850 align:start position:0%
businesses need to be able to have the
decision

04:43:34.850 --> 04:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
um to
 
04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
present what they want in their employee
 
04:43:40.368 --> 04:43:40.378 align:start position:0%
manual I had an employee that I hired
 
04:43:41.530 --> 04:43:41.540 align:start position:0%
from another
 
04:43:44.090 --> 04:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
employer years ago
 
04:43:46.970 --> 04:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
and he refused to pay her
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
the remaining week in her vacation pay
 
04:43:53.090 --> 04:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
and she was upset about it she showed me
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
the employee manual I accompanied her to
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor hearing
 
04:43:59.570 --> 04:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
and she won
 
04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
and rightly so
 
04:44:01.378 --> 04:44:02.690 align:start position:0%
and rightly so
because

04:44:02.690 --> 04:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
there was nothing in the employee manual
 
04:44:05.930 --> 04:44:05.940 align:start position:0%

04:44:11.208 --> 04:44:11.218 align:start position:0%

head for any number of potential reasons
 
04:44:15.170 --> 04:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
that would happen is just too much for

we're discussing
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment brought in by representative
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
Schultz and I would like to call
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
assistant Commissioner Rudy Ogden from
 
04:45:52.368 --> 04:45:52.378 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor to shed some
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
light on the
 
04:45:54.718 --> 04:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
light on the
uh

04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:58.570 --> 04:45:58.580 align:start position:0%
confusion that
 
04:46:02.050 --> 04:46:02.060 align:start position:0%
the different opinions of what the the
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
amendment may or may not do you've had
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to look at the amendment
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
I have nice
 
04:46:10.910 --> 04:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
um would you like to make a statement on
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
just the amendment uh I understand
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're not making a policy uh comments
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
um or what would you like to hear
 
04:46:20.570 --> 04:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
questions of from the
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee so I would start uh
 
04:46:24.890 --> 04:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
just uh for the record Rudy Ogden Deputy
 
04:46:27.170 --> 04:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Department of Labor I had
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
had conversations with representative
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
Schultz relative to her Amendment my
 
04:46:32.810 --> 04:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
understanding is the intent of what she
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
was trying to do was hone in on uh
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
removing the concept of sub minimum for
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
tipped employees and what we had then
 
04:46:42.890 --> 04:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
talked about was the fact that in
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
addition to a sub minimum for tipped
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
employees if you look at the language of
 
04:46:49.610 --> 04:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
RSA 279 21 what it does is it says okay
 
04:46:52.368 --> 04:46:52.378 align:start position:0%
there's going to be uh this idea that
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
people are going to be paid at least the
 
04:46:56.448 --> 04:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage it then carves out
 
04:46:58.850 --> 04:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
a category and says directly tipped
 
04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
employees will be able to be paid a sub
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and then it says that and
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
in addition to that there's a whole host
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
of folks who are again not subject to
 
04:47:10.368 --> 04:47:10.378 align:start position:0%
the limitations again they are not
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to be paid a minimum
 
04:47:15.650 --> 04:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
wage such as caddies uh ski patrolman
 
04:47:18.650 --> 04:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
things of that nature my understanding
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
of what this amendment would do upon
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
review of it is that it's leaving those
 
04:47:26.208 --> 04:47:26.218 align:start position:0%
subsidiary exceptions in it's taking out
 
04:47:28.010 --> 04:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the introductory paragraph the
 
04:47:30.288 --> 04:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
reference to tipped employees so it's
 
04:47:32.448 --> 04:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
saying everyone's going to be paid the
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is set forth by federal
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
standard and then it says there are
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
those certain exceptions with the colon
 
04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
and then that list remains I would
 
04:47:43.610 --> 04:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that there is a than
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
a secondary if you look for in the
 
04:47:48.410 --> 04:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
existing language and apologies that I
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
pull it up on my phone but if you look
 
04:47:52.430 --> 04:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
at the existing language of Statute I
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
guess some confusion didn't come up
 
04:47:55.850 --> 04:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
relative to seasonal employees and
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
things of that nature what that's saying
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
is it's saying that there are employees
 
04:48:03.410 --> 04:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh who if they're covered by the
 
04:48:05.390 --> 04:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph So basically
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
everybody but the exceptions like
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
caddies and newspaper uh salesmen things
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
of that nature that if they work over 40
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
hours they're entitled to an overtime
 
04:48:19.730 --> 04:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
premium that's what that language is
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
doing I'm happy to take questions if
 
04:48:23.330 --> 04:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
there's specific uh questions on that
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
but I want to be clear that this
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
amendment would not impact who is is
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
subject to or entitled to the overtime
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
premium I don't believe that the way
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
that this is framed would alter or
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
affect that
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good to see you
 
04:48:46.670 --> 04:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
again uh commissioner Ogden
 
04:48:46.680 --> 04:48:48.230 align:start position:0%
again uh commissioner Ogden
um

04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:50.930 --> 04:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
the question that I have is
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
on line seven it says subject to the
 
04:48:55.490 --> 04:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
following exceptions except under 279
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
colon 21 there's two paragraphs that say
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
04:49:01.730 --> 04:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
subject to the following exceptions and
 
04:49:03.230 --> 04:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
then subject to the following exceptions
 
04:49:05.570 --> 04:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
so which paragraph is it removing or is
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
removing bolts
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
I would believe
 
04:49:12.890 --> 04:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's removing both in the sense of the
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
reason there's those two paragraphs now
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
is last session or perhaps it may have
 
04:49:19.610 --> 04:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
been two sessions ago there was an
 
04:49:21.890 --> 04:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
amendment which said if there's an uh
 
04:49:23.448 --> 04:49:23.458 align:start position:0%
change at the federal level because
 
04:49:25.490 --> 04:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
remember New Hampshire doesn't have its
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
only its own explicitly stated minimum
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
wage we tracked to the FED minimum wage
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
so a couple uh
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
sessions ago they had put in this idea
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
that if the federal minimum wage changes
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
that the sub minimum rate would not
 
04:49:44.530 --> 04:49:44.540 align:start position:0%
track to that it would have said cap at
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
327. that does not take effect though
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
unless and until the federal minimum
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
wage changes
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
I believe that this amendment as
 
04:49:55.730 --> 04:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
presented would essentially replace both
 
04:49:57.410 --> 04:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
of those paragraphs because there would
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
not then be a sub minimum wage for
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
tipped employees if that makes sense I
 
04:50:03.890 --> 04:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm being clear but again
 
04:50:05.510 --> 04:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the reason there's
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
those two paragraphs is one comes into
 
04:50:10.310 --> 04:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
play saying that if the feds change
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
their minimum wage the state will still
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
have its sub minimum rate capped at 327.
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is removing the idea or concept of
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
sub minimum for tipped employees so both
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
paragraphs go away and then what you're
 
04:50:25.970 --> 04:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
then left with is just an introductory
 
04:50:28.128 --> 04:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
paragraph that says everyone's getting
 
04:50:30.890 --> 04:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
paid the federal minimum wage subject to
 
04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
the following exceptions this amendment
 
04:50:35.330 --> 04:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any of those existing
 
04:50:35.340 --> 04:50:39.770 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any of those existing
exceptions

04:50:39.770 --> 04:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:39.780 --> 04:50:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:50:44.990 --> 04:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.628 --> 04:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
while you're thinking I'm going to call
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
and look at the clerk or representative
 
04:50:52.970 --> 04:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you actually I was gonna I
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:50:54.120 --> 04:50:55.448 align:start position:0%
know that
um

04:50:55.448 --> 04:50:55.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:57.890 --> 04:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative avaloni had a question
 
04:51:00.770 --> 04:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
about in this section that would remain
 
04:51:03.050 --> 04:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
04:51:03.060 --> 04:51:03.830 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
um

04:51:03.830 --> 04:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:07.490 --> 04:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
the section addressing overtime so
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's section eight
 
04:51:10.320 --> 04:51:13.190 align:start position:0%
that's section eight
under

04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:15.770 --> 04:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
the existing you know you have your
 
04:51:17.448 --> 04:51:17.458 align:start position:0%
carve outs and then you have a
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
description about overtime
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
and if that would
 
04:51:21.958 --> 04:51:23.690 align:start position:0%
and if that would
be

04:51:23.690 --> 04:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
to go into effect now for tip wage
 
04:51:26.878 --> 04:51:28.250 align:start position:0%
to go into effect now for tip wage
workers

04:51:28.250 --> 04:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
my impression is that already is the law
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
is that true yes that's true correct
 
04:51:39.288 --> 04:51:39.298 align:start position:0%
that the the language in in Section 8 is
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
saying that those folks covered by the
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph under existing
 
04:51:45.890 --> 04:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
law or under this amendment they would
 
04:51:49.070 --> 04:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
also be entitled to an overtime premium
 
04:51:51.230 --> 04:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
so again the Department's reading of
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
this amendment is that that would not be
 
04:51:57.288 --> 04:51:57.298 align:start position:0%
a change under this proposed legislation
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and just because I am confused
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
Section 8 applies to currently all
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
hourly employees so the the language of
 
04:52:13.128 --> 04:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
Section 8 is saying anyone who is
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
covered under the initial paragraph is
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
entitled to this so yes it would
 
04:52:20.448 --> 04:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
typically be your hourly employees it'd
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
be basically anybody who's working if
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
you look at the language of 279 21 now
 
04:52:27.650 --> 04:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's saying if you're working uh you're
 
04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to at least federal minimum
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
wage for All Hours worked
 
04:52:34.250 --> 04:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
subject to the following exceptions and
 
04:52:36.288 --> 04:52:36.298 align:start position:0%
then this Section 8 says if you're
 
04:52:38.448 --> 04:52:38.458 align:start position:0%
covered by that introductory paragraph
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you're not subject to those
 
04:52:42.650 --> 04:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
exceptions then for any hour over 40
 
04:52:48.610 --> 04:52:48.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative bogert followed by
 
04:52:52.680 --> 04:52:53.930 align:start position:0%
uh representative bogert followed by
avaloni

04:52:53.930 --> 04:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
avaloni
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:53:00.590 --> 04:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
so if I understand this correctly uh the
 
04:53:02.750 --> 04:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire minimum wage would
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
disappear and the federal minimum wage
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
would take precedence and if that's so
 
04:53:11.448 --> 04:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
then would that also have an adverse
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
effect on the uh
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
tipped wage earners because now they're
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
making minimum wage and they wouldn't
 
04:53:22.850 --> 04:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be tipped
 
04:53:25.368 --> 04:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
so present laws that there is not a New
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire minimum wage New Hampshire for
 
04:53:30.170 --> 04:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
purposes of minimum wage law says that
 
04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
we track to the federal whatever the
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
feds establishes the minimum wage that's
 
04:53:37.128 --> 04:53:37.138 align:start position:0%
what we're tracking to so this that's
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
existing law and that would be the law
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
um and thank you again commissioner
 
04:53:48.958 --> 04:53:50.090 align:start position:0%
um and thank you again commissioner
Ogden

04:53:50.090 --> 04:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
Ogden
 
04:53:50.100 --> 04:53:51.910 align:start position:0%
Ogden
um

04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
so there's a classification of
 
04:53:56.810 --> 04:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
employment according to the iOS for
 
04:53:58.788 --> 04:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
chipped employees which requires a sub
 
04:54:00.890 --> 04:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
04:54:03.470 --> 04:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
this would reclassify those employees as
 
04:54:06.650 --> 04:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
04:54:10.610 --> 04:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the IRS there's a
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
nationally compulsion that people
 
04:54:14.448 --> 04:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
classify and employ a sub minimum or
 
04:54:16.368 --> 04:54:16.378 align:start position:0%
tipped I think instead how it works is
 
04:54:18.650 --> 04:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
that you are as an employer entitled in
 
04:54:21.288 --> 04:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
certain instances to pay someone who
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
could be deemed a tipped employee less
 
04:54:25.490 --> 04:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
than minimum wage so I don't again and
 
04:54:28.430 --> 04:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not an IRS expert but I I do not
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
believe that it's a matter of the IRS
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
saying those are tipped employees and
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
have to be paid less you would always be
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
entitled to pay them more it's just in
 
04:54:39.050 --> 04:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
certain instances you are entitled to
 
04:54:41.448 --> 04:54:41.458 align:start position:0%
pay them less than minimum wage provided
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
that they meet the standard set forth in
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
federal law or in this case state law
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
oh hold on the New Hampshire doesn't
 
04:54:51.410 --> 04:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
have an income tax
 
04:54:53.930 --> 04:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
so there'd be no mechanism for an hourly
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
employer for an hourly employee to
 
04:54:58.610 --> 04:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
retain wages
 
04:55:00.590 --> 04:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
or to claim wages above their hourly
 
04:55:00.600 --> 04:55:02.150 align:start position:0%
or to claim wages above their hourly
employment

04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:55:04.610 --> 04:55:04.620 align:start position:0%
would that be correct I'm not sure I'm
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
understanding the question I apologize
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
a tipped employee makes 327 an hour
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
they're made employers and employees are
 
04:55:15.730 --> 04:55:15.740 align:start position:0%
incredibly mandated to require
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
withholding of wages which is their
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
tipped employee the tip wages were
 
04:55:22.128 --> 04:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
required to
 
04:55:24.170 --> 04:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
report them
 
04:55:26.690 --> 04:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
if we no longer for hourly employees you
 
04:55:29.448 --> 04:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
no longer have that ability to withhold
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
weight withhold tips because technically
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're no longer a tipped employee
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're now an hourly employee
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
so with the Department of Labor we
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
classify that and change the definition
 
04:55:45.288 --> 04:55:45.298 align:start position:0%
of 178 colon 20-a which defines tipped
 
04:55:45.298 --> 04:55:46.930 align:start position:0%
of 178 colon 20-a which defines tipped
employees

04:55:46.930 --> 04:55:46.940 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:55:49.970 --> 04:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
without trying to make I believe that
 
04:55:51.650 --> 04:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
they're both tipped and hourly and what
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
I mean by that is even under existing
 
04:55:55.670 --> 04:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
law someone who works as a server
 
04:55:58.430 --> 04:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're being paid an hourly rate
 
04:56:01.970 --> 04:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
and if they get 30 or more of tips for a
 
04:56:04.490 --> 04:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
month directly from customers under our
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
law they could also be deemed a tipped
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
employee so they're both hourly in tip
 
04:56:10.368 --> 04:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
so I'm not necessarily understanding
 
04:56:11.930 --> 04:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
that distinction in terms of what's
 
04:56:14.690 --> 04:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
being reported or withheld they should
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
be reporting their wages they should be
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
reporting their tips the employer should
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
be taking out deductions uh relative to
 
04:56:24.530 --> 04:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
that so I don't know that this
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily changes any of that but
 
04:56:29.030 --> 04:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
again I might be missing the point
 
04:56:31.368 --> 04:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
apologies for that
 
04:56:31.378 --> 04:56:36.890 align:start position:0%
apologies for that
foreign

04:56:36.890 --> 04:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.470 --> 04:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
it removes those two paragraphs that
 
04:56:42.050 --> 04:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
allows withholdings for
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
tipped wages because we're no longer
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
having a sub minimum wage
 
04:56:49.850 --> 04:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
as an employer I am not obligated or I
 
04:56:49.860 --> 04:56:51.170 align:start position:0%
as an employer I am not obligated or I
can

04:56:51.170 --> 04:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:56:52.730 --> 04:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
Force an employee to tell me how much
 
04:56:54.470 --> 04:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
they make over an hourly rate which is
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
why we can't take tips made out in front
 
04:56:59.030 --> 04:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
and give them to hourly employees in the
 
04:57:00.650 --> 04:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
back of the house that would be a labor
 
04:57:00.660 --> 04:57:01.610 align:start position:0%
back of the house that would be a labor
violation

04:57:01.610 --> 04:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
violation
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
correct so how would you if you have a
 
04:57:06.170 --> 04:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
hourly employees out front hourly
 
04:57:07.850 --> 04:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
employees out back there'd be no
 
04:57:09.770 --> 04:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
mechanism for tipping
 
04:57:13.128 --> 04:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
because they're all hourly employees now
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
so there'd still be a mechanism for
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
tipping in this in the case of if you're
 
04:57:19.850 --> 04:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
had them providing a service and
 
04:57:21.470 --> 04:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
customers were leaving tips for them
 
04:57:24.050 --> 04:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
they'd still be in receipt of those tips
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
if you're saying this is eliminating the
 
04:57:30.530 --> 04:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
employer's right to pay not 725 but pay
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
327 this is absolutely doing that this
 
04:57:35.690 --> 04:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
is making that the employer is obligated
 
04:57:38.510 --> 04:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
to pay the full minimum wage instead of
 
04:57:40.448 --> 04:57:40.458 align:start position:0%
paying the 327
 
04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is changing that so if you're
 
04:57:44.930 --> 04:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
talking about the loss of that
 
04:57:46.910 --> 04:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely the employer is losing the
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
right to pay less than minimum wage and
 
04:57:51.590 --> 04:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
be credited we don't necessarily call it
 
04:57:53.410 --> 04:57:53.420 align:start position:0%
this way the feds call it a tip credit
 
04:57:56.090 --> 04:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh the state doesn't refer to it as a
 
04:57:57.650 --> 04:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
tip credit but yes this would be
 
04:58:00.288 --> 04:58:00.298 align:start position:0%
eliminating for State purposes your
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
ability to uh as an employer to pay less
 
04:58:05.930 --> 04:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
than minimum wage and be credited for
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
paying uh full minimum wage
 
04:58:09.120 --> 04:58:13.010 align:start position:0%
paying uh full minimum wage
Republic

04:58:13.010 --> 04:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
so the IRS tells us that we have to
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
maintain a minimum
 
04:58:18.240 --> 04:58:19.970 align:start position:0%
maintain a minimum
withholding

04:58:19.970 --> 04:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
withholding
 
04:58:22.610 --> 04:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
because we're paying sub minimum wages I
 
04:58:23.570 --> 04:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
don't like the word seven minimum wages
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
but this is what the law is
 
04:58:28.610 --> 04:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
the mechanism for hourly employees that
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
make above minimum wage say they make 15
 
04:58:31.730 --> 04:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
04:58:34.490 --> 04:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
there is no mechanism for us to withhold
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
tips or to maintain a collection of
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
chips or anything like that to claim for
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
them because they're an hourly employee
 
04:58:43.850 --> 04:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
they're no longer under that tipped wage
 
04:58:46.250 --> 04:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
done and I'll reference it to
 
04:58:48.650 --> 04:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
um you go into your doctor's office
 
04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're allow the employees do you tip
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
that secretary if that secretary is
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
tipped how do we claim those wages how
 
04:58:55.970 --> 04:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
does that employer claim those wages to
 
04:58:55.980 --> 04:58:57.590 align:start position:0%
does that employer claim those wages to
be

04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:58:57.600 --> 04:58:59.030 align:start position:0%
be
tips

04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
tips
 
04:59:02.330 --> 04:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
or any other hourly employer
 
04:59:04.910 --> 04:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
how do you do it now
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
we maintain
 
04:59:07.200 --> 04:59:09.530 align:start position:0%
we maintain
a

04:59:09.530 --> 04:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:59:12.170 --> 04:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
the IRS tells us we have to at least
 
04:59:15.170 --> 04:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
claim wages which would be their tips up
 
04:59:17.330 --> 04:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
to the minimum wage technically we're
 
04:59:19.610 --> 04:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
supposed to do it to upwards of our what
 
04:59:21.650 --> 04:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're actually claiming so they're
 
04:59:22.970 --> 04:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
supposed to be reporting what they're
 
04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
actually receiving in tips correct yeah
 
04:59:26.330 --> 04:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that would be the way
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
it would remain today if you're saying
 
04:59:30.410 --> 04:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
to me that a lot of people don't report
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
their tips but we're at least saying
 
04:59:34.128 --> 04:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
well you should be or they we are
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
reporting up to minimum wage I
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying that you
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
no longer would be able to just say well
 
04:59:43.970 --> 04:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna say that it was 7.25 per hour
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
but in terms of how it should be done
 
04:59:47.930 --> 04:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
they it should be reported what they
 
04:59:51.170 --> 04:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.810 --> 04:59:53.820 align:start position:0%
gonna further bloody the water on that
 
04:59:55.490 --> 04:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
so would that be considered unearned
 
04:59:56.930 --> 04:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
income or earned income because it's
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
above and beyond their hourly wage if
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're receiving a tip it would be
 
05:00:02.090 --> 05:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
earned income
 
05:00:04.970 --> 05:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
even though they're
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
even though they're an hourly employee
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
again I believe that they presently are
 
05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
an hourly employee whether this law
 
05:00:16.368 --> 05:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
passes or not if someone is being
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
working at a restaurant or working in
 
05:00:20.330 --> 05:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
any Endeavor in which they're a tipped
 
05:00:21.650 --> 05:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
employee but they're being paid an
 
05:00:23.930 --> 05:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
hourly wage they are both an hourly
 
05:00:26.330 --> 05:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
employee and a tipped employee I would
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
also say that we presently do have
 
05:00:30.650 --> 05:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
employees who are tipped employees who
 
05:00:33.170 --> 05:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
are paid in excess of the minimum wage
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
of of the sub minimum rate particularly
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
with the workforce shortages that have
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
been experienced around the state there
 
05:00:41.330 --> 05:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
have been many restaurants or other
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
environments in which tips are prevalent
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
where employers have elected to not
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
utilize the sub minimum rate because
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
they can't retain people in those
 
05:00:52.190 --> 05:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
instances which are presently happening
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether this law passes or not my
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is what they're doing is
 
05:00:57.948 --> 05:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
they're saying claim what you earned in
 
05:01:00.890 --> 05:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
tips and they are the employer again I
 
05:01:01.970 --> 05:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
don't know to your point I understand
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that if right now
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
you're saying well I don't know what
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
they made but I'm going to at least put
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
it as 7.25 I guess you would have to
 
05:01:11.270 --> 05:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
make some type of again estimate of what
 
05:01:12.770 --> 05:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
of what they would at least be bringing
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
apologies I understand I'm not
 
05:01:22.128 --> 05:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
addressing the I I I I I know you can't
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
because it's not part of their typical
 
05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
course of work
 
05:01:30.410 --> 05:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative uh I have uh I have a few
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions I guess and the first thing
 
05:01:33.170 --> 05:01:33.180 align:start position:0%
just a point
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
a point of order I guess is that
 
05:01:35.878 --> 05:01:36.708 align:start position:0%
a point of order I guess is that
um

05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:39.410 --> 05:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
is that everybody is required no matter
 
05:01:41.690 --> 05:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
who you are in the country 725 you're
 
05:01:43.610 --> 05:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
required to pay that
 
05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
it's the it is the uh industry the
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry that has a different
 
05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
arrangement in terms of how they satisfy
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
that 7.25 an hour
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
if an employee drops below
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
um if they don't collect enough in tips
 
05:02:02.208 --> 05:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
the employee has to make that up so that
 
05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
brings the employee to 725 an hour
 
05:02:08.208 --> 05:02:08.218 align:start position:0%
correct correct follow-up
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a starting point when you look
 
05:02:13.250 --> 05:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
at the way that the restaurant industry
 
05:02:15.770 --> 05:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
works is a restaurant industry has
 
05:02:17.708 --> 05:02:17.718 align:start position:0%
allowed uh
 
05:02:20.990 --> 05:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
to take a credit based on the amount of
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
tips that are received they take that
 
05:02:23.520 --> 05:02:24.530 align:start position:0%
tips that are received they take that
credit

05:02:24.530 --> 05:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:02:27.410 --> 05:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
and they use them the tip money against
 
05:02:29.690 --> 05:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
their responsibility for the minimum
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
wage correct to satisfy that 7.25 an
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
hour yeah at the federal level they
 
05:02:36.288 --> 05:02:36.298 align:start position:0%
refer to it as a tip credit and in our
 
05:02:38.208 --> 05:02:38.218 align:start position:0%
level at the state level we talk about
 
05:02:42.530 --> 05:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you and I I've had trouble
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
getting an answer to this question I've
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
asked a number of different people
 
05:02:50.690 --> 05:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
does the employer pay
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
on that credit pay wages either FICA or
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
food of taxes on that four dollars an
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
hour whatever case may be to satisfy
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
their responsibility under the federal
 
05:03:05.330 --> 05:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
do they pay taxes on that money
 
05:03:07.730 --> 05:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
or is that is that kind of out there and
 
05:03:09.890 --> 05:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
nobody pays any taxes on that credit I
 
05:03:11.150 --> 05:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe they're paying on what's
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
reported so it's similar in line with
 
05:03:15.650 --> 05:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative avalani was speaking to
 
05:03:18.410 --> 05:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
at some level they are ultimately they
 
05:03:21.770 --> 05:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
are reporting a payroll that is apparent
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
or supposedly inclusive of tips when I
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
say supposedly I'm not trying to be cute
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I do think in this industry there
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
are instances in which tips are
 
05:03:28.378 --> 05:03:29.690 align:start position:0%
are instances in which tips are
underreported

05:03:29.690 --> 05:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
underreported
 
05:03:31.930 --> 05:03:31.940 align:start position:0%
I believe that's something that happens
 
05:03:35.448 --> 05:03:35.458 align:start position:0%
so to be clear I believe though what the
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
employer is doing is they're saying okay
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is what we believe is the you know
 
05:03:42.830 --> 05:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
full uh fully reflective of remuneration
 
05:03:45.288 --> 05:03:45.298 align:start position:0%
to those employees and they are paying
 
05:03:48.288 --> 05:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
their withholdings or FICA whatever you
 
05:03:50.090 --> 05:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
want to refer to it as they are paying
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
it on that number now if someone is
 
05:03:54.770 --> 05:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
Under reporting if tips are being
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
underreported and I've got a hundred
 
05:03:59.510 --> 05:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in tips but I'm saying no I got
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
50 or some estimate was put in and it's
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
less than what I actually got is FICA
 
05:04:07.128 --> 05:04:07.138 align:start position:0%
being paid on the underreported portion
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
certainly not but on what's being
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
reported my understanding is the
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
employers are paying Fike on that but I
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
want to be clear in their perhaps others
 
05:04:17.208 --> 05:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
in the room who are experts I'm not a
 
05:04:19.368 --> 05:04:19.378 align:start position:0%
tax expert but that's my understanding
 
05:04:21.770 --> 05:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
from having spoken with employers
 
05:04:21.780 --> 05:04:22.430 align:start position:0%
from having spoken with employers
um

05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
I I need to close narrow this down I am
 
05:04:28.510 --> 05:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
doing it out okay I'm not I'm not
 
05:04:28.520 --> 05:04:30.190 align:start position:0%
doing it out okay I'm not I'm not
criticizing

05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
criticizing
 
05:04:33.708 --> 05:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
future questions going forward here we
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
have uh the assistant commissioner here
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
to talk about this amendment
 
05:04:39.050 --> 05:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
again what it does so
 
05:04:44.330 --> 05:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:46.250 --> 05:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll try to narrow it down as best I can
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
but I have the opportunity here and I
 
05:04:49.628 --> 05:04:49.638 align:start position:0%
want to ask this question
 
05:04:52.430 --> 05:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
in uh in the scheme of things if we
 
05:04:54.890 --> 05:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
looked at tipped employees uh under the
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
under the legislations before us the
 
05:04:59.810 --> 05:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
tipped employee would get credit
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
for the under the unemployment system
 
05:05:05.330 --> 05:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
for that full 7.25 an hour and they
 
05:05:07.788 --> 05:05:07.798 align:start position:0%
would get they would get uh
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
that when they looked at uh workers
 
05:05:12.770 --> 05:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
compensation they would get credit for
 
05:05:16.610 --> 05:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
that 720 25 an hour correct
 
05:05:18.350 --> 05:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
I can speak yeah I can speak more
 
05:05:20.448 --> 05:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
specifically to uh workers comp they
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
would get whatever we would say what was
 
05:05:23.930 --> 05:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
your average weekly wage over the
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
preceding period they would report that
 
05:05:28.010 --> 05:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
to us and they would get that so they
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
would get at least the the 727 but again
 
05:05:33.650 --> 05:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
when we get wage reporting or average
 
05:05:36.170 --> 05:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
weekly wage earning reports on tipped
 
05:05:38.570 --> 05:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
employees it is often an excess of
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
minimal you know they should be putting
 
05:05:41.930 --> 05:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
tips in there as well
 
05:05:43.550 --> 05:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if that doesn't answer the
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
question but it doesn't answer the
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
question but
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
they would get at least 725 yes
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
so okay so
 
05:05:54.650 --> 05:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to get 7.25 an hour
 
05:05:56.750 --> 05:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's a that's a base for the
 
05:05:58.610 --> 05:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
workers compensation law correct so that
 
05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
pain food taxes and FICA taxes and 7.25
 
05:06:04.190 --> 05:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
an hour is that the understanding of the
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
industry I just want to make because
 
05:06:12.650 --> 05:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.770 --> 05:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.780 --> 05:06:21.708 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage if they have to if the
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
employer has to make it up to a minimum
 
05:06:29.208 --> 05:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
so if you worked at a restaurant for an
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
05:06:33.288 --> 05:06:33.298 align:start position:0%
and you never made a tip
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
that you would make 7.25
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
employee would have to pay based on that
 
05:06:39.770 --> 05:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
the workers competence based based on
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
that if that was the most you made okay
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
and unemployment and workers comp
 
05:06:44.878 --> 05:06:46.910 align:start position:0%
and unemployment and workers comp
because

05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:06:48.948 --> 05:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
so any other questions regarding this
 
05:06:48.958 --> 05:06:51.190 align:start position:0%
so any other questions regarding this
amendment

05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:06:53.448 --> 05:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this amendment to
 
05:06:56.350 --> 05:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:59.690 --> 05:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
avaloni no I'm kidding I'm teasing go
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
ahead go ahead I was going to go into
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
work no no we we got to stick we gotta
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
stick to this
 
05:07:06.240 --> 05:07:08.690 align:start position:0%
stick to this
okay

05:07:08.690 --> 05:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:07:11.628 --> 05:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
any other questions about this amendment
 
05:07:14.810 --> 05:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you now
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion about the
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
amendment the with this amendment is on
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
the table
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
has been moved second discussion
 
05:07:29.090 --> 05:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
a representative Schultz
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair you could do this but since
 
05:07:34.070 --> 05:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the author of the amendment I just
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
want to be clear again
 
05:07:38.510 --> 05:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
both the bill and the amendment do not
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
change the minimum wage
 
05:07:43.490 --> 05:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
um the amendment itself
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
leaves in those exceptions
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
the carve-outs it only changes the sub
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and eliminates that
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
category in general it does not address
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
tipping it does neither does the bill
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
that would be on top similar to a Dunkin
 
05:08:05.810 --> 05:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
Donuts worker who has an hourly rate
 
05:08:08.810 --> 05:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
they make tips on top
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
um depending on your Dunkin Donuts if
 
05:08:12.050 --> 05:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
they have one of those little collection
 
05:08:12.060 --> 05:08:13.610 align:start position:0%
they have one of those little collection
cups

05:08:13.610 --> 05:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
cups
 
05:08:16.190 --> 05:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to reiterate that
 
05:08:18.170 --> 05:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
because I feel like we've got our
 
05:08:20.208 --> 05:08:20.218 align:start position:0%
questions answered but we've also gone
 
05:08:22.970 --> 05:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
into depth about what are more related
 
05:08:26.330 --> 05:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
to the bill and not the amendment itself
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say my bottom line
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I started with this is if you want
 
05:08:34.250 --> 05:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
to make the bill better and simplify it
 
05:08:36.830 --> 05:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of your view and vote on the
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill overall
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
I would suggest voting for the amendment
 
05:08:45.890 --> 05:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative kale thank you Mr chair
 
05:08:47.570 --> 05:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting for the amendment
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
although I'm not quite sure whether spun
 
05:09:00.830 --> 05:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
all right I will be supporting the
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
amendment not the final bill because
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we contain we
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
continue to have these carve outs they
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
were there for a reason they've been
 
05:09:10.610 --> 05:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
there for a while
 
05:09:13.730 --> 05:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
and I think it was an honest error on
 
05:09:15.530 --> 05:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
not keeping them there and I think
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's very important regardless of
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
where the bill goes
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:22.680 --> 05:09:23.590 align:start position:0%

no we'll start again you do have to you
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move ought to pass
 
05:10:59.150 --> 05:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
with amendments
 
05:11:00.770 --> 05:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
that seconded
 
05:11:05.810 --> 05:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're um recognized to speak your
 
05:11:10.490 --> 05:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
emotions I'm going to keep it brief
 
05:11:14.570 --> 05:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
since it's um been discussed
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
but the content of the policy is this
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the sub minimum wage is a Vestige of
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
a situation that is irrelevant today
 
05:11:28.690 --> 05:11:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
moving to get rid of the sub-minimum
 
05:11:35.208 --> 05:11:35.218 align:start position:0%
wage for tip workers in fact will help
 
05:11:38.208 --> 05:11:38.218 align:start position:0%
um employers and employees both
 
05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
I love math
 
05:11:42.230 --> 05:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of us love math or we
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a legislator in this
 
05:11:46.610 --> 05:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
committee but not everybody's great at
 
05:11:49.730 --> 05:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
it nor do they have an accountant Etc
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
so it's also a matter of simplicity if
 
05:11:55.128 --> 05:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
folks are supposed to be making the
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
regular minimum wage anyway
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
then this make sure we do it above board
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
across across the way
 
05:12:07.550 --> 05:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
11 states have already done this
 
05:12:07.560 --> 05:12:08.208 align:start position:0%
11 states have already done this
um

05:12:08.208 --> 05:12:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
this is a Vestige of Jim Crow laws and
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
it's beyond out of date the people who
 
05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
have tipped wage jobs are overwhelmingly
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
women typically with children in the
 
05:12:18.840 --> 05:12:20.390 align:start position:0%
women typically with children in the
home

05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
and more importantly we've had our
 
05:12:26.090 --> 05:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
incidents investigated by the U.S
 
05:12:28.690 --> 05:12:28.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor at some restaurants
 
05:12:31.190 --> 05:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
luckily not a majority
 
05:12:33.650 --> 05:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
because of the confusion I wouldn't
 
05:12:35.930 --> 05:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
ascribe any malice per se I think it
 
05:12:37.368 --> 05:12:37.378 align:start position:0%
really is confusion
 
05:12:41.628 --> 05:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
but a significant number of fines have
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
been paid in New Hampshire because of
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
this confusion I believe a fellow rep
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
has the exact number I could be wrong on
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
that but
 
05:12:51.530 --> 05:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
um that's really what this the intent of
 
05:12:54.410 --> 05:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
the bill is not to the other Bill dealt
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
with the minimum wage this is simply to
 
05:12:59.090 --> 05:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
get rid of the sub minimum wage
 
05:13:02.448 --> 05:13:02.458 align:start position:0%
for tipped wage workers
 
05:13:04.550 --> 05:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
um which really improves the whole
 
05:13:07.850 --> 05:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
system really so regular minimum wage
 
05:13:10.310 --> 05:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
or higher If an employer chooses to pay
 
05:13:12.770 --> 05:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
an hour hourly rate higher than that and
 
05:13:15.850 --> 05:13:15.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.740 --> 05:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would oppose the
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
otpa on this uh because this legislation
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
would really hurt tipped employees I
 
05:13:33.530 --> 05:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
took the chance to speak to many tipped
 
05:13:35.330 --> 05:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
employees I know a lot of tipped
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
employees I used to work in the industry
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
myself and uh they all universally
 
05:13:42.890 --> 05:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
dislike the legislation and uh it's
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
obvious why if you actually think think
 
05:13:47.090 --> 05:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
through the actual map of the scenario I
 
05:13:49.330 --> 05:13:49.340 align:start position:0%
mean you can say that it isn't a tip ban
 
05:13:51.890 --> 05:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
and no it doesn't explicitly ban tips
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
but the incentives are there and they'll
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
line up in a sense
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
that would uh it would make it so as an
 
05:13:59.330 --> 05:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
employer it would make more sense just
 
05:14:00.650 --> 05:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
to have them as a regular hourly
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
employee because otherwise you're losing
 
05:14:04.970 --> 05:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
money right if you have an hourly
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
employee and they're costing you so much
 
05:14:08.570 --> 05:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
then it's gonna you know you can keep
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
them there with and then you know just
 
05:14:11.690 --> 05:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
not accept tips and then you can keep
 
05:14:14.448 --> 05:14:14.458 align:start position:0%
your price down right because uh when
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're expecting a tipped employee to
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
earn their income and up to the minimum
 
05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
wage through tips then that means that
 
05:14:23.208 --> 05:14:23.218 align:start position:0%
they just they can keep their prices low
 
05:14:24.830 --> 05:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
and then they can just keep the price on
 
05:14:27.288 --> 05:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
the menu lower and the customers who
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
actually come to the business would be
 
05:14:31.490 --> 05:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
better off but uh this is even though it
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't explicitly say this and even
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
though you know you can say oh you know
 
05:14:37.128 --> 05:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
that it isn't a ban on tipping it's a de
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
facto tip ban it would result in lower
 
05:14:43.070 --> 05:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
hiring rates of servers and uh even
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
though uh they mean well they want to
 
05:14:46.730 --> 05:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
improve the amount of money that servers
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
are taking home uh every server I've
 
05:14:50.570 --> 05:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
spoken to and every server I've ever
 
05:14:52.250 --> 05:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
talked to about this sort of legislation
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
which is a lie universally disapprove
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
this the tip is
 
05:15:00.410 --> 05:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
very large part of their of their
 
05:15:03.470 --> 05:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
industry many people work in Food
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
Service specific specifically because of
 
05:15:07.610 --> 05:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
the way the Tipping works and it isn't
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
for example Clerk thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:14.400 --> 05:15:15.050 align:start position:0%
for example Clerk thank you Mr chair
um

05:15:15.050 --> 05:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:16.250 --> 05:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
although it has been a couple years
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
since I worked in the industry
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
um I don't think personally anyway I'm
 
05:15:25.250 --> 05:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to tip someone based on their pay
 
05:15:27.050 --> 05:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tip someone based on their
 
05:15:28.970 --> 05:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
service which again this is a service
 
05:15:28.980 --> 05:15:30.708 align:start position:0%
service which again this is a service
industry

05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:15:33.050 --> 05:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and I kind of think for the
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
restaurants part
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
that having that Gap not having to deal
 
05:15:38.090 --> 05:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
with it anymore
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
makes a little bit easier
 
05:15:40.798 --> 05:15:42.770 align:start position:0%
makes a little bit easier
um

05:15:42.770 --> 05:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah again I I worked above minimum
 
05:15:48.770 --> 05:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
wage in restaurants and
 
05:15:48.780 --> 05:15:49.490 align:start position:0%
wage in restaurants and
um

05:15:49.490 --> 05:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
the restaurant always told me kind of
 
05:15:53.090 --> 05:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
what I had to tip
 
05:15:55.250 --> 05:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
if I had a thousand dollars of sales
 
05:15:57.288 --> 05:15:57.298 align:start position:0%
they figure I'm going to make at least
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
15 tips I gotta claim half of that so
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
boom eight percent
 
05:16:04.430 --> 05:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
now maybe I've made more and most of the
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
times I did but if that's all the
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant wanted to report then that's
 
05:16:11.390 --> 05:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
all I reported and so the restaurant is
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
reporting it in into
 
05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Adkins
 
05:16:17.208 --> 05:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
you know he was talking about I think we
 
05:16:19.128 --> 05:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
were talking about unemployment stuff
 
05:16:20.810 --> 05:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
that wage is included in your
 
05:16:23.628 --> 05:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
unemployment in what you made so
 
05:16:25.250 --> 05:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know as long as that's being claimed
 
05:16:27.410 --> 05:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
you're not just making
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment wages according to the 725
 
05:16:32.090 --> 05:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
an hour or the minimum wage you're
 
05:16:34.490 --> 05:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
making it according to your tips as well
 
05:16:36.890 --> 05:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
because it's all like you said it's all
 
05:16:40.730 --> 05:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh recordable income so thank you thank

05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
um I just want to remind my fellow
 
05:17:10.610 --> 05:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
Representatives that we heard in public
 
05:17:13.010 --> 05:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
testimony about the impact on the
 
05:17:16.250 --> 05:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
employer there's a line in their balance
 
05:17:18.890 --> 05:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
sheet that is the checks that they have
 
05:17:20.890 --> 05:17:20.900 align:start position:0%
to write each week
 
05:17:23.930 --> 05:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
and this law would more than double that
 
05:17:23.940 --> 05:17:24.708 align:start position:0%
and this law would more than double that
line

05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:17:28.730 --> 05:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
if in addition to that uh the bill that
 
05:17:30.590 --> 05:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
we discussed earlier
 
05:17:33.310 --> 05:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
were passed or a federal minimum wage
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
was raised that would more than double
 
05:17:38.930 --> 05:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
that line and that's a substantial
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
number that's a substantial disruption
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
to an industry that is very important to
 
05:17:46.610 --> 05:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
the state and
 
05:17:51.770 --> 05:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative Prout
 
05:17:57.410 --> 05:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
I believe I remember correctly that we
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
heard during public testimony and I'm
 
05:18:02.090 --> 05:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
sure someone will correct me if I'm
 
05:18:05.570 --> 05:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
misremembering that Maine did this
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
and then very quickly had a march on
 
05:18:11.570 --> 05:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
these state house and with a effort to
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
repeal which they then did repeal it
 
05:18:17.090 --> 05:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
um that's a very local example that hits
 
05:18:19.310 --> 05:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
home for me of
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not good for the next date over
 
05:18:22.970 --> 05:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
to the point where they had to repeal it
 
05:18:26.030 --> 05:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
very quickly after passing it we should
 
05:18:28.250 --> 05:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
tread very lightly before we considered
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
following in that
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:36.650 --> 05:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
before I let people speak twice or
 
05:18:40.010 --> 05:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to speak the first time
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz
 
05:18:44.690 --> 05:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
I think it's great to talk about Maine
 
05:18:47.930 --> 05:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
the voters of Maine eliminated the sub
 
05:18:50.690 --> 05:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
minimum wage through a referendum the
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
legislature with heavy pressure from
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um lobbyists
 
05:18:56.160 --> 05:18:56.930 align:start position:0%
um lobbyists
um

05:18:56.930 --> 05:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:01.550 --> 05:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:03.310 --> 05:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
05:19:07.970 --> 05:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I thank you
 
05:19:11.150 --> 05:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
so the the concept of sub minimum wage
 
05:19:12.770 --> 05:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
we've heard where it where it came from
 
05:19:12.780 --> 05:19:13.670 align:start position:0%
we've heard where it where it came from
but

05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of every other employer in the
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
05:19:19.010 --> 05:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
every other employer who opens their
 
05:19:21.770 --> 05:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
doors to work is each and every day
 
05:19:25.128 --> 05:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
for the most part pay 7.25 an hour
 
05:19:27.170 --> 05:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
and somehow we've created this
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
environment where it's acceptable for
 
05:19:31.550 --> 05:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
one part of the industry
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
to pay sub minimum wages not only that
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
but to meet their obligation by taking
 
05:19:41.570 --> 05:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
the the comp like taking a credit for
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
the tips that the employee makes
 
05:19:46.610 --> 05:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
there is no other business in the state
 
05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who does that
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
not only that but the industry also has
 
05:19:54.530 --> 05:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
made other uh other Deals they they have
 
05:19:56.330 --> 05:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
a reduced FICA tax
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
so we have a reduced minimum wage we
 
05:20:00.530 --> 05:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
have a reduced FICA tax we have a
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
reduced food attacks and I don't know
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
why every other employer in the state of
 
05:20:05.690 --> 05:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire isn't in this room saying
 
05:20:07.250 --> 05:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
why not me
 
05:20:09.530 --> 05:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
why are we why is this industry the only
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
one that's doing that and let me just
 
05:20:13.490 --> 05:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
say this also I I did some research
 
05:20:15.170 --> 05:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
around employees
 
05:20:18.410 --> 05:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
you know they think that that it we
 
05:20:19.970 --> 05:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
haven't that that they're doing they
 
05:20:21.650 --> 05:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
have a a great deal
 
05:20:23.650 --> 05:20:23.660 align:start position:0%
because they can work in restaurants
 
05:20:26.510 --> 05:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
that are profitable restaurants but I
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's a 325 and not 327 an
 
05:20:32.448 --> 05:20:32.458 align:start position:0%
hour uh what it is is it's a profitable
 
05:20:33.770 --> 05:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
restaurant they want to be there and
 
05:20:35.150 --> 05:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
they want to work there and you ask
 
05:20:37.970 --> 05:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
those employees do you want to make 7.25
 
05:20:39.170 --> 05:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
05:20:41.690 --> 05:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
they would say yes but if you have to if
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
you frame it in a way that you want to
 
05:20:45.530 --> 05:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
make 7.25 an hour and somehow you're
 
05:20:47.150 --> 05:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
going to lose your tips
 
05:20:48.830 --> 05:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
then they're going to say something very
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
different so Mr chairman this is this is
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
time has come to eliminate this practice
 
05:20:58.128 --> 05:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
for for a segment of our economy to
 
05:20:59.810 --> 05:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
bring him in line with everybody else in
 
05:21:01.850 --> 05:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and and do
 
05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
away with the sub minimum wage in the
 
05:21:05.810 --> 05:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire thank you Mr
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
followed by representative thank you Mr
 
05:21:12.530 --> 05:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to know what FICA tax
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.570 --> 05:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
if you look okay you know if you
 
05:21:20.580 --> 05:21:21.650 align:start position:0%
if you look okay you know if you
disagree

05:21:21.650 --> 05:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
I can show you the reference of a FICA
 
05:21:27.650 --> 05:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
if you disagree you just you'll
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
I've never seen them okay I don't know
 
05:21:36.230 --> 05:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
where they are so maybe I need a new
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
account no
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
 
05:21:42.650 --> 05:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
I also disagree with the credit on the
 
05:21:44.270 --> 05:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
FICA tax because my understanding after
 
05:21:46.010 --> 05:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
listening to the commissioner was that
 
05:21:49.368 --> 05:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
the employers are paying a minimum FICA
 
05:21:53.868 --> 05:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
tax on 725 an hour 727 an hour and they
 
05:21:56.208 --> 05:21:56.218 align:start position:0%
um are paying everything else above that
 
05:21:58.850 --> 05:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
that the tipped employee is earning so
 
05:22:01.550 --> 05:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
then there is no credit or deduction in
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
FICA tax when their minimum
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility is minimum wage is seven
 
05:22:09.170 --> 05:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
twenty five seven twenty seven per hour
 
05:22:12.350 --> 05:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:14.090 --> 05:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Clark
 
05:22:15.650 --> 05:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
um again being in the industry and
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
making whatever we made an hour
 
05:22:22.368 --> 05:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
I've gotten checks even after working 30
 
05:22:24.430 --> 05:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
hours a week for
 
05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
3.75 because all my tips are included
 
05:22:28.560 --> 05:22:30.288 align:start position:0%
3.75 because all my tips are included
and

05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:22:32.570 --> 05:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
um with the deductions after including
 
05:22:34.430 --> 05:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
the tip income
 
05:22:36.288 --> 05:22:36.298 align:start position:0%
there was nothing left in the check so
 
05:22:37.788 --> 05:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
obviously I didn't work for the check I
 
05:22:39.948 --> 05:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
work for the tips
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:43.550 --> 05:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and then I'm
 
05:22:43.560 --> 05:22:44.930 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan and then I'm
gonna

05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
05:22:46.250 --> 05:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
pull it up
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
this is not an elimination of tips
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is elimination of the sub minimum
 
05:22:53.040 --> 05:22:54.650 align:start position:0%
this is elimination of the sub minimum
wage

05:22:54.650 --> 05:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
wage
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
um and frankly I consider myself a
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
pretty good Tipper I um I used to work
 
05:23:00.890 --> 05:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
for tips Once Upon a Time too and I
 
05:23:03.490 --> 05:23:03.500 align:start position:0%
think most people who ever did that
 
05:23:06.288 --> 05:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
make a point of
 
05:23:11.810 --> 05:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
make a point of leaving good tips
 
05:23:13.970 --> 05:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
um but I never ask the server are you
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
making sub minimum wage are you making
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
minimum wage are you making more than
 
05:23:22.610 --> 05:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
minimum wage as you regular hourly rate
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
I simply give them a good 20 tip
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
um so this is not an elimination of tips
 
05:23:31.970 --> 05:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't think anybody who goes into a
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant is going to think those folks
 
05:23:36.650 --> 05:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
are making so much money at minimum wage
 
05:23:38.930 --> 05:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
that they don't deserve a tip
 
05:23:44.410 --> 05:23:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:46.550 --> 05:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative love
 
05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh it seems like the
 
05:23:51.170 --> 05:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
the one group of people that are being
 
05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
left out of this is the consumer you
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
know the there's many families that that
 
05:23:57.288 --> 05:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
have budgeted the their uh you know
 
05:23:59.930 --> 05:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
their weekly uh uh going out to eat and
 
05:23:59.940 --> 05:24:00.890 align:start position:0%
their weekly uh uh going out to eat and
uh

05:24:00.890 --> 05:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:24:03.170 --> 05:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
you know if uh if the prices rise in the
 
05:24:03.180 --> 05:24:04.430 align:start position:0%
you know if uh if the prices rise in the
restaurant

05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
05:24:06.410 --> 05:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh because of this we've heard how
 
05:24:09.288 --> 05:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
they're uh their the paychecks would
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
would uh the the the
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners um
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh payroll will double
 
05:24:16.920 --> 05:24:17.570 align:start position:0%
uh payroll will double
um

05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:20.090 --> 05:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
you you can't help but know that you
 
05:24:22.128 --> 05:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
know the tips are going to come down uh
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know the payroll doubles the prices
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the meal goes up uh the tips come
 
05:24:29.330 --> 05:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
down most most servers I know uh dread
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
this uh I I know plenty that they're
 
05:24:35.150 --> 05:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
making two 250 you know a night for six
 
05:24:38.150 --> 05:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
hours you know not a bad wage
 
05:24:41.150 --> 05:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the you know they want it
 
05:24:43.730 --> 05:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
left alone and uh I'll be voting right
 
05:24:47.628 --> 05:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:47.638 --> 05:24:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
states have already done this with no
 
05:24:56.930 --> 05:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
detriment to the restaurant industry and
 
05:24:59.448 --> 05:24:59.458 align:start position:0%
leaders in the restaurant industry like
 
05:25:02.090 --> 05:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
The Darden companies said in an investor
 
05:25:05.090 --> 05:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
call this that in the states where the
 
05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
sub-minimum wage was eliminated they're
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
actually doing pretty well so we can
 
05:25:14.448 --> 05:25:14.458 align:start position:0%
look to those States as an example and
 
05:25:14.458 --> 05:25:15.410 align:start position:0%
look to those States as an example and
um

05:25:15.410 --> 05:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
from where those states have continued
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
to have it it has continued to be a good
 
05:25:23.330 --> 05:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
thing and um
 
05:25:25.490 --> 05:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that I know
 
05:25:28.850 --> 05:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.730 --> 05:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
you keep referencing the 11 states and I
 
05:25:34.368 --> 05:25:34.378 align:start position:0%
guess my curiosity is when we go out to
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
eat in New Hampshire standard tippings
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
20 uh if you have good service you
 
05:25:40.490 --> 05:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
probably give a little more than that
 
05:25:42.410 --> 05:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
but even on the automated tipping thing
 
05:25:44.810 --> 05:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
it automatically pops up at 20 now in
 
05:25:47.330 --> 05:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
these 11 states that have a higher
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
minimum wage
 
05:25:51.770 --> 05:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
is are they still receiving a 20 tip or
 
05:25:54.170 --> 05:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
is it a 10 tip because
 
05:25:56.270 --> 05:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
other people have mentioned that this is
 
05:25:57.350 --> 05:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to bring down the amount of
 
05:25:58.970 --> 05:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
tipping and I think that might actually
 
05:26:02.270 --> 05:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
happen if you compare wages of New
 
05:26:02.280 --> 05:26:03.230 align:start position:0%
happen if you compare wages of New
Hampshire

05:26:03.230 --> 05:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
servers compared to one of these other
 
05:26:07.250 --> 05:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
11 states I'd be willing to best
 
05:26:08.510 --> 05:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
probably the same we're just trying to
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
do it in a different way
 
05:26:13.128 --> 05:26:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative Granger
 
05:26:14.810 --> 05:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair another thing to
 
05:26:16.730 --> 05:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
consider whenever it comes to increasing
 
05:26:19.490 --> 05:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that come out of the
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
employer's pockets is that this has a
 
05:26:25.850 --> 05:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
tendency to allow corporate chains to
 
05:26:27.708 --> 05:26:27.718 align:start position:0%
out-compete their smaller competitors
 
05:26:29.868 --> 05:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
all right I like the small I like
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
tandy's all right I like margaritas too
 
05:26:35.208 --> 05:26:35.218 align:start position:0%
but I like tandy's because it's not a
 
05:26:37.910 --> 05:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
chain right we got so many nice tiny
 
05:26:39.890 --> 05:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
restaurants in New Hampshire that will
 
05:26:41.810 --> 05:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
just get eaten alive by the Applebee's
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I gotta say I don't want every
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
restaurant to be Applebees and TGI
 
05:26:47.810 --> 05:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
Fridays I want them to be the
 
05:26:49.610 --> 05:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
interesting niche
 
05:26:52.010 --> 05:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
creative places that we have in New
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not just the chains
 
05:26:56.990 --> 05:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
because the reason that Walmart and
 
05:26:59.330 --> 05:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
Target like minimum wage increases which
 
05:27:00.650 --> 05:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
this is is a minimum wage increase
 
05:27:03.410 --> 05:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
basically is because they can afford it
 
05:27:05.570 --> 05:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
they can take the hit they have like 40
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
Restaurants or 40 stores or a million
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they have they can they can
 
05:27:11.690 --> 05:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
afford it because they know that they're
 
05:27:12.770 --> 05:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
going to win out at the end of the day
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
when all the other stores close down
 
05:27:16.850 --> 05:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to be out of business all
 
05:27:18.110 --> 05:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
the other little restaurants they're
 
05:27:19.850 --> 05:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
going to be under you know the mom and
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
pop places the little diners The Wooden
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
Spoon and Somersworth gone all right
 
05:27:26.510 --> 05:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to be replaced by TGI
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
Fridays and that's what you're gonna be
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
stuck with
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:33.410 --> 05:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make the final comment then
 
05:27:34.970 --> 05:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
we'll have a vote
 
05:27:36.770 --> 05:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately I can't support the
 
05:27:36.780 --> 05:27:37.970 align:start position:0%
um I unfortunately I can't support the
bill

05:27:37.970 --> 05:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:27:39.890 --> 05:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
um I like the New Hampshire way
 
05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
I like that an employer wants to give
 
05:27:46.550 --> 05:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
7.25 to the tipped employees they can
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
they can give anything higher than the
 
05:27:50.650 --> 05:27:50.660 align:start position:0%
the what we have now with
 
05:27:54.350 --> 05:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
327 thank you four five six seven
 
05:27:55.910 --> 05:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour
 
05:27:59.150 --> 05:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
I like it that I can go to a place and I
 
05:28:02.090 --> 05:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
can round up my bill to give to Veterans
 
05:28:04.670 --> 05:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
I like it that if I choose to when they
 
05:28:07.250 --> 05:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
have a line there that says uh if you
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
add one more dollar to your your bill
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
then that will help pay for the health
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
insurance of the employees I like those
 
05:28:13.798 --> 05:28:15.350 align:start position:0%
insurance of the employees I like those
options

05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
options
 
05:28:17.448 --> 05:28:17.458 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
05:28:20.030 --> 05:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
employers have that option to do that
 
05:28:21.770 --> 05:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
and more
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
probably will to keep the
 
05:28:28.128 --> 05:28:28.138 align:start position:0%
to keep their employees one of the
 
05:28:31.850 --> 05:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
things that a business owner wants is to
 
05:28:33.530 --> 05:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
have happy employees
 
05:28:38.090 --> 05:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that they will make those
 
05:28:43.368 --> 05:28:43.378 align:start position:0%
decisions for their businesses and for
 
05:28:45.470 --> 05:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
their employees and we don't necessarily
 
05:28:48.110 --> 05:28:48.120 align:start position:0%

reports these are all without
 
05:36:09.770 --> 05:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
recommendations to these are just
 
05:37:15.410 --> 05:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:17.690 --> 05:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to start with our
 
05:37:23.208 --> 05:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
last bill of today House Bill 118 FN and
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
I call on representative Granger for a
 
05:37:27.120 --> 05:37:27.948 align:start position:0%
I call on representative Granger for a
motion

05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:37:30.410 --> 05:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh I would move
 
05:37:34.550 --> 05:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we go itl on HB 118. is there a
 
05:37:34.560 --> 05:37:39.890 align:start position:0%
that we go itl on HB 118. is there a
second

05:37:39.890 --> 05:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:43.250 --> 05:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:45.890 --> 05:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the reason I support
 
05:37:47.448 --> 05:37:47.458 align:start position:0%
itl on this bill is I believe the
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
premise of the bill is flawed it is a
 
05:37:51.050 --> 05:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
good idea for employers to provide basic
 
05:37:52.610 --> 05:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
Union training to employees considering
 
05:37:54.530 --> 05:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
the dangers inherent immune Union
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
unionization especially in a state that
 
05:38:01.970 --> 05:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:03.948 --> 05:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much it's open
 
05:38:05.930 --> 05:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
for uh discussion representative
 
05:38:05.940 --> 05:38:08.690 align:start position:0%
for uh discussion representative
Sullivan

05:38:08.690 --> 05:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chair
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
I support the uh concept of this bill
 
05:38:18.610 --> 05:38:18.620 align:start position:0%
um I think captive uh
 
05:38:21.410 --> 05:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
meetings of employees
 
05:38:21.420 --> 05:38:22.208 align:start position:0%
meetings of employees
um

05:38:22.208 --> 05:38:22.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:25.910 --> 05:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
horse-feeding anti-union sentiments to
 
05:38:29.448 --> 05:38:29.458 align:start position:0%
them on the job without the option of
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
them walking away
 
05:38:33.730 --> 05:38:33.740 align:start position:0%
is simply wrong
 
05:38:37.368 --> 05:38:37.378 align:start position:0%
however I am going to support the itl
 
05:38:40.430 --> 05:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
because of some structural problems that
 
05:38:42.830 --> 05:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
were brought to our attention with with
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
the way the bill has been put together
 
05:38:44.280 --> 05:38:45.890 align:start position:0%
the way the bill has been put together
and

05:38:45.890 --> 05:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:47.930 --> 05:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
um therefore we'll um
 
05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
we'll pack our tent and come back
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.690 --> 05:38:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative attitude
 
05:39:02.570 --> 05:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I look forward to
 
05:39:04.368 --> 05:39:04.378 align:start position:0%
the second half of this year where we
 
05:39:06.350 --> 05:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
can finally level the playing field
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
between employers and employees
 
05:39:08.040 --> 05:39:09.650 align:start position:0%
between employers and employees
regarding

05:39:09.650 --> 05:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:39:12.050 --> 05:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the rights to organize and labor
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%

September that will address these
 
05:39:20.810 --> 05:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
structural issues like representative
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
Sullivan mentioned uh but we are not
 
05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:27.240 align:start position:0%

subcommittees would stay behind so we
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%

there's two subcommittees and then we
 
05:41:33.410 --> 05:41:33.420 align:start position:0%

05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
um we have uh call it eight bills left
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%

not going to get any executive session
 
05:41:45.530 --> 05:41:45.540 align:start position:0%

05:42:02.990 --> 05:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
