00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
specified that the commission would
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
contain three house members at least one
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
from this committee and at least one
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
from Ways and Means along with one
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
Senator and six members from outside the
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
legislature the commission met for the
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
first time in July of 22 and quickly
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
determined that it would have its hands
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
full focusing on just assessing power
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
generation so it put off assessing how
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
to assess
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
transmission HB 410 specified that the
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
commission would disband on November 1st
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
of 2022 the commission had not quite
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
finished its work by then it's final
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
report filed on October
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
2722 recommended that a bill be filed to
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
continue the commission that bill was SB
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
225 from earlier this year it
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
reconstituted the commission with an end
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
date of November 1st of this year and it
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
also made changes to the membership one
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
member of the public was added to be
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor making seven
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
non-legislative members that public
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
member was intended to be the honorable
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
patab bramy who had been chair of the
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
Commission in 22
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
per RSA
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
1449 the majority of the commission must
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
comprise legislators and so
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
sb225 specified six house members at
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
least one from this committee at least
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
one from Ways and Means and two senators
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
the house members appointed were two
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
from Ways and Means David rochfort and
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
Richard Ames and four from this
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee Tom PL Chris muns James
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
Summers and myself the reconstituted
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
commission met for the first time on
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
September 25th of this year giving it
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
just a little more than one month to
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
conclude its business and that was just
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
not enough time and moreover there was a
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
mixup occurring with uh patab bramy
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
chairing the commission at its first two
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
meetings but it turned out that
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
apparently he was not the governor's
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
appoint e Lisa Shapiro was uh so Senator
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
Tim Lang ended up chairing the
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
commission this non- gerain amendment to
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
HB 458 continues the commission with two
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
sb225 First is that the end date becomes
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
November 1st of 20
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
24 and the second is that the six house
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
members would be two from this committee
 
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
two from Ways and Means and two from
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government we
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to reduce the number of St
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
members because this commission is not
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
about energy as much as it's about how
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
to assess taxes on power generators two
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
ways and means members make sense in
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
this context and also two municipal and
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
County government members make sense
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
because these facilities are paying
 
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.949 align:start position:0%
because these facilities are paying
Municipal

00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:00.190 align:start position:0%
Municipal
Taxes

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
Taxes
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman any
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Corman
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none thank you for that
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
I'll next call on representative Pat
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
abrami to make some very brief comments
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
about continuing this study
 
00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:23.079 align:start position:0%
commission welcome representative former
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
representam yes this this is this
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
commission has had quite a journey we
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
had very great success
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
several years ago with the uh taxing of
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal taxing of uh utility assets
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
and that that's in place now and we
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
solved the big problem a 40-year problem
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
with that then the the power generator
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
folks power generator folks approached
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
us there's 59 power generating
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state from the
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
smallest Dam to the to seber nuclear
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
power plant uh we formed a commission
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
last year as was said uh we we ran out
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
of time but we were making progress
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
everybody in that commission there's
 
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
three three other than legislators
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
there's three constituencies the the Min
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
palities are
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
represented the uh Power gener rator
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
people are gener are represented and the
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
assessing communities is represented and
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
the goal of this commission is very
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
specific we got to get all those three
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
groups to agree on a solution and that's
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
what we did with transmission we're
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do this again the bill that
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
came out this year to continue to
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
commission came out late and we were
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
only able to meet three times and not
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
enough time although all all those cons
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
constituencies felt that we're making
 
00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
progress again and that we wanted to
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
find a way to Fast Track getting because
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
the error we made last time was we we
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
put the end date is November 1st of
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
23 so what this what this amendment does
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
is it does two basic things it extends
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
the date now to uh November 1st of 24
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
and it changes the as was mentioned it
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
changes the mix because some of the
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech folks said you know we
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
really don't know this assessing stuff
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
uh what I did in the inter room that
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't said was I met with I chatted
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
with uh representive tort uh the uh
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
chair of of Municipal I said can you
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
find me two two people who understand
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
something about Municipal taxing and he
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
got back to me after his flight to
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
Europe and he he's a pilot he came back
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
the next week to me and said yes I found
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
two good people that we will assign to
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
this commission so that's what I wanted
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
to add to what was said and uh I hope
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
you do uh pass this amendment so we can
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
proceed uh where where we left off the
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
goal is to with with you doing it this
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
way is that we this this will be voted
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
on in first week of January Senator Lang
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
said he will help us fast track it
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
through the Senate so that we can get
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
working as soon as we can thank
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you honorable Pat abami any
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr abrami representative
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um and
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
you may not have the answer to this
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm not quite sure how you were
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
involved how much you were involved with
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment however on line 19 it
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
talks about confidential data
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
reporting can you explain what that
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
is well that's that's one of the issues
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
addressing right
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
now um the assessing data that the
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities say they need to properly
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
assess these is not available to them
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and that's one of the
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
issues that uh we we've been discussing
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
and we need to continue to discuss other
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
states do allow uh not just for
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
utilities but for any any other
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
properties and that's the stumbling
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
block we have how can we do it just for
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
utility uh for uh power generators to
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
open the allow them to share the
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
information now when they go to court
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
which a lot of these do wind up in court
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
guess what it's open you know all the
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
data is shared but again this is one of
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%

right people in the room to have this
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
conversation and we want to continue to
 
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360 align:start position:0%

thank you chair and thank you Mr Bari um
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
just a a housekeeping that the RSA and
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
in this amendment on line 25 it's the
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
speaker that will appoint the two and
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
just so we don't have another mixup as
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
you witness yourself uh if the speaker
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
the speaker will be appointing uh
 
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.470 align:start position:0%
the speaker will be appointing uh
represent

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
tur uh
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah was your last sentence representing
 
00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.389 align:start position:0%
yeah was your last sentence representing
appointing

00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
appointing
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
who or uh Ways and Means will suggest to
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the speaker will appoint them we
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
need the speaker to appoint him and make
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
offal want to make sure that the the the
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
speaker does a point and his uh Deputy
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
is the one that that actually does the
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
appointing um and we will we will give
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
him a heads up as to our hope is that
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
all the all the people who are on the
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
commission now will be reappointed the
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
only uh the ways it means people I think
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
we have two that we will we will they
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
they are looking for names believe me
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
they they they they go to chairs and say
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
who do you have so we'll get the two
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
municipal ones that we that uh
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative turkot talked about uh
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means is fine with what they
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
have and then I think among the four
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
here uh I know several of you said you
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
you felt uncomfortable so U hopefully
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
you'll let you'll let um the chair know
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
if you're still interested on in being
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
on this Commission because they do reach
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
out to the chairs looking for for member
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
cities commissions okay thank
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
you any additional questions
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
more of a clarification on the question
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
you your question on confidentiality a
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the since we have a competitive
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
power Market in New England the uh
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
generators don't publish how much they
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
generate and when so because this has to
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
do with what they bid in in the day
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
ahead in real-time markets as well as
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
the capacity markets of course for the
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
biggest one CBR uh all you have to do is
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
go to the NRC daily report and they'll
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly what they're putting
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
out every day but they still consider
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
the information confidential that's what
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
they're referring to and it turns out C
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
Brook has negotiated anyway at the end
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
negotiated thing so representative Wendy
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
Thomas um this is in response to that
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
that comment do you want me to wait
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
until we execute or anything I just um
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm a little hung up on this
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
conv if you have a question go ahead and
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
ask I don't have a question if it's just
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
a comment let's hold
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
it well it's a comment wrapped up in a
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
question I still don't understand the
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I mean if if and this is
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
addressed to representative Harrington
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
because of what you just just said um so
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
they're withholding that information
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
because they want a better price is that
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
the reason well it's it's considered
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
confidential because they're in a
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
competitive market and every day the
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
price I mean as we sit here right now
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's a day ahead price that was set
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
yesterday and there's a real-time price
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's set in real time those vary based
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
on how many people bid in at what price
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
so if someone for example is has a
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance outage and they're going to
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
reduce their power by 20% that will
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
change what they bid in and that may
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
push the price of the of the real-time
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
market up or down so those are facts
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
they don't want the public to know in
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
advance basically competitors it's not
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
so much they don't want you to know they
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't want the other generators to know
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much thank
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair all right there's one last
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
person who would like to speak to us
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
about this uh non- gerine Amendment
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's James Mahan here to representing
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
the New England power gener generators
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
Association Mr Mahan
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as you said I'm
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
Jim Maham with the DuPont group I'm here
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the New England power
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
generators Association uh we've kind of
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
been the moving party on this for the
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
last couple years to try to get um um uh
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
support to address an ongoing problem um
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a post um devestator
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
restructuring issue um the uh new the
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
the power Jers in Hampshire as this
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee is well aware are not
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
regulated entities they operate just
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
like any other manufacturer uh the the
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
problem is that they're taxed twice
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
unlike every other manufacturer in the
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
State uh they pay a state utility
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
property tax and they also pay a local
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
um uh uh property tax uh what we're
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is um uh coordinate
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
and centralize that activity so first of
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
all there's not two valuations and
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's become a pretty conspicuous
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
problem where uh the valuation from the
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
state uh for an individual plant uh uh
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
might be half of or sometimes even more
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
dramatic than how the local entity uh
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
values it um so the first task at hand
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh is to address this Central issue of
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
unregulated um uh manufacturers who are
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
not utilities should pay the utility
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
property tax the other issue is when it
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
comes to the local valuation what type
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
of agreed upon formula should be put
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
together so there's some consistency
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
Community to community with how the
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
power plants are
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
taxed which seems simple enough but when
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
you start unwinding things here for
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
example the because the utilities
 
00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
because the um uh power plants pay the
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
utility property tax they don't pay the
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax and this
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
essential question well maybe it would
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
be more efficient to uh move education
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
dollars from the um uh power plants
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
through the Statewide property tax as
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to making a um utility property
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
tax which goes goes into the um
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so I think that's
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
why uh this matter is the those
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
complications suggests that it may be uh
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
prudent to use the commission to sort
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
through some of these issues so that
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
when legislation is Advanced on these
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
two topics um there's kind of been that
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
deep work that's underway I should say
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
the other important party to this that
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative abrami didn't mention is
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
they are very involved in this uh
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
they've been a great resource um they
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
can produce more spreadsheets than you
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
can believe um but um they're part of
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
the team as well so but I'm happy to

bill uh was was the right action and we
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
also had discussed that ideally we would
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
substitute a LSR which I had have in the
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%

uh but at at uh broader or uh intervals
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%

expect I may tweak it yet one more time
 
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
before it's finally signed off all that
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%

representative Harington just one Qui
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
quick thing we shouldn't forget on this
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
bill is that an issue was raised that it
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional which I agree it is
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
so we should always keep that in
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded that we itl
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%

any discussion of that
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
motion uh just that this has been done
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
many times and it just doesn't uh it's
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
not just not ready something that we
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a a good idea at this
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
time any further discussion on the of
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
itl for HB 166 representative Harrington
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not going to give a long drawn
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
out speech here because I know this is
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
going to be passed as itl but people
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
should just remember useful thermal
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
energy has absolutely nothing to do with
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
the reducing the uh amount of
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
electricity that's used why electric
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
rate payers of spa of having to pay
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
higher electric bills so that some
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
entity can burn wood in their furnace is
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
beyond me it's just a total disconnect
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
we you know what's going to be next
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to put a rate payers and say
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
well you know I think this is a good
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
idea maybe we should have uh free milk
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
for everybody it's under four years old
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
so we're going to give them all free
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
milk and the rate payers will pay for it
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with electricity
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's just subsidizing people and
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
basically the reason it passes because
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
the people who sells wood chips have a
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
real good lobbyist so I think this is uh
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
and now of course we've got uh
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
government entities counties that have
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
gone out and taken advantage of this so
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's a program that once you start it
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
once you create the Beast it keeps
 
00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
eating and it just keeps getting bigger
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
and bigger and regretfully that's what's
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen with this
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar so this will be on

the regular
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%

00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
exec session and open the next exec
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
session which is HB
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
175 relative to the state's energy
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
consumption reduction goal
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
and on this bill I recognize
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%

00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move itl I repres
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
CL I'll second that moved and seconded
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
that we itl HB 175 representative PL did
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
you have anything to say about this uh
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh this um legis this
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
came up twice before it's been voted itl
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe the online polling were all
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
against it maybe 40 to zero so I
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
recommend we continue um not continue
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
this any further thank you
 
00:42:14.319 --> 00:42:15.750 align:start position:0%
this any further thank you
representative

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah this was done at the
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
request of the Department of energy
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
asked me to put this bill in and I still
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense because if the uh
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
goal here is to reduce greenhouse gas
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
emissions that's more incomp thing than
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
saying fossil fuel consumption so you
 
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
could reduce fossil fuel consumption uh
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily uh there's other
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
things that you can do to reduce
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions that don't
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
involve fossil fuel so I think it's a
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea but I'm not going to
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
bother fighting it if no one else wants
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
it I guess I think the department of
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
energy seems to have lost their
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for it so I'll be voting
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I ask a clerk to
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
call all the role on the question of itl
 
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
175 Doug
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas yes Janine ner yes Michael
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
Harrington yes Steven Kennedy yes John
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
20 so by a vote of 20 to nothing
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
HB 175 is judged to be worthy of itl
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put this on the
 
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:04.710 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll put this on the
consent

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
calendar hearing no objections it will
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
go on the consent calendar and
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative n will write the
 
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.270 align:start position:0%
representative n will write the
committee

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
Report with that we'll close the
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
175 and open an executive session on
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 176 relative to rules of the
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and before I
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion on this bill I want
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
to relay a conversation I had with the
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
house clerk about the proper way to
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
motion a
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill that you plan to
 
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
amend the clerk tells me that the proper
 
00:44:47.319 --> 00:44:48.829 align:start position:0%
amend the clerk tells me that the proper
motion

00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
is I move to I move ought to pass as
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then the same person offers an
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment so the motion would
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
be Mr chairman I move ought to pass as
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
and offer amendment number and then the
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
amendment number so that's the proper
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
way to do this and with that I recognize
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for a motion
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
motion that we uh approve uh HB 176 as
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%

223-229
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
option I recognize representative lii I
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
second it's been moved and seconded that
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
we judge House Bill 176 to be ought to
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
pass as amended with Amendment 2023
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
pass as amended with Amendment 2023
2299

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
2299
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
H I recognize representative Harrington
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
to dis to discuss thanks this amendment
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
and tell us how it is different from the
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
original bill yeah this this kind of
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
goes back a long time there was a bill
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
pass dealing with the site evaluation
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee specifically having to do with
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
new requirements for win projects it put
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
in things like emergency plans and other
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
things that were is subscripted in law
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
and told the uh site evaluation
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee to rewrite the rules to
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
accommodate the new Bill well they did
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
that but they kept going and they
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
applied the sections that only apply to
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
win projects to all energy projects
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
transmission projects new types of
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
generation whatever it was they applied
 
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:39.559 align:start position:0%
it to it and that was a beyond what the
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
law authorized them to do so the
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
original bill that came out basically
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
said uh here's the here's the areas
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
where you overstepped your Authority
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
specifically but you also ought to check
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
all the rest of you rules to make sure
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
they comply with the law it was
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
discussed and thought that was too broad
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
so what the amendment does is it just
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
narrows it down to the specific sections
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
where the law was not uh followed and it
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
says fix your rules to match the law and
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
only in these sections that are listed
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the new Amendment and not a general
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
rules okay uh representative McGee so I
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
have a question representative
 
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
Harrington um can you can you um since
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
we're just you know we just received the
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
amendment recently we've looked at it
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
we've looked uh online at the statute
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
but can you just explain for us here
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
what changes will result from these not
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
not in a general way that they'll be
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
able to make their own rules but what
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
does this order them to do in terms of
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
changing the statute as far as that goes
 
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
there is no change what it does is it
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
limits them to specifically what was
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
listed in the original bill but it takes
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
out the look at all you rules as well so
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
specifically it talks about
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
um uh it it's the site rule which exes
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
the authority of the committee by
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
requiring the committee to conduct it ad
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
judic of hearing prior to exempting an
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
applicant from approval and certificate
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
provisions of 162 H and then there's
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
another rule that says requires the
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
proposed energy facility to include a
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
visual impact such impact is required
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
for wind energy systems only under RSA
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah there is no such
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
requirement RSA
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
16287 which applies to all energy
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
facilities and then the last one goes on
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
that's then two more goes on to say that
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
require all energy facilities to have a
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
sound assessment and fire protection
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
plan which required only for and wind
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
energy facilities under the law and High
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
Press gas pipelines under another
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
section of the law and finally it
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
requires all energy facilities to have
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
an emergency response plan there is no
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
such requirement in 1628 so basically
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
what it does is it tells the site
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee that well we really
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
don't are ruling on whether these ideas
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
are good or bad or should be in place or
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in place the fact is the
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
law doesn't authorize you to do it so it
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
says follow the law as simple as
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
that you have a follow-up representative
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
McGee yes I I think you know this is
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
kind of illustrative of what the issue
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
is with having a late breaking Amendment
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
on a bill that has been batted around on
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
both sides of the house and uh on in
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
with multiple Vehicles right this was a
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill that was identified as it l or
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
interim study early on and we hadn't
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
really paid much attention to and now uh
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
the the way I look at it um we're saying
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
that that the site evaluation committee
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
is not able to undertake any um any
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
inputs in their adjudicative proceedings
 
00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:49.799 align:start position:0%
that are not spelled out in the law um
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
but I don't see how this improves what
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
we have done and I think it needs more
 
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
gestation Within this committee so that
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
we have an understanding of what we're
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
asking them to do rather than again
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
having this come at this late time so
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not in favor of passing this because
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
there was ample time to present such
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
amendments during the SEC hearings that
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
we had on other with other vehicles this
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
year representative Arrington yeah just
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
again so we're clear this is the only
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
thing that was changed in the bill from
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
as introduced the as introduced bill in
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 said in order to amend the
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
rules pursuant to section one of this
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
act the committee shall include but not
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
be limited to the following that but not
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
be limited to has been removed so
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing news coming in here this
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same as it was when it
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
was introduced whenever it was last year
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
um the only thing we did was We Shrunk
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
down the scope of the bill to
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
specifically talk about the things where
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
they the site evaluation committee
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
exceeded their Authority and they simply
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't create law they Implement law and
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
if there's a requirement that says wi
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
facilities must have an emergency
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
response plan but there's no requirement
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
for any other type of facility to have
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
it the site evaluation committee
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be imposing that because they
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea if they think
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea they can come back to
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
this committee and propose legislation
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
and we can put that in but they don't
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
have the authority to to to in install
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
these things on their own and in fact if
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
it went to the site evaluation committee
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
and they required them to do that I'm
 
00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
sure some developer would take them to
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
court and win because is saying you're
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
acting outside of your Authority there's
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
no law that gives you the authority to
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
require this and all this does is say
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
make the rules comply with the law
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
period and that's nothing's changed
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
since it was originally introduced all
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's done is limit the scope down to
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
saying we got rid of uh include but not
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
it so Jael car probably should have
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
picked this up when they originally
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed the site evaluation committee
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
rules but somehow they they missed it
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that go ahead rep I I
 
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
talked to a senator who's actually no
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
longer a senator at the time who was on
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
Jael car I was not on this committee nor
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
was I on the site evaluation committee
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
at the time and I brought this to his
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
attention he basically said we've been
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
screwing around with those rules for so
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
long no one understands them anyways
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass them as is just to
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
get them off of our desk and that's what
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
happened so they blew it and they didn't
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
want to address the
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
issue represent pres ative
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chairman I do
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
recall when we had our public hearing on
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
this bill we uh we specifically
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
identified or these four items were
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
specifically identified as problems and
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
hence I I think this amendment is is in
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
order it it doesn't make sense for us to
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
kick this can down the road any further
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
let's just fix
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
this further discussion representative
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
um looking looking at this amendment and
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
when I compared it to the original bill
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
I I see the same reference to uh
 
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
rules um but I think there may be a
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
drafting era um if you look at line 18
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it references um uh regulation site
 
00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.789 align:start position:0%
and it references um uh regulation site
301.8c

00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
301.8c
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
1 and three it the way it's worded it it
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
suggests that those that that rule that
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
those rules require all energy
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
facilities but if you actually read the
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
the rule it specifically says that those
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
rules relate only to high pressure gas
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
pipelines so um you know that being the
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
case I mean I think this is the way it's
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
worded is is an error
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
um so that that is a um I I I think
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's just a drafting error um and on a
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
more substantive note um if you look at
 
00:54:09.309 --> 00:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
uh line 16 it says there is no
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
requirement in
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
RSA 162
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
H7 to permit visual impact assessments
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
well there is no some there is nothing
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
that specifically says that they can do
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
visual impact assessment but RSA 162 287
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
provides broad Authority for the site uh
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee to regulate quote
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
any aspect of the construction or
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
operation of a facility and the impact
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
on the environment so that to me would
 
00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
give them the authority if they felt the
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
need to look at a visual impact
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
assessment so um I don't think that I
 
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't think you know paragraph B is
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
necessary because of what I just said
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
and as I said paragraph C I think think
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
is just out andout incorrect in terms of
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
regulation any further discussion
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee and just kind of
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
put a pin on that note uh that
 
00:55:14.589 --> 00:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
representative muns just made what this
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
brings to mind is the fact that we're
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the SEC should not have any
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
Authority beyond what we have spelled
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
out uh in the
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
statute how ever they are the body that
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
we've assigned to do site
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation um and so uh the general
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
Authority that's being pulled back I
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
think it needs more work more discussion
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
and not to be something that we are um
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
pushing through at the last minute
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
assuming that it's going to fix problems
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
with the SEC I think we have to have
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
more fullsome discussions around what
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
those problems are that we're trying to
 
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
solve rather than just shoving some
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
language in at the last moment that
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
again we have questions about and we
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
this was not a vehicle that we were um
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we were working on uh throughout
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
this period in terms of a retained Bill
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
status so um I really don't see any
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
reason to change the status that we had
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
um for this
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
bill so representative McGee you keep
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
talking about last minute
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
language uh thrown our way this bill was
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
produced last February so this language
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
has been around since then with the
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
exception of the three or four words
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
that this amendment removes from the
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
original statute so is that's a
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization to say that this Mr
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
chairman but in all of our meetings this
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
bill was itl Andor interim study so
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
there was no consideration of this bill
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
moving forward until this
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
week further discussion representative
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah just speaking to this
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and I I appreciate uh
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's desire to
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
you know set things in order in terms of
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
the rules governing the the site
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but you know given
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
what he just said about the way they
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
operate um I I am concerned that this
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
would have unintended consequences for
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
instance just an just the requirement of
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
having an emergency response plan okay
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
maybe that only by law uh is required of
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
certain facilities but and to my mind it
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
seems like a good idea for all
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
facilities to have an emergency response
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
plan as it would for any organization so
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
are we then saying that it's not
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to have an emergency response
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
plan if we say you know if we if we pass
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment so uh that's just one
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
confusion I think needs to be straighten
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
out so I agree with representative McGee
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
we need more time to think about and
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
hear maybe hear from other experts who
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
would be able to Enlighten us about
 
00:57:49.319 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
would be able to Enlighten us about
about

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
that further discussion representative
 
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.630 align:start position:0%
that further discussion representative
Bernard

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
Bernard
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
already Yes uh this conversation I guess
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh ticks one one of the fundamental
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
premises of of how government is
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to operate uh New Hampshire
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides that the state
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
legislature make laws we set the
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
policies by making those laws we do not
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
give administrative agencies the
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
authority to make law make decisions
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
that are contrary or above and beyond
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
the policy prerogatives that we give
 
00:58:31.839 --> 00:58:33.390 align:start position:0%
the policy prerogatives that we give
them

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you know I I find the
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
comments of Representative muns and
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
Kaplan not in order this bill basically
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
says this legislature is defining where
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
the agency is to act and how they're to
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
act and they need to implement that
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.789 align:start position:0%
act and they need to implement that
policy

00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:58:55.799 --> 00:58:57.670 align:start position:0%
policy
additional

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative Ms thank you Mr
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to uh thank
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
representative Camp Kaplan for
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
highlighting um the um the language in
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
lines 21 and 22 because again that's a
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
drafting error if you read
 
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.710 align:start position:0%
drafting error if you read
3018

00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
3018
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
C4 it says and I'm quoting an
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
explanation of why the setbacks
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
described by the applicant in response
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
to three above are adequate to protect
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
the public from risks associated with
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
the operation of high-pressure gas
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
pipelines has nothing to do with
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
emergency response
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
plans um Mr chairman if I may please
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh the you
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
correct there's a mistake in the
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
drafting so I suggest we just uh itl
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
this and I'll get those fixed and bring
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
them back next year I don't see there
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to be any crisis if we don't but
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
there's there's mistakes here must have
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
been transposing it from the last bill
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
bill or something on this because this
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill has come up before and so but it's
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
as written it's it has mistakes so no
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay so fast uh late breaking what do
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
they call it on on TV breaking
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
news it appears that uh that we now want
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
to back away from this uh Amendment and
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
this otpa motion so um that drafting
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
errors or other errors that have been
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
recognized can be addressed
 
01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:29.430 align:start position:0%
recognized can be addressed
further

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
discussion well because we have a motion
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
on the floor we have to vote on it even
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
though we probably want to back away
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
from it at this point so I'll ask the
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.470 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
of

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
otpa with Amendment 2299 h a question Mr
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%

Harington could I simply withdraw the
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is that possible that we have
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
yes you could withdraw the amendment
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%

generation and those of you who are who
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
were at the public hearing earlier this
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
morning fully understand the reason for
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
adopting this bill to extend the life of
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
this commission through November 1st of
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
2024 is any further discussion needed
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I I support um adoption of this bill
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I would um add or or
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
encourage is that um if we adopt this
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill and it gets adopted by the house
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
that every effort is made to expedite um
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
review and approval of the bill by the
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
Senate so that the commission can begin
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
meeting as expeditiously as possible um
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
what the reason we we actually need this
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
bill is that the prior Bill wasn't
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
handled as quickly as possible and so
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
the commission didn't meet until
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
September and um the commission really
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
wants to get on with its business and
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
and and meet as early as possible in the
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
year so anything we can do to expedite
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
that would be much
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
appreciated so noted representative
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas and how would one go about
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
Expediting that
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
as chair of this committee I would
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
consult with representative of Senator
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
ten Tim Lang who was chair of way and
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
means in the Senate okay and let him
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
know that when the bill gets to the
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
Senate he needs
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
to move it through as quickly as
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
possible he was the chair of this
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
commission last year so he he's well
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
aware of the issues okay thank you any
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
needed seeing none I would ask the clerk
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the question of
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%

as amend
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
458 if we put this on the consent
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
calendar it will get through the house
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
more quickly therefore it can get to the
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
Senate more quickly so I recommend that
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
we without objection we put this on the
 
01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
we without objection we put this on the
consent

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
calendar agreed seeing no
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
objections so
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
moved and representative plog will write
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%

interim study is there any uh discussion
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
motion representative Corman thank you
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman as I am a new member of the
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
House I'd like to know what the
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
implications of moving a built to
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
committee in the second year of the
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
house for a bill that the committee
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
judges to be Unworthy of Passage at the
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
moment but that could be potentially
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
recommended for passage in the future so
 
01:13:49.149 --> 01:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
once a bill goes into the status of
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
recommended for interim study the
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee can then decide whether it
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
wants to actually study it further and
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
recommend it for future
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended for
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
future legislation those are the two
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
motions that will the bill will be
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
required be subject to later in the
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
session or later in the year so
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
referring the bill for interim study is
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
just a way to allow it to
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
continue but prevents its passage in the
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
session thank
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%

you actually answered part of my
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
question um by um the the previous
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
answer is it uh done by a subcommittee
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
or is it done by the entire committee an
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
interim study the entire committee will
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
have to once the pill is is passed as
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
inter interim study we'll have to decide
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
we'll have to decide at a future date do
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
we want to study this bill or not and
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
that'll just be by a vote of the
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 509 I'm not sure if we
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
need a committee report for interim
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
study that's TBD if we do uh I will
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
write it myself how's that
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington sure I don't
 
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
think we do okay whatever
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
consent if it goes onto the calendar it
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
will go onto the calendar and cons on
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
consent but I'm not sure it goes onto
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
the calendar I think it may still just
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
reside with our committee but I'll have
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill 509 and now move
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%

321h to House Bill
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
558 representative
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair um I I I just have
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
a a couple questions um
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
relating to the language in lines 19 and
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
20 um and I'll just read it for the
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
record evaluation criteria and approval
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
process for utilities to propose a
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
limited number of microid grid pilot
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
projects to the Public Utilities
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
Commission annually so my questions are
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
there's two two questions really and
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody from the subcommittee
 
01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:17.669 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody from the subcommittee
can

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
answer um this language the way I read
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
it it it it kind of implies that um that
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
utilities are going to be the ones that
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be proposing microid grid
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
projects and my understanding was that
 
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
we were looking for private developers
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
to um developers or municipalities to um
 
01:19:45.950 --> 01:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh propose microgrid projects so my
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
question is is this going to is this
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
limiting the ability of non- utilities
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
to propose propos projects and then the
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
second question is it talks about um
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
proposing pilot projects
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
annually and um that just seems odd that
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
you would be proposing pilot projects
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
annually you do a pilot to kind of do a
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
proof of concept and then you move
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond a pilot to real project so I just
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
was kind of curious what the logic was
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
for including that l language that that
 
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.790 align:start position:0%
for including that l language that that
word

01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
annually well it was my impression that
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
this was in there as an option for the
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
study committee to
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
discuss uh those just one of the items
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that would be brought under
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't think there was any
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
intention to say that you would or or or
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
or that you wouldn't I would have to um
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
ask the other subcommittee members if
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
that was yourison as
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
well anybody else want to make a
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
well anybody else want to make a
comment

01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I just was looking back at
 
01:21:00.430 --> 01:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
my notes from the hearing uh where we
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
discuss some changes that representative
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
Ammon might consider in the amendment
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we have before us and um we had
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
discussed um instructions to the doe
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
regarding um reporting on federal monies
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
and um discussing the value of microG
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
grids so basically basically uh giving
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
us information about what they're
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
finding from their
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
review um and uh let's
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
see we also discussed including the US
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
doe definition of a micro grid because
 
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't have that information in
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
statute and there was a question what is
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
a micro Grid in that hearing so I'm just
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
wondering whether any of those notes
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
that came from the hearing got
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
incorporated or uh were discussed but
 
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
then uh decided not to be included in
 
01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:02.270 align:start position:0%
then uh decided not to be included in
the

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah I it's um we
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
did talk about some of those ideas and
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
at the time we we felt with um we wanted
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
to get this study going and uh time
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
being what it was we felt that the that
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was presented to us
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
although not perfect was good enough to
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
to go through and I think we had some uh
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
discussion with the doe involving the
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
pilot programs and there ideas were that
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
they they really wanted to work out the
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
Technologies before they entered into
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
into any pilot program at at the time so
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
this is why some of that is still in
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
there is as being discussed um and
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's why we felt that in the in the
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
interest of this important project to
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
get going the amendment as presented was
 
01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:55.719 align:start position:0%
was enough to get us through and
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
anything that has to be tweaked
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
obviously could be done at a later date
 
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
but um but yes those ideas were talked
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
about uh there there were many of them
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
but that's what the study committee is
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
for is to discuss these things thank you
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's fair and line 16 representative
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
McGee of the amendment says that
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
definitions and Technical requirements
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
to qualify as a microgrid is part of the
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
Department's investigative
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.430 align:start position:0%
Department's investigative
proceeding

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
proceeding
in

01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
general a bill that requires the doe to
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
open an investigative
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding can provide guidance but it's
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
to touch on every single thing that an
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
investigative proceeding might
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
reveal so I think that um nitpicking the
 
01:23:49.709 --> 01:23:49.719 align:start position:0%
language on line 16
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
through 20 through 30 would probably not
 
01:23:57.390 --> 01:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
serve us well representative
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
bney thank you Mr chairman I'll just
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
point out the last one says any other
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
relevant issue raised in the
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
Department's investigation proceeding so
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
it basically covers
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
anything that is
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass as amended excuse me
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
chair representative Noel uh thank you
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'm still wondering about
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative ms's first question about
 
01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.030 align:start position:0%
representative ms's first question about
the

01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
utilities uh be leading the
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
process uh again being deregulated and
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
not responsible for for for generating
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
power anymore uh I'm curious how the
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
utilities get to be the ones who who
 
01:24:47.679 --> 01:24:49.950 align:start position:0%
utilities get to be the ones who who
decide

01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
that well I think that's a a good
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
question and it's something that the
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
investigative proceeding will explore
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
about so we'll just have to see what the
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
investigating Pro in investigative
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
proceeding reveals about whether it
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
else representative PL uh thank you CH
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
not the belabor this any longer but um
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
the line 16 along with 19 if I remember
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
right when I
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
attended uh the subcommittee and these
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
micro grids are going to be
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
interconnected with the utilities the
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
utilities be working with the mun
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
municipals and
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
businesses they're from the way I read8
 
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.310 align:start position:0%
businesses they're from the way I read8
line

01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
18 you know once they get that if it's
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
can advance or not they will do that
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
reporting um and propose it I don't read
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
it myself s because of line 16 that
 
01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
they're just proposing their own they're
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
still working with the municipals um and
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
businesses since they're going to be
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
tied into the utilities grid also it's
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
standalone thank you representative
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um this
 
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
is just a general comment about the
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
format of this bill um on lines 22 24 26
 
01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.910 align:start position:0%
format of this bill um on lines 22 24 26
and

01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
28 um and Oxford Comm is used and um I
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
had a big discussion with the clerk
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
about Oxford commas and he said oh no
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
they're not used in New Hampshire um
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
which is why because I said the name of
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
our committee should be science comma
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
technology comma and energy anyway it's
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
a minor knit however I would like to
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
know if you are aware of a state of New
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere I've never seen one there must
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
be one in LS though I would guess I'll
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
check and I will get back to you or to
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
everybody any further
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm you know I I I heard a lot
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the discussion about you know uh the
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
way the language being drafted giving
 
01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:21.639 align:start position:0%
the department the flexibility to to
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
look into to various things and um I
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm willing to concede that um
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
but I also uh am reminded of uh a
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
comment that one member of our committee
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
made um and on the discussion about a
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
previous bill that you know the
 
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
legislature um kind of sets the policy
 
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.830 align:start position:0%
legislature um kind of sets the policy
and

01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
tells everyone what to do um so um you
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
know it language matters um and you know
 
01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
I just would have been more comfortable
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
if we' been a little bit more specific
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
with the direction that we're providing
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
to the um to the Department of energy
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
but um I trust that they will um you
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
know take as an expansive view of this
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
possible representative McGee I'll just
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
add by way of easing people's concerns
 
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
that I think in the first section um
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
starting on line 8 uh within 120 days of
 
01:28:28.109 --> 01:28:28.119 align:start position:0%
effective date the department shall
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
initiate a proceeding to investigate
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
potential benefits risks and key
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
considerations around developing a
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
framework for electricity grids in the
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
state in doing so the department shall
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
consult with electric distribution
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
utilities micro grid technology
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
companies distributed generation project
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
developers high density load businesses
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities one or more state
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
universities and other relevant entities
 
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that that precursor really
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
sets up the idea that it's going to be a
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder process that will get all
 
01:29:01.709 --> 01:29:01.719 align:start position:0%
the people in the room that need to be
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I'll ask the qu
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%

01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%

amendment our subcommittee met three
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
times to discuss the changes that are in
 
01:31:46.679 --> 01:31:47.510 align:start position:0%
times to discuss the changes that are in
the

01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that you are looking at right
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
68h it makes significant several
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
significant changes to the site
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee it reduces the
 
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
number of the members of the committee
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%

council
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
it sets a quorum for the meetings of the
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee at three
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
people unless those three people are the
 
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
public utilities Commissioners they
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
alone cannot constitute a quorum
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%

Department of Environmental Services
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
Andor the public me member would be
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
required to join two other people to
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
constitute a
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
quorum the committee also uh the
 
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:01.400 align:start position:0%

01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Public Utilities
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%

the duties of pres presiding officer on
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
a caseby Case
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
basis including the administrative
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
actions of the committee to that
 
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
actions of the committee to that
presiding

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
presiding
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
officer another big change that the
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
amendment makes is to change the
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
definition of the site evaluation
 
01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.950 align:start position:0%
definition of the site evaluation
committee

01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
administrator this amendment makes that
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
person a employee of the Public
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission who can float
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
between doing duties for the Public
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission or the site
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee with
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
a preference for site evaluation
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee duties or a priority for site
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
duties and whenever
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
the administrator performs duties for
 
01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
the administrator performs duties for
the

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
SEC they will be funded as set forth in
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
162 that basically follows the model
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the administrator is paid by today
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
this will relieve a lot of the funding
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
pressure that currently exists on the
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee they have a
 
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
full-time administrator but they don't
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
have a way to pay
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
him by being an admin an employee of the
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission that person
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
will get a regular paycheck and I'm sure
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
he will he or she will appreciate
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
that the other changes that the uh
 
01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
amendment makes are basically language
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
Chang es to add designated presiding
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
officer to existing language in the
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
statute and the statute also because it
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
repeals the need for
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees it makes some language
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
changes on page four lines 24
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
through uh 30 to remove the mention of a
 
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.270 align:start position:0%
through uh 30 to remove the mention of a
subcommittee

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
in on page
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
four starting at line 32 the funding
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
plan there was a reference on page five
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually line three to a section of the
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
law that no longer exists so that had to
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
be removed as well so those are the
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
changes that this amendment
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
makes After extensive discussion with
 
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.109 align:start position:0%
makes After extensive discussion with
the

01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we believe that these
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
changes will significantly
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
improve the
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
timeliness of the site evaluations
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee's deliberations and its
 
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.950 align:start position:0%
committee's deliberations and its
processing

01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
of the applications that are made for a
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
site certificate we also believe that it
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
will reduce the cost of those
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
applications by improving the
 
01:36:23.070 --> 01:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
timeline and getting those applications
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with more
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
promptly so we think this is a good
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment as written as you can see the
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is sponsored by all five
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
members of our subcommittee we recommend
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
its uh
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
adoption and I'd like to hear
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
your discussion of this amendment we'll
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
start with representative Wendy Thomas
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um 609 as we first
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
got it had a fiscal note and you just
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this amendment will
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
include the funding of a position so
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean the fiscal note will be
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
this if we adopt this uh Amendment and
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
the bill moves forward the fiscal note
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
will be revised yes and do you have an
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
idea of the cost I I mean I'm not the
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
the cost to fund that position do you
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
have an idea of how much that would that
 
01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.910 align:start position:0%
have an idea of how much that would that
would

01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
be I can't answer that no okay thank you
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah um but just I caution
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
people on this uh let's not uh give up
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
the good to find the perfect uh I think
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one that's actually served
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
on a site evaluation committee and I
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
served on seven or eight of them and
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
they're a mess they go on and on and on
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
hours of trying to schedule things get
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
people together they stretch out for
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
months upon months upon months and it
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
sends a message to people don't come to
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because it's too confusing
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
and too complicated to invest here so
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is a big step in the right
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
direction it may not be perfect we may
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
be back here or someone back here two or
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
three years from now saying well we've
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
been using this but we can make some
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
more tweaks to make it better that's
 
01:38:01.589 --> 01:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
probably going to happen but again let's
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
not hold off for perfect when we have
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
good and this is a good step in the
 
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.390 align:start position:0%
good and this is a good step in the
right

01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
direction thank you I think it's
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
important to point out that this
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to the site evaluation
 
01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.950 align:start position:0%
amendment to the site evaluation
committee

01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
process while it makes some changes the
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the existing process
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
continues to exist and will move forward
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
it will be the process by which site
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
certificates are evaluated by which the
 
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
public will participate in the sighting
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
process so it's important to keep that
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
in mind that while these in changes are
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
important the vast majority of RSA 162
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
remains in effect now we already
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
modified part of RSA 162 with hb281
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
back earlier this year and those
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
amendments are now part of existing
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
statute those were important amendments
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
because they clar clarified the role of
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
state agencies in this
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
process that has been done and this
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
amendment continues the process of
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
reforming the site evaluation Committee
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
in such a way as to make it more
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
effective representative Thomas has a
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chair uh actually
 
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
just like what you said I just wanted to
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
add that this is a prime example of a
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
bill that had an extremely Lively public
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
hearing when it was first uh brought up
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
and the work efforts on both sides of
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
the parties has resulted in significant
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
progress in small steps but significant
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
nonetheless and I think this is an
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
excellent example of how the hard work
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
that was done between both both sides in
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
getting something actually done that
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
will actually improve the process
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to repeat something
 
01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
I said in our subcommittee meeting which
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
is uh something that doesn't happen very
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
often I agree with the remarks from
 
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.030 align:start position:0%
often I agree with the remarks from
representative

01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
Harrington and the Patriots still lost
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
Ms representative Ms you're recognized
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair as I as a said
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago um word words do
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
matter and um I I think this is an
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
exceptionally well-written
 
01:40:33.589 --> 01:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment um so um no no no objections
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
there and I and I also believe that it
 
01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:37.430 align:start position:0%
there and I and I also believe that it
will

01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
um um help to expedite the review and
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
approval of um you know much needed uh
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
projects going forward so I U I commend
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
the uh study
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative Summers
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair U my only question is
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
narrowing down from nine down to five
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
and accept in the case of where there's
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
only one commissioner from the Pu
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
present to make Quorum was it the
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
intention to have a uh majority number
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
else not sure I understand the question
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
but so to verify if if there's four
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
members and you have two two PU and one
 
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
of each of the other the Pu outnumbers
 
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
them if there's three members and two of
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
them are pu so all all the cases except
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
for the case where there's only one pu
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
member the Pu would always outnumber the
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
other members in that quum of five if is
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was that the intention that's was
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
asking yeah I think the answer is yes
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative n thank you Mr
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I had a question for you when
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee Met uh were members of
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
the public present at the sub committee
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
that were here for the original Bill yes
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%

01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%

01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
public meetings held in this room in
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
fact followup followup uh there we in my
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
notes uh there was one woman who was
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
adamantly opposed to this bill because
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
she doesn't like wind um does this
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
amendment satisfy her name is Lisa Leno
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
h i I know you know her I'm not sure how
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
to say her name Leno Lisa Len did not
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
attend any of the subcommittee
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
meetings thank you representative Wendy
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um just
 
01:42:29.159 --> 01:42:30.870 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um just
clarification

01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting some concern from people
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
about uh lines 13 and 16 where it moves
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
from committee to chairperson or
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
designated presiding officer the concern
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
is is is and it might be legitimate or
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
not that that chairperson now has to
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
much Authority and is almost in a
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
concern I don't believe it is no one
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
ever raised that issue in the
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings that we had that
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
we had we heard from members of the doe
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
we heard from members of the Public
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission we heard from
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
various other parties and that that
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
issue was never raised should it have
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
been should it have
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
been not to my not to my understanding
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
no fair enough thank
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington yeah just
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to be clear on this the the being the
 
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee is just an
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
administrative function only they get
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
one vote just like everybody else so
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing you don't have any extra
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
power it simply mean someone has to set
 
01:43:43.709 --> 01:43:43.719 align:start position:0%
up the scheduling and all the other
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
stuff and that's what themselves
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for so they they can't hold
 
01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
back a vote or anything like that I
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Wendy Thomas
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
please um don't speak unless you're
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
called on by the chair I I in my
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
experience there's always been a chair
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
and there's never been a situation where
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
the chair stood up and say we're not
 
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to vote on this and we're not
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
going to do that because the rest of the
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
committee could simply say well we are
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
and they' have if they have the votes
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
they can get it
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
done do you need to make a further
 
01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.199 align:start position:0%
comment now no I'm all set thank you
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to mention that
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
in those hearings um the amendment that
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
we were considering when we first uh
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
started the hearings had uh a different
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
person than the head of the Pu as the
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
chair of the SEC and so the amendment
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
that we were considering which I favored
 
01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh said that the um the appointed
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
attorney on the Public Utilities
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
Commission would be the chair of the SEC
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
and then there were several people who
 
01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
came up to testify saying that that
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
might not be administratively
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
a good a good thing but um many of the
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
people who I think proposed that and
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
myself included I didn't propose it but
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
I agreed that I thought that that
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
separation of of um of leadership would
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
have been a good thing so to your
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
question we did discuss it um there was
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
some opposition to it but it didn't
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
question well seeing none it looks like
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're ready to vote on the question of
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%

20 okay bye a vote of 20 to zero the
 
01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:22.910 align:start position:0%
20 okay bye a vote of 20 to zero the
committee

01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
adopts HB 609 as ought to pass as
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
amended with Amendment
 
01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.709 align:start position:0%
amended with Amendment
2368

01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
2368
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
H and while it would be tempting to put
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
this on the consent calendar I think it
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
would probably be pulled off by someone
 
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
so this will go on the regular calendar
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
and I will write the committee report
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
for HB
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
609 with that we'll close the public
 
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill b or the um
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
executive session rather on House Bill
 
01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:55.470 align:start position:0%
executive session rather on House Bill
20

01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
609 and we'll open a exec session on
 
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
616 and I will
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Harrington for
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%

616 representative Harrington do you
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
want to speak to your motion yeah very
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
very briefly we just inter studied uh
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
509 which deals with the same issue so
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's really no sense in having two
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
bills floating around and whatever
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
issues are uh in this could be uh taken
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
up if and when we decide to do something
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
with 509 so this this bill is not
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I guess we can
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
vote on the question of itl on House
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%

will write the committee

report and with that we'll close the
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
exec session on HB
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%

Amendment
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
so when we were having the committee
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
discussions on House Bill 2
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
281 this past
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
spring it was suggested that if the easy
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
board was repealed the statute covering
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
the easy board was repealed that it
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
might be wor worthwhile
 
01:50:07.530 --> 01:50:07.540 align:start position:0%
to try to capture some of
 
01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:10.390 align:start position:0%
to try to capture some of
[Music]

01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and some of the uh
 
01:50:16.589 --> 01:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
and other expertise of the people who
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
were on the energy board in another
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
fashion and it was suggested that the
 
01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
grid modernization Advisory Group which
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
had just been uh passed in an earlier
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
bill I think it was Senate Bill 166
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
might be a good place for um that to
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
happen so this bill or this amendment
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
rather creates within the grid
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
modernization Advisory Group the
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:50.589 align:start position:0%

622 FN as amended
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
by Amendment 2292 H by a vote of 20 to
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
nothing and this bill I think
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
also might benefit from being placed on
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar is there any
 
01:52:49.119 --> 01:52:51.229 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar is there any
objection

01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:52:51.239 --> 01:52:52.390 align:start position:0%
objection
seeing

01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
none it'll go on the consent calendar
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's as an FN so it may need to go
 
01:53:02.069 --> 01:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
there right can't go consent got to go
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
to fiscal first well that was the
 
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.550 align:start position:0%
to fiscal first well that was the
original

01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
bill that's true I'm not sure that the
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
amended bill needs to be FN I will
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
consult with the clerk and if the clerk
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
gives us permission we'll put it on the
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
and uh I will write the committee report
 
01:53:28.589 --> 01:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and with that we'll close
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
that executive session and now we're
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
down to our final executive session of
 
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
the day we've done remarkable work here
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
so far this morning so let's keep let's
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
keep it keep the role
 
01:53:48.510 --> 01:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
going I'll open the exec session on
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 6
 
01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
631 FN and I'll call on representative
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
Thomas for a motion thank you Mr chair
 
01:53:59.790 --> 01:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh motion on hb631 is
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
itl representative bernardy I second the
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
motion it's moved and seconded that we
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
judge House Bill 631 to be worthy of
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
itl Representative Thomas do you want to
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
comment on your motion yes Mr chair
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
um on the surface this bill would look
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
like it's okay cuz it's just a uh an
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
enabling bill it gives people options
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the bill talks
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
about smart meters and it doesn't again
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
we've had this discussion over the last
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
several many years doesn't really Define
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
what a smart meter is and then in
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
addition we learned that uh in order for
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
a smart meter to work the way that
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
people would like to work there are
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
additional um software and items that
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
need to be put behind it which which
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
don't exist right now and the utilities
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
especially eversource is not set up to
 
01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
provide that in that uh that that type
 
01:55:00.199 --> 01:55:00.950 align:start position:0%
provide that in that uh that that type
of

01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
support uh so we're looking at a bill
 
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
that would enable someone to get a smart
 
01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
meter if they want but if they get it
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
they really can't use it because there's
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
nothing behind it to support it and
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are very many analogies that are
 
01:55:19.069 --> 01:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
being made it's uh my analogy is like uh
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know selling someone 8K TV when you
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
only have 4K broadcasting capability
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's really not much of use and there
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
are other analogies out there that that
 
01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
can be used the same way so this bill
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
really doesn't add anything uh to the
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and in my opinion
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh just a useless bill so for that
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
it further discussion representative
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
McGee I I I didn't know if Dr crean
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak no she doesn't okay so
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
um this was really you know a priority
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill in that we were looking for a way
 
01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
to uh help folks get on the early
 
01:56:01.079 --> 01:56:02.189 align:start position:0%
to uh help folks get on the early
adoption

01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
adoption
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
bandwagon um and even fast follower
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
bandwagon uh with technology in a way
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
that was not mandated and so um the idea
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
that the bill is uh not specific enough
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of identifying what type of
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
smart meter Gateway devices would be
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate we are leaving like we often
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
do to the utilities who actually
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
understand uh what the landscape is out
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
there with these devices to the point
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
that if the utilities are not currently
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
set up to read those devices that it
 
01:56:39.149 --> 01:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
would uh not be a useful thing for
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
individuals to be able to adopt them
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
that is not what we have heard from
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
people who are already using smart uh
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway devices so there is a way
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
way there is a potential for if this
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill were passed we would be telling the
 
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
utilities that they need to accommodate
 
01:56:58.990 --> 01:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
this and then we would find that those
 
01:57:01.069 --> 01:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
Solutions do exist there are people that
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
are using them already they use them
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
with software applications that they can
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
download on their phone so they don't
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
need the utility to be able to help them
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
read that information and use that
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
information to do Energy Efficiency so I
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
I will not be voting to itl this bill I
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
will um still be looking OTP which is
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
what we had sort of discussed early on I
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
understand the points that are being
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
brought up but I don't think they're um
 
01:57:28.069 --> 01:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
they're sufficient to kill this bill and
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
make us delay
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
further representative
 
01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.589 align:start position:0%
further representative
Berney

01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
Berney
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
um I guess the the issue or the question
 
01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
I would have is so this isn't about
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
smart meter it's about Gateway devices
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
specifically um which which is the
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
device that goes after the smart meter
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
or connects to the smart meter and
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
allows the utility to control devices in
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
the home but if the utility doesn't have
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
a way to talk to that device or doesn't
 
01:57:59.069 --> 01:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
have any software it's not very useful
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh but even if like you said if if a
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
person has software themselves that they
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
run to control the device the device
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
would still need information from the
 
01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
utility like either if this if there's a
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
demand currently or um or what the price
 
01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:13.639 align:start position:0%
is of electricity right now but the
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
utility doesn't do Dynamic pricing or
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
Real Time pricing so there's no there's
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
no way to respond to the current price
 
01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
to to either turn things off or turn
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
them on um so I guess I'm not really
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
sure you said that there are users who
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
are using this can you give an example
 
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
of something that somebody's done with a
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
Gateway device in New Hampshire with a
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
utility that was beneficial sure I I
 
01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
guess you know eversource is is kind of
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
an outlier they're they're the largest
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
electricity supplier but they're not the
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
only electricity supplier and the New
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire co-op has had their customers
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
on meters with Gateway devices um and
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe Unitil also uh has
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
advanced metering and the capability to
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
provide people with additional
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
information there's also um a pending
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
docket at the Pu to approve the building
 
01:59:06.189 --> 01:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
of the the data Hub or the Statewide
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
energy data platform which would allow
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
people to access uh utility data uh slic
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
different ways and they wouldn't have to
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
get it necessarily through the utilities
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
directly so what this is doing is trying
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
to able technologies that will help us
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
get further down the road uh without
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
like I said further delay um people are
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
not going to buy these devices unless
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
they have a way that they want to use
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
them I would imagine that even the
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition is also uh
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
hoping that folks will advance the
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
technology so that they can have
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
something to tie
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
into and help people with monitoring
 
01:59:41.159 --> 01:59:42.550 align:start position:0%
into and help people with monitoring
their

01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
energy further representative
 
01:59:48.669 --> 01:59:48.679 align:start position:0%
Berne yeah I just so I think I remember
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
during dur during the hearings for this
 
01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill I think it was somebody from
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
eversource they mentioned that if if
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
this were to pass they would have to
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
spend money to re to Resource you know
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out which devices they're going
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
to use and then Provide support and make
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
sure that they can you know get enough
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
of those devices um and that that
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make sense if they don't
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
offer the service you know other other
 
02:00:12.669 --> 02:00:12.679 align:start position:0%
utilities might offer the service and it
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
makes sense for them to S device but if
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
a utility doesn't offer the service of
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
talking to the device what would be the
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
point of having them spend money and
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
procure these devices to offer them to
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
customers if there's no um if they don't
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
intend to or or don't currently offer
 
02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:27.350 align:start position:0%
intend to or or don't currently offer
the

02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
service representative McGee thanks um
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good question um and my
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that eversource
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
does have plans to eventually move
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
towards smarter meters than they have
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
now that
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh effort is a number of
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
years away
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
um but at this point if folks were able
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
to invest in their own individual
 
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
devices towards that effort they would
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision around what
 
02:00:58.510 --> 02:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
would be a standard that they could
 
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
settle on so that it would accommodate
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
that future technology that's kind of
 
02:01:05.149 --> 02:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
what we're asking them to do with the
 
02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:07.719 align:start position:0%
bill is to say you're not thinking about
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
this now but we want you to be thinking
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
about this now so that people can have
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
the option and they could certainly pass
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
through saying these are the these are
 
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
the meters that we advise you to have
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have them in stock
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh they just have to make sure that
 
02:01:26.069 --> 02:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
people know what they should be
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
buying representative Harrington did I
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
see your hand up
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
no uh representative
 
02:01:36.510 --> 02:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
crean thank you chair um I just wanted
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
to add my understanding is also that
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
eversource um in the other states where
 
02:01:44.069 --> 02:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
it operates does offer these devices and
 
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
it sort of just dragging its feet in New
 
02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:49.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it can um so I don't
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
think it would be the worst thing in the
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
world to push them a little bit here
 
02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.550 align:start position:0%
world to push them a little bit here
representative

02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair uh if if
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
ever source is going to make a move to
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
offer the this uh uh ability to connect
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh and provide this service then this
 
02:02:14.990 --> 02:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill is not necessary we've had Unitil
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
and we've had uh the power Cooperative
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.709 align:start position:0%
and we've had uh the power Cooperative
others

02:02:19.709 --> 02:02:19.719 align:start position:0%
others
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
put this service and capability out
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
there they didn't require any
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
legislation to do it I don't believe we
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
need to legislate in this area either we
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
let the market just move forward on its
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
own further discussion representative
 
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you
 
02:02:44.589 --> 02:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
chair I think what we have here is
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a trying to Define which one
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
is the cart and which one's the horse uh
 
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.310 align:start position:0%
is the cart and which one's the horse uh
Smart

02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
Smart
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
Meters as a means to getting us to uh
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
demand pricing is something that I see
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
is very necessary and I see demand
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
pricing is also something we need is
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
really try to flatten the curve that we
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
have and try to reduce demand so we
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
don't have all these power generators
 
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
always running in response what might be
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
a peak demand we need to flatten this
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
curve we need to minimize resources and
 
02:03:21.550 --> 02:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
by offering demand pricing we'll get
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
there now which one comes first the
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
smart meter or the uh decision that
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to develop these
 
02:03:33.069 --> 02:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
software I don't
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
have the ability to demand that ever
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
Source Begins the later process but this
 
02:03:42.549 --> 02:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
is something we can put in right now
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
saying that we can frontload this by
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill so I'll be voting
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
to support this bill thank
 
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Corman thank you Mr
 
02:03:56.549 --> 02:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just to to follow up on
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
representer Bernard's comment about
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
letting the market uh settle this
 
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
utility customers don't get to choose
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
their utility except if they move so you
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
know if I'm an eversource customer and I
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
want eversource to or and I want a smart
 
02:04:14.549 --> 02:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
meter Gateway device and ever Source
 
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
isn't providing one the only way I can
 
02:04:20.589 --> 02:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
get one is to move
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative bney
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just make one last comment so
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
if ever source for example takes another
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
three years to roll out the support for
 
02:04:31.229 --> 02:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
this and you buy a device this year Well
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
three years from now your device is
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
probably going to be outdated and
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
there's probably a better one to buy so
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
it makes sense that you buy the device
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
offered further discussion
 
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.990 align:start position:0%
offered further discussion
representative

02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
Bernardi so to follow up on uh
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative corman's comment the if
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
the customer base is interested in this
 
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
and presents their views to eversource
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
that will drive this we do not need to
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
do this by
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Wendy Thomas
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
um however if there's no incentive um
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
for the uh utilities to develop this um
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
capability because it will cost money
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
and they're not big on that
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know I see this bill as just
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
lighting a fire under the utilities and
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
saying you know build it now and they
 
02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:29.470 align:start position:0%
saying you know build it now and they
will

02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
come further discussion representative
 
02:05:35.549 --> 02:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
um the issue I have with this bill is
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
that there it appears to be a a a
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
presumption that naturally we want to go
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
to demand pricing and I don't think the
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
state has made that policy yet nor would
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
I support that per se so I I think I
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
would uh in in in in difference to the
 
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
the comments on technology I would have
 
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
to agree with representative BR that you
 
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
someone can go out and buy something now
 
02:06:08.109 --> 02:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
that's not usable now but might be
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
usable in five years it's going to find
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
out that whatever they bought is
 
02:06:14.189 --> 02:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
probably go is probably going to be OB
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
obsolete I don't think we should be in
 
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion I don't think we should be
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
trying to incentivize an idea that has
 
02:06:26.189 --> 02:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
not yet been adopted uh by the state
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
with a bill that would uh perhaps
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
artificially give people the impression
 
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
that we are going to do this and they'll
 
02:06:35.069 --> 02:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
go out and buy something on their own to
 
02:06:38.189 --> 02:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
find out that it's it's not being used
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
yet we need to wait until you know
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
policy is set and that we till we figure
 
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
out what we are going to do what makes
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
sense to do and that's the primary
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you Mr chairman well in my
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
opinion under the present regime where
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
you can separate your energy electricity
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
cost from the Transportation cost then
 
02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
this would require uh coordination
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
between your supplier as opposed to your
 
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh um uh Transportation co uh provider
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh because clearly if you're buying your
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
electricity from Joe independent
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
electricity company then that's the one
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
you'd have to coordinate with to do
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
utility representative
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh yeah just a newbie couple
 
02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
newbie questions one one I I understood
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
that eversource is the company that
 
02:07:41.229 --> 02:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
manages the grid period they buy
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
electricity from lots of other people
 
02:07:45.750 --> 02:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
but um if you wanted something like a
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
smart meter to work I mean wouldn't they
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
have to do it it the the second question
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
I see people saying no so maybe that's
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
not true the second question is when you
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
had discussions on this bill did
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
opinion so the answer to your first
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
question is ever source is the biggest
 
02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
utility in the state but they don't
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
manage the grid no one utility does the
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
answer to your second question is did
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
they testify yes they did and they were
 
02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill at when they
 
02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:20.750 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill at when they
testified

02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
further

02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
Summers I guess my biggest question I'm
 
02:08:31.629 --> 02:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
kind of relaying off of what kind of
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
what JD said earlier was is without this
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
legislation we've had multiple utilities
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
be able to enable and apply smart
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
metering devices to folks homes and they
 
02:08:46.549 --> 02:08:46.559 align:start position:0%
were able to do that without any
 
02:08:49.629 --> 02:08:49.639 align:start position:0%
legislation whatsoever and from my
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is this bill basically
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
pointing to one utility and so the we're
 
02:08:56.950 --> 02:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
asking the state to tell this one
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
utility what to do and is that the only
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill representative mck
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you chair um I just
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out two really important
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
things first uh we're in a captive
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
market and so the decisions that we the
 
02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
members of st&amp; make actually do have an
 
02:09:17.709 --> 02:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
impact on the market and that's part of
 
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
our job as elected representatives to
 
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
make Market changes so that certainly is
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
something that's underlying the entire
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
discussion about this bill is do we want
 
02:09:29.549 --> 02:09:29.559 align:start position:0%
to force one of the players in the
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
market to make a change uh the second
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
piece I think is just as important um
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is people who
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
are on the cutting or potentially even
 
02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
bleeding edge okay so when we talk risk
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
reward the people who are taking a risk
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill are individual citizens
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who are deciding they
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
want to spend their own money and get a
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
smart Dev advice and they want to find
 
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
out what that means and perhaps even
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
change their behavior that's their risk
 
02:09:55.549 --> 02:09:55.559 align:start position:0%
and so they take that risk for the next
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
three or 5 years and Technology can
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
change and it be becomes Obsolete and we
 
02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
all know that's just the way of the
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
world but nonetheless the risk is on the
 
02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:05.559 align:start position:0%
individual purchaser we're not forcing
 
02:10:07.149 --> 02:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
anything we're not increasing costs
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're not spreading this out across
 
02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
other people and saying oh we want to
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
support this effort by making everyone
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
pay more so some people can get smart
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
devices that's not what we're doing
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking for a recommendation
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
specific from ever source for what smart
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
meter device they think people should
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
purchase if and when they take their own
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
risk and make that purchase and for that
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
reason I absolutely support this bill
 
02:10:29.310 --> 02:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
because we should be pushing the market
 
02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.990 align:start position:0%
because we should be pushing the market
thank

02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I I'm sorry I can't support
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation and uh the reason for
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
that is I think it's wrong-headed uh I
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
just think it's not our job to
 
02:10:45.149 --> 02:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
micromanage utilities and tell them what
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
products they need to be offering their
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
their customers I think if we want to
 
02:10:51.069 --> 02:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
change the market that's what our job is
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
as a legislature and that is to change
 
02:10:55.149 --> 02:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
the way the market functions and I'm a
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
strong believer that demand side
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
response is an important component in
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
saving people's money and lowering the
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh the climate implications of the way
 
02:11:07.069 --> 02:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
we use energy so if we want demand side
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
to be a part of the way the market
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
functions that's our job as a
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislature is to set that up so that's
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's how it functions not by telling
 
02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
utilities to offer a certain product to
 
02:11:20.430 --> 02:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
a particular class of customers and
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
putting all the weight of changing the
 
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
way the energy system functions on a
 
02:11:26.910 --> 02:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
group of pioneering customers who are
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
going to you know change the world
 
02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
work representative
 
02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I guess maybe I'm a
 
02:11:37.229 --> 02:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
little confused at what the bill is
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish it talks about
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
putting in smart meat is undefined
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what that that that is and
 
02:11:45.149 --> 02:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
whether is any software that has to be
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
required with that and how it's used but
 
02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
as long as we don't don't have time of
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
day rates if you're paying whatever it
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
is let's just make it up 20 cents a
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour 247 all the time uh having
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
a smart meter I'm not sure what it's
 
02:12:02.189 --> 02:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
doing for you because you're are going
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
to get your power delivered that way and
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be paying a variable
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
rate with time I don't know of any uh
 
02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:11.559 align:start position:0%
supplier now that says we'll I mean
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
there's some very large industrial
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
suppliers that go into the market
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
themselves and they do buy time of day
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
and the studies I've indicate shows that
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's there's a significant savings
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
there but we're talking about large
 
02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
industrial users here for residential
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
homeowner they'll have a smart meeter
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
what is it going to do for them because
 
02:12:30.549 --> 02:12:30.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay the same price of
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
power whether it's 12:00 noon or 12
 
02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
midnight or whatever so I'm just not
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
sure what this
 
02:12:39.310 --> 02:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
accomplishes further discussion
 
02:12:42.549 --> 02:12:42.559 align:start position:0%
representative ner thank you Mr chairman
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
um since we have Representatives on the
 
02:12:46.549 --> 02:12:46.559 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
um what are would like to um tell
 
02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
eversource what to do would it be
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time to ask the
 
02:12:55.229 --> 02:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
eversource representative or lobbyist to
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
come to the mic to give us a refresher
 
02:13:01.149 --> 02:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
but is there any further
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative bney thank you
 
02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I guess uh I have a question
 
02:13:16.750 --> 02:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
so if if the purpose of this is to
 
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
encourage eversource to to at some point
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
provide the um real-time pricing or to
 
02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
provide software that will then talk to
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
the Gateway device wouldn't it make
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
sense to legislate then requiring to do
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
that as opposed to requiring them to
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
offer a device that doesn't
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
work good question representative crean
 
02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe the problem with that is
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
the chicken and egg that we were talking
 
02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
about before so if we ask them to do
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
that then they'll say well we can't
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
possibly do that because people don't
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
have Smart Meters um so this is just
 
02:13:53.069 --> 02:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
again a way to allow people to express
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
they want this information they want to
 
02:13:57.549 --> 02:13:57.559 align:start position:0%
be able to engage in this pricing and
 
02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully encourage ever source to be
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
responsive to
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
that all right we seem to be going back
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
and forth back and forth here unless
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
there's a a real uh pressing need I see
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
no need for further discussion I think
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
we should just take a vote and see uh
 
02:14:17.709 --> 02:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
let the chips fall May where they may
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
and any objection to
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
that representative n just one more
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
point that I don't think anybody said is
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
anytime we ask like if we ask ever
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
source to tell them that they have to
 
02:14:31.709 --> 02:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
spend this money to recoup their cost we
 
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
all have to pay for it it's just going
 
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
to raise our
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
rates good point okay representative
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
McGee did you have a final Point yeah I
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
mean the whole point of the bill is that
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's the individuals who would spend the
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
money if they want to have a smarter
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
meter than what they have today it isn't
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
on all the rate payers to do that if
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
there are peripheral costs you know that
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
could that's something that we could
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
assess but that is not the idea of this
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
bill the idea of this bill is that
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
people who want Smart Meters would be
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
able to invest in the technology and
 
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
then there would be less of a expense
 
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
for all rate payers at the time when
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
eversource decides to transition us over
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
so the because the infrastructure would
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
already be partially
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
upgraded okay I think uh We've exhausted
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion topics on this bill so
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see us vote so I'm going to
 
02:15:27.549 --> 02:15:27.559 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role on the
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%

02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
631 and now I'll ask the committee if
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
there is any other business that they
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
would like to address while we're here
 
02:17:35.399 --> 02:17:37.230 align:start position:0%
would like to address while we're here
today

02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
because after we leave here today we
 
02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
won't be reconvening until after the 1
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
of January so is there any other
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%

02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
it representative cren um just wanted to
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
take the chance to thank everybody who
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
worked on all this legislation in the
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
interim especially 609 coming to a
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
resolution on that Big Bill appreciate
 
02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
it thanks representative Harrington yeah
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative Corman and myself are
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to get together and find
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
something to agree on a lot because
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise the Patriots are going to lose
 
02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:27.389 align:start position:0%
otherwise the Patriots are going to lose
every

02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
game although you guys don't know if
 
02:18:31.629 --> 02:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
that strategy works because it worked
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
once but it didn't work the other
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
time take 50% it's worth a try it's
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
worth a try they need all the help they
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
can get representative Corman thank you
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%

very very hard and
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
diligently to uh put together the the
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
final version of that Amendment and I
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
think uh I really look forward to moving
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
it to the Senate and seeing uh if we can
