00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
pledge

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
all right again welcome to
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation before we get started on
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
our executive session on our final three
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
bills thank
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
you uh last time we were here on the
 
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
31st I mentioned the formation of a
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee within the within our
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
committee and all committees to overlook
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
rules on a regular basis uh to make sure
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
that the rules that are being adopted
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
follow the intent of the legislation
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's being passed so I said I'd look
 
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.269 align:start position:0%
that's being passed so I said I'd look
for

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
volunteers however in the meantime I was
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
told by the speaker office they need
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
names yesterday so I picked four people
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
oh who I thought would be
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
competent and more than eager to
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
participate in these subcommittees so
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
I'll mention the four that I've selected
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
and obviously if there's a problem let
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
me know I can make changes uh but
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%

Gorski I knew I was going to get that
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
smile but it's better than a hit uh
 
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.990 align:start position:0%
smile but it's better than a hit uh
representative

00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
like to speak a little bit to it thank
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um one of my big
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
concerns here with u hp375 is with
 
00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
further testimony that we had uh several
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
weeks ago um I was quite concerned with
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
the lack of a vetting process the
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
temporary kind of vetting process was
 
00:24:52.389 --> 00:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
not necessarily full extensive which
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
gets me concerned of we don't know who's
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
really here um in our state and for that
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
I'm very very concerned and I can't
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
really support this
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you sir anybody else from the
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
SES so I I hear your concern but I think
 
00:25:16.909 --> 00:25:16.919 align:start position:0%
the the a broader picture of way to look
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
at this is that um several points I
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
would make uh one is that under the real
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
id id procedures for instance the
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
federal government recogniz IES uh
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
filing for Asylum as a criteria that
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
would allow driver licenses to be issued
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
um not just for a temporary one like
 
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
this bill provides but for one that uh
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
matches for a normal uh course of
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
however long their permissioned to
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
remain in the United States uh is valid
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
for this bill is very limited in its
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
scope and it tries to take into
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
consideration of the fact that some of
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
the recent data that we've heard is that
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
um requests for Asylum are
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
taking uh decades literally to have
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
their hearings their formal hearings in
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
the meantime though persons who put in
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
requests for Asylum are required to fill
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
out paperwork where they say where they
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
came from why they came to the United
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
States what the basis of their Asylum
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
request was
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
for um and as a matter of course they
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
would receive a work permit which would
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
then allow them to get a driver's
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
license anyways the problem exists
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
that um under our current statutes a
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
person who moves in who lives in New
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of which an asy requestor
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
could be a citizen of this state
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
they are only they are required to get a
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
driver's license after I think IT
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
director correct me if I'm wrong but 60
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
days um and yet they can't because they
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
can't meet the
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
requirements And yet when they get their
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
work permit they can meet the
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
requirements and then they are duly
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
issued a New Hampshire driver's license
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
the problem is that even work permits
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
now are backed up to taking over a year
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes as much as 18
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
months and so even this bill
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was only looking at the
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
the oneyear delay but we're not
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
even we're not even being able to this
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
won't even be a full fix anymore but the
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
but the point is
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
um these folks are here
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
legally they have filled out the
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate paperwork and have been
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
temporarily vetted and then after one
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
used to be one year now it's a little
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
longer they are automatically
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
given um a work permit which then allows
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
them to get a driver's license I don't
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
see where this is such a heavy lift
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
where we're only trying to close the gap
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
between when you are required to get a
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
driver's license but
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
can't and are allowed to get a driver's
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
license and can't there's that Gap in
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is attempting to
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
do and I again I don't see it as a big
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
heavy lift and I would urge my
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support um not support the
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
itl motion so that a further motion
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
made anybody else from the committee
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
so representative Sykes I heard you say
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
a couple things there that the person
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
that came over the Border has given
 
00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:55.630 align:start position:0%
that came over the Border has given
their

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
information from where they're from from
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
and you know they're they're they're
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
pertinent information to the government
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
government but they came over the Border
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't come in through the
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
checkpoints necessarily that okay all
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
right then the other part I want to
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
bring up is as you said it's this is not
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
a full fix this this bill won't totally
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
fix it so we're not we don't have a bill
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's totally baked yet it's not going
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
to it's only going to partially fix
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
something it's it's it's not going to be
 
00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.669 align:start position:0%
something it's it's it's not going to be
all

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
there if I could respond you want to
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
okay representative SES I let you reply
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative CIS for those
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions so one of the things I think
 
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.590 align:start position:0%
questions so one of the things I think
that

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
um we should be mindful of and this is
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
why I think it's really important too is
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
a Sil people who uh apply for asylum in
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
the United States who have filed the
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessary paperwork in order to get
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
themselves on a list so that they can
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
have a hearing
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
are incredibly mindful of how lucky they
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
are to be here they're incredibly
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
mindful of how careful they must be
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
because for the slightest reason their
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
ay request could be
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
denied and they don't want to do that
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
and so they are literally model citizens
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
and we we just there is virtually no
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
data showing that a s requests holders
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
of driver's licenses in this state or
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
any other state are a problem to Public
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
Safety or to furthering their need to
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
work and support their family and um to
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
make sure their children get to school
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
and they do all the things that
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
everybody would want a person who was
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
newly arrived in this country to do and
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
we know we live in a state New Hampshire
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
where public transportation is rare
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
enough anyways but in rural areas it's
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
incredibly rare and they are stuck in a
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
in a catch 22 that we could fix um this
 
00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
um anybody else from the committee rip
 
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.190 align:start position:0%
um anybody else from the committee rip
resentative

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
resentative
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
chair we have a couple of statutes that
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
are in conflict and I'm just not going
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
to support a change to one without
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
fixing the whole problem the nature of
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
the conflicts is 263 39a is a standalone
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
statute as is 26340 a 26340 a says that
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
an applicant for a driver's license who
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
has not previously been licensed to
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
drive a motor vehicle in the state shall
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
provide his or her social security
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
application the applicant shall be given
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to determine whether or
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
not to have his social security number
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
retained in the records but that it's
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
explicit you have to have the social
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
a which is the statute that the bill
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
updates talks about people who probably
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
don't have a Social Security number so
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
how how do you allow these two to stand
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
when we have conf statutes that are in
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with each other often
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
the courts get involved because we
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
didn't straighten it out and in terms of
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
agency Administration a common practice
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
is you look at which one was updated
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
last and go with that and in this
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
case driver's licenses license
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
Reciprocity for aliens temporarily
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
residing in New Hampshire was last
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
updated June 21st 2003 the social
 
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
security number required statute was
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
August 8 20 9 I would really like to see
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
that fixed first another problem with 26
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
339a is we're creating a new
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
documentation requirement with this bill
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
but we're not getting rid of the other
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
ones in 263
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
39a they talk about the eligible people
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral 1 and now in Roman
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 which is the real mess the
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
director may require any of the
 
00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:28.590 align:start position:0%
director may require any of the
following

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
and lowercase b is submission of social
 
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
security number or if the person does
 
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
not qualify for such a number the
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
submission of certification to that
 
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
effect as is acceptable to the
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner so how does the new Bill
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
affect that because that's standing
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
because it isn't a strikeout in the bill
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
and by the way the list of documentation
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
here most of which is proving that the
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
person actually knows how to drive
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's all optional now I believe the
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
director is trying to figure out if
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
these people can drive but he's not
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
required to and that's another problem
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
um he doesn't have to ask for any of
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
these so I'm just not going to support
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
an update to 263 39a which is a real
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
chair one more one more bite at it
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative SES well um I
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
respectfully to representative Smith
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
when one receives their work permit they
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
are also eligible and can get a Social
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
Security number at that time and so when
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
they go to the DMV they have a work
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
permit and a social security number that
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
will support their request for a
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license so
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted you to know that that
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
that that is part of the process for
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
them anybody go ahead representa Smith
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you clarify question so you you
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
said work permit but this deals with
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
just filling out an application for
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
Asylum status so you're saying at that
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
moment they're eligible for a social
 
00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:09.470 align:start position:0%
moment they're eligible for a social
security

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
number no no I didn't say that no I
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
believe when he said when they get a
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
work permit they'll be assigned a social
 
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.750 align:start position:0%
work permit they'll be assigned a social
security

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
number thank you Mr chair representative
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
um I'd be opposed to the itl um
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
I think we have protections built in
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
especially in uh section D um where it
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
says written acknowledgement of receipt
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
from United States citizenship and
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
Immigration Services shall Pro be
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
provided with the license application so
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
that means there is some vetting going
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
on and also we have the another
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
protection where a driver's license
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
issued pursuant to this sub paragraph
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
shall be valid for 180 days so they have
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
to go through I believe they have to go
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
through that whole same process again 18
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
180 days
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
later so we do have some
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
protections I I'll chime in at this
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
point just to clarify a few things based
 
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
on the research I've been doing uh when
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
you do when when a person comes through
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
a Port of Entry uh they're given
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
basically just a receipt uh and at that
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
time they are being told they are
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
lawfully present in the United States
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
because they entered through a Port of
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
Entry but that's all they've got uh to
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
pursue Asylum uh they have to continue
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
on their own that application
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
process what and that's only an
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
application what this bill seeks to do
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
is give them allow them to get a license
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
merely by applying for Asylum there is
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
no vetting that that takes that takes
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
place in that Asylum hearing so in
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
today's world I don't know why um it's
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
it's hard to see that the
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
mere applying for something is adequate
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
proof of vetting I don't see that it is
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
the the other and so I'm I'm happy with
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
it is I will not be supporting this the
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
other thing that I'll mention on the 180
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
days this was brought up in the original
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
hearing as a problem um only because
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
you're right if it's a year or better
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
before the work permit starts kicking in
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
these people could potentially get a
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
license for 180 days if this were to
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
pass then they would have none and then
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
I guess they have to go without driving
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
after they've been driving for 180 days
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh until they did get a work permit and
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
that whole process kicked in so so that
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's that was a problem that was
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
identified with this bill on day one uh
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
so that's another reason why I won't be
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
supporting it either uh anybody else
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the millions uh but but I
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%

even more uh
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
Privileges and beside the vetting issue
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
that we've kind of discussed um
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill one of the things
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
that caught my eye was on the dhs.gov
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
website under real ID one of the things
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
it states is that real ID allows
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
compliance states to issue driver's
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
licenses and identification cards where
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
the identity of the applicant cannot be
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
assured or for whom lawful presence is
 
00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.910 align:start position:0%
assured or for whom lawful presence is
not

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
determined that to me is a big huge red
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
flag that to me um screams that there's
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
not effective vetting in regards to this
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
whole P process and for that I cannot
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
SES well
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I guess I the the I do have an
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment if we get that far but um I
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
will suggest that um anytime
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
we can help the DMV and help the
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire to be
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
um compliant with reasonable federal
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
laws that's a that's a step that we
 
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
should take and this the amendment that
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
I have um does just that it brings Nampa
 
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.870 align:start position:0%
I have um does just that it brings Nampa
law

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
into uh conformance with uh federal law
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the requirements for the
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
issuance of a real ID it's as simple as
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
that and um I I just see that it's a way
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
that we should be going rather than
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
trying continuing to be um outliers in
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the way that we look at real
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
people anybody else from the
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
sellers Mr chair um I'm just reading
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
here a little bit and I'm just not check
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
my emails I'm I'm looking at this and it
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
says the real ID Act was uh in 2005 but
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
it started it came out of because of the
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
911 issue that we went that we had in
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
911 right and therefore we're trying to
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
make sure we know the identification of
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
these people to getting these IDs and I
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
don't think that's actually happening at
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
the border we we're not getting that
 
00:43:51.079 --> 00:43:54.309 align:start position:0%
the border we we're not getting that
information

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily are you trying to say say
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
that federal law doesn't make any
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
sense rhetorically anybody else from the
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh you know uh for all the
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
same reasons I was opposed to 375 again
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
um I I do agree I was Jo joking a minute
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
ago real ID was put in place for
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
security purposes so we know who's who
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
but yet you read some of the the uh the
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
AC acceptable reasons for getting a
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
license it goes in the opposite
 
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
direction uh I'll leave it as simple as
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
that that I'll encourage the committee
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
to vote no on this it's way too vague uh
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I think we should leave it alone
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
and this does basically on line D bring
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
it up to the standards of the real ID
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
Act of 2005 Public Law
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
10913 so I'll leave it at that with
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
nobody else from the committee I'll ask
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%

licenses due to non-payment of fines or
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
fees chair recognizes representative C
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
for a motion
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
motion is to interim
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
study represent C moves interim study is
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
Smith representative C care to speak to
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
your motion uh yes um this bill may have
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh may be appropriate if the conditions
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
for suspension were more carefully
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
written as it is a person with a fine
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
for a driving infraction could not have
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
their driving privileges suspended and
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
this is the most direct reason for
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
having a suspension is of driving
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
privileges for driving
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
violations um also consider that this
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
would only punish New Hampshire drivers
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
with uh reciprocity we can only suggest
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
to other states that they do so it may
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
not be in their priority to do so on
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
minor fines and stuff like that
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else from the
 
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
SES yeah so
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
um I would be in support of a interim
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
study bill because I think there is work
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to do um uh there are there
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
are members of this committee who have
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
supported uh not supported other
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislation which was taking driver's
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
privileges away for non-driver related
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.270 align:start position:0%
privileges away for non-driver related
um

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh issues and we are we are I think uh
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
in support of the concept that we should
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh decouple you know uh loss of driver's
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
license because of issues that are not I
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
mean there are some federal laws that we
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
can't change and shouldn't change uh
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
child support being an example of one of
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
those but I think we could do more and
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
we can do better
 
00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
um and so I I I'm hopeful that the
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
committee can uh pass the motion as it
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%

you everybody again uh that is our final
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
bill for the year we have our rules
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
committee set up our subcommittee set up
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't have anything else anything
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
for the good of the
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
cause have a great hollow representative
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair if I may on the
 
00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:39.799 align:start position:0%
um the rules subcommittee so we had
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
we've had some issues come up with
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
committees that already have those up in
 
00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
working not producing a work
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
product the job is to produce a work
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
product and the question is probably a
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
little difficult for some it doesn't
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
matter if you like the underlying law or
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
not that's not your job and if you can't
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
separate that you're not suited for the
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the idea is to look at what
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
the existing law is and make sure the
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
rules consistent with it even if it's a
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
law you hate so you kind of have to
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
divorce your personal feelings about the
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
law from the process which is just does
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
the rule support the intent of the
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
legislation so I would ask the committee
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
please keep that in your mind as you go
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
through this it's not an opportunity to
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
