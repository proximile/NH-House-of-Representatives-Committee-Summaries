new members of the committee um the

organization uh procedures guidelines
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
and procedures basically address two
 
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
issues one is how items come to the
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
committee from the agencies telling the
 
00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
agencies that they need to provide our
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
office you know within two weeks of the
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
meeting with the materials that they
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
want to come before this meeting if
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's a need for a late item that they
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
need to make a request to the chair the
 
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
second portion of this is um two year in
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
the last budget the capital um budget
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
overview committee was changed the
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
capital project overview committee and
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
as part of that there's a quarterly
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
report report that's um provided to this
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee through dep Department of
 
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
administrative services and this
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
committee put some guard rails up for
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
lack of a a better term in terms of what
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
you want capital projects to be worth
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
before they get included on this report
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what these guidelines are um
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
intended to provide the committee as
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
well as the agencies so that you didn't
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
end up with $50,000 projects being
 
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
reported on a quarterly basis when you
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
didn't really need need or want them
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%

2024 m Mr Shay help us um so this is the
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
corly report that we I just referenced
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the organizational materials
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
so the department of administrative
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
Services compiles all the capital
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
projects around the state um within the
 
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
limit guidance of the procedures you
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
just adopted you'll see the the long 8
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
and 1 half by 14 page that would be
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
considered the old capital budget report
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
that you used to get at the last couple
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
pages are the new projects that were
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
included when this became a capital
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
project overview and then the large
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
pages in the back are all dot projects
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
that are a million dollars or more that
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
um they're now reporting I'd like to um
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
just let the committee know as well that
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
the governor's trailer Bill does propose
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
to make this a annual report versus a
 
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
quarterly report so um just be aware of
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
that because it will be in house bill to
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
it if the committee has some feelings
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
related to that they should um probably
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
let Finance members know in the house or
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the Senate if it passes the
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
house any
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions Senator Waters please thank
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I I wondered if I might
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
just ask a couple questions about some
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
projects and if you could answer me
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
later or or now um I wondered uh what
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
the status was of the be the rebid for
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture and
 
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
um I also would if you could get an
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
update on the construction of the um
 
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
woodworking facility at the state
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
prison and
 
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.430 align:start position:0%
prison and
um

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.030 align:start position:0%
um
then

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
um the pier projects at Peas the one was
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done in February and I I
 
00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
just I don't think I'd seen that but if
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
you could just check on both the
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
projects the peas
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
projects um and for the prison what was
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
the question for that one well are what
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
is the status of those they were
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done I haven't heard if
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
they're done or not of the not the pe's
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
then I'll send an email to the full
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee as to what I've gotten from
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
each of the agencies Mr chairman by
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
welome any other questions Senator Lang
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
so I I'm interested in the projects that
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
are all on hold what's going to happen
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
next like I'm looking at one for
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
do um about a roof or something about a
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
Grant application it's on page uh no
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
page numbers on this thing but anyway um
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's a $4 million ask that was forwarded
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
the balance is forward the balance of
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
available just says Grant application
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
was unsuccessful funds available to
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
pursue future discretionary grant
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities what does that mean
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
because apparently we we put this money
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
out there for something Market
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
Street uh I don't I can't just CER their
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
thing so I'd be interested in at least a
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
a quarterly report on all the projects
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
that were on hold from the previous
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
quarter what's the new update um rather
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
than just dump it in here because I have
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
no idea what this it says it's on hold
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
it says the completion date was last
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
month or
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
December but the money is still
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
available so that's the kind of thing
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in if we put a project on
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
hold for whatever reason what's the next
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
step and did status change from the
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
previous previous report yeah we can U
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
make that request now the agencies
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
provide administrative Services if you
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
look at the the spreadsheet on page one
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
for instance that's a framework where
 
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
the agencies provide information from
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
the comments over yep everything in the
 
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
left side of that comes from the um
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
statement of Appropriations
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
system so administrative Services
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
will'll try to get comments from the
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
agencies the agencies don't always
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
provide those but if the based on this
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
committee wanting to know a certain
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
status we can certainly ask for that to
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
be provided and if they can't provide it
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
we'll ask them to come to the committee
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
and explain what's going on I I I'm I'm
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
interested in all the things that were
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
on hold those are things we either
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
budgeted for and aren't doing anything
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
with right now and i' be interested in
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
KN what the plan is for it um or if it
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
was on hold last month and it's moving
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
forward now just let me hey this one
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
came off hold and it's now so it's
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
cleaner than I'm looking at this it's
 
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
awful lot of columns and numbers right
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
and um to to this specific example that
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
you had that was discretionary money
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
that was put in the capital budget two
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
cycles ago um so the the department of
 
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation had indicated at that
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
time that
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's federal government has different
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
grants popping up and the state's not
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for those because they don't
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
have a matching funding source so there
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
was a desire at that time for the
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
capital budget to have some money in it
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
um I think it was $4 million to to to
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
try to get those last Capital last time
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
when the capital budget was being built
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
the agency reported that those
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
discretionary um
 
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
programs um we didn't win any of those
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
grants we weren't awarded any of those
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
grants and so we continued to carry the
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
money forward so what you with a lot of
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
these hold projects and and all these
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
projects when you get the capital budget
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
itself when you start working on the
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget within the house and in
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate there's all these laps
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
extensions in the back which a lot of
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
these projects that are on hold will
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
probably be in there and why each one's
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
on hold varies but we can certainly try
 
00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
to get some better information thank you
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
yep Senator gray I'd like to get the
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions attached to
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
the minutes so that it will remain in
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the so that you know it'll be part of
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
the record um I think that's a prudent
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
thing to
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
do representative F thank you Mr chair I
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
also have concerns about the hp2
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
switching from quar uh quarterly to
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
annual but I have a specific question U
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
regarding the closed loop referral
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
contract that you you and I have
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
discussed going back to last summer
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
which part of the funding comes out of
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
the capital projects and specifically
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
relates the quarterly reporting
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
guidelines that make mention of when we
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
get reported on that regarding the
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars except other than
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget blah blah blah is that is
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
that s that piece of money in here it
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
probably would be in the neighborhood of
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know 2 and a half or $3 million
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
because it's half of the actual
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
contract so so I I don't know the answer
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
to that we without looking at some of
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
the detail um I don't what we're showing
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
is they they they show the appropriation
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
for the capital projects they don't
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily show you what's been
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
contracted per se they do show you
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
what's been expended and what's been
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
encumbered but we wouldn't know was it
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
due to a contract or was it due to um
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
actual work that was done by public
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
works or um we we would have to each
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
project get the detail related to that
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
so if there's a specific question well
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
the frustration I want to just Express
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee I'm not sure and I'm
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
not very familiar with this committee
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
but I am familiar with this particular
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
thing um there was this contract which
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
when through quite a cycle I won't go
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
through all the details back to the you
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
know the co times and was finally let
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
last year after like three efforts um
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
but the interesting thing about it it
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
was only maybe six S8 millionar in DHHS
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
however a big piece of that came out of
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
a capital projects budget Medicaid
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
budget from four years ago uh from two
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
years ago from the last uh term another
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
big piece of it came out of another
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
large piece a different place and
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
another large another half million
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
dollars came out of Veterans Affair
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
military something veterans home I guess
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
maybe it was so I'm concerned that these
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
especially DHHS but maybe it's a general
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
a more General thing that contracts are
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
getting let and the legislator is never
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
hearing about them this one was never
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
heard in the legislature house or Senate
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
in any of the presentations that were
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
given either the capital projects
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee or to DHHS where I was which I
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
was serving that finance committee for a
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
number of six years so I just wanted to
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
find out make make people aware there's
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
an issue here that I'd like to be able
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative eel well as long as we're
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
on the subject of of projects on hold I
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
would say six to eight years ago there
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
was money appropriated for upgrading the
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
parking lot at Sunapee State Beach um
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
and it's funny I had several
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
constituents call me about this uh in
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
the last couple of weeks and I see it
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
right here it says no info on Project
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
list for
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
this so maybe you could inquire we can
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
and and that comment would be because
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
the agency didn't respond back to
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
administrative Services I know I know
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
which is even more concerning thank
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Shay I think we uh as a committee
 
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
we've noticed that having this quarterly
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
report go to a annual report would not
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
be in our best interests so I don't know
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
how we have to work around the fact that
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
the governor wants it annually because
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
we I think would certainly be better
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
served having this report
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
quarterly so a suggestion I might make
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
is that um the chair of this committee
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
could let the chair of Finance who also
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
serves on this committee know that you
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
would like a house bill two amendment to
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
remove that section and our office could
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
assist the chair with
 
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
that represent wer did you hear that
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
thumbs up thumbs up for the record from
 
00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:24.549 align:start position:0%
thumbs up thumbs up for the record from
representative

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
W Mr chair and it is going to division
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
one so we have some control over the
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
operation up to up to a point any other
 
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
operation up to up to a point any other
questions

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.070 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
Edgar uh thank you Mr chair said eil
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
again representative
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
Edgar yeah I um the question I have it's
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
a general one and uh it it has to do
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
with Appropriations that we got and
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
money we were promised from the federal
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
government I just want to know if in
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
fact anything that we've been planning
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
to use is being withdrawn and if any is
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawn I we I think I'd like to be
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
notified we committee notified about it
 
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.270 align:start position:0%
notified we committee notified about it
right

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
away we haven't been made aware that
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
there's any projects in Jeopardy at this
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
time but as we get information we would
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
certainly share with the committee thank
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
you represent I'm sorry Senator gray
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
close enough you
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
know um the committee does have the
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
ability to for any of the Departments
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
that are not not providing responses for
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
the minutes of this or for this report
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
to ask them to attend and provide that
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
input in person okay and that is usually
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
a very good incentive for them to
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
actually provide the report ahead of
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
time so um again as as the chair and you
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
know for our staff uh I think that that
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
should be the policy of this committee
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
is that if there is a Department that
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
has not provided input that they be
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
asked to attend and explain duly
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
noted if I might just um piggyback on
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
that comment it that's true for any
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
project this committee can bring any
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
agency into this meeting at any time to
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
get an update or ask questions about any
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
project you might be interested in so
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
for instance if Senator Waters wasn't
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the responses I was able
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
to get at the next meeting we could ask
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
those agencies to come in and be ready
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
to explain expl what's going on we've
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
done that with um the Hatchery we've
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
done it with other projects in the past
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
the um um Environmental Services uh One
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
Stop has come in a couple of times to
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
explain what their status is of that
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
project so if this Committee just has a
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
desire to bring a certain project before
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
it and have the agency explain it that
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
that can happen well before the
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports come to you so I just
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that very clear and we're
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
happy to invite them for you thank you
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
I had a question around the uh $25
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
million design build limits for the
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
do and there's that's the maximum that
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
they can do a design build on and I was
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
trying to look in statute as to when
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
that number had been set and so would it
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
be um possible to to inquire with
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
DOT um as to whether or not with
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
inflation and everything else it might
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
make sense to increase that amount and I
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
don't you know I don't know whether you
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
know whether you have any thoughts about
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
that but I I don't that would be
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
certainly a question we wish we would
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
ask do in terms of the size of the
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
projects and the scope of projects that
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
they deal with if that $25 million
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
causes any um delays or or barriers to
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
getting projects done um but certainly
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
happy to reach out to do and find out
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman any other
 
00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative wer when we uh
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
last budget we talked about putting 40
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
million aside for 10 years so we'd have
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
400 million to build a new
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
prison I don't remember whether that was
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget or the regular
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
budget do you regular is a regular
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
budget I think that was in the regular
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
budget all right because it the governor
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
leaves it
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
out thank you Mr
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
Shay so right now the Department of
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections has $50 million to um use to
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
to design and and get an architectural
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
schematic of the potential future prison
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
um they're using the first $10 million I
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
believe to to make sure that the
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
property um behind the women's prison is
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
is uh feasible for putting the new Men's
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
prison um and then the other 40 million
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated to them would be
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
used to do a um design schematic um that
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
could be used for bidding purposes I say
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
that because that there may not be a
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
need for additional Appropriations this
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
cycle and maybe that's why it wasn't
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
included but that would certainly be a
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
question for the capital uh budget
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
committee to ask um when they come
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
before you in the next couple weeks um
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
house than any other questions
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative eel it's not a question
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
but it's just a comment when I didn't
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
see the appropriation for Corrections in
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
the regular in the operations budget I
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
did look right away into the capital
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
budget and there's it's not it's not
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
there it's just more upkeep right
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
correct Mr Shay have you got all your
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions and everything lined up so far
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
that you think you've
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
got I think so but it looks like Senator
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
Lang may have something else Senator L
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking number one this is a
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
great little hand guide this Capital
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
this this uh legislative review uh 001
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
on and this is more comment for my the
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
finance chairs happen to be sitting in
 
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
the room when I look at page 12 and I'm
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the use of toll credits
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
interesting enough this committee's got
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
to approve any use of toll credits and
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about a sound barrier we
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
talked about last year in a budget
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
process to use toll credits for the
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
purchase of a sound barrier and yet in
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
this under here I'm not sure we could
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
have done that without approval of this
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I guess I'm maybe
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
asking how do how does that work when it
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the budget if someone put
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
something in the budget for the use of a
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
toll credit so so toll credits isn't
 
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
actual money okay so that just is the
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
match the soft match to get Federal
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
matching money so if there was a project
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
where the FED say it's a you know $100
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
project it's an 8020 match you can use
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
toll credits to match $20 $20 of that
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
100 the state would only get $80 for the
 
00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
project so you still if there's no
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
federal money toll credits don't help
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
you well I got I'm just looking at the
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
last sentence of that law uh 228 col2 it
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
says any other use of toll credit shall
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
require approval of the joint
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislative capital projects overview
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
committee so they come in as an item to
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
this committee and and make a request
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
and and this committee either approves
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
it or denies
 
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.549 align:start position:0%
it or denies
it

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
yeah representative evil okay so I is
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
the is the reason that um the governor
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
has put in her HB to that this report
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
should be prepared annually instead of
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
quarterly because of the work that's
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
involved in preparing it I think the
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
answer is yes um but I would defer to
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
services but it's a pretty pretty
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
combersome report and it requires a
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
couple of their um it's not only their
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
accounting office but Public Works has
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
to step in as well as um some
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
administrative help to well I was just
 
00:24:58.350 --> 00:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
going to suggest maybe one way of red
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
ring the workload if we still did want
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
it quarterly is to make the reporting
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
level 2 million say instead of 1 million
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
or raise the threshold I mean that's up
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
I just thought I would mention it if
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's of Interest so I I think when the
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
change occurred it was a desire of the
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
previous committee to maintain the
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
projects that would show up from the
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
capital budget and then any of the
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
add-ons that don't go through the
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
capital budget um if you I'm not sure
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
how much work you would save by
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
increasing it from a million to two
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
million for those projects that aren't
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
included in the capital budget um it
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
might help do on that last page but
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
they've worked they've worked with um
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
this committee and administrative
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
services to basically um generate it
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
through their system so it's not a ton
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
of work for them to do this you you were
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
able to narrow it down for them and took
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
the workload away when when they met
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
with this Committee in the fall several
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not the change in the statute to
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
capital projects from capital budget
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
it's just an overall concern that's
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
right okay that's
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
right any other questions regarding our
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
lengthy informational meeting
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
here seeing none let's move on to item
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
eight the date of our next meeting Mr
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
Shay you have a recommendation please uh
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
in talking with the chair the the
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
thought of April 14th or that week
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
that's a Monday um and possibly June
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
23rd and the reason those two dates were
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
picked is that um April 14th would be
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
after the house completes its budget
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
process so you should have crossovers
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
all complete as well as the Senate and
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate shouldn't be um too too busy
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
with all the bills that they're getting
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
from the house by that point and then
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
the June 23rd date would be in between
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
Committee of conferences and the last
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
session day so those were the two um
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
if we pick the 23rd I won't be here
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's the legislative Golf Classic
 
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:09.310 align:start position:0%
that's the legislative Golf Classic
day

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative sen I'm sorry
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters yeah just on the 14th uh
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical advisory committee
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
meets at 9: so if we had that day we
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
could meet at 11: or but if I can't be
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
here I can't be here I made toggle
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's the meetings at the this
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
commit I don't make the decision on the
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
meeting it would be up to the chair and
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee correct
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
well I think we could get a substitute
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
as long as you're the only one at this
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
point in time so let's go ahead and
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
schedule the 14th
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
then 14th for sure and
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
correct it's actually not the day after
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
EAS I believe it's the day after pom
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
yes and we'll take up the 20 June 23rd
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
on the 14th we'll see how everybody's
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
anything else if not I'll look for a
 
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
