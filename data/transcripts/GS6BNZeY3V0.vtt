bills that we heard yesterday and see
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
where um what's everybody's thoughts
 
00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
about uh what we heard and we'll start
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
with HB
 
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
1351 prohibiting the sale and use of
 
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
adhesive based rodent traps I make a
 
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion would you uh yes could we
 
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
start with uh the Kangaroos and then go
 
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
to the abuse registry and and then end
 
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the traps sure I think the the Fue
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
traps is going to be the longest
 
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
discussion by far so
 
00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
okay make it so we'll make it so so then
 
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
let's start with uh HB
 
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
1325 relative to allowing private
 
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
ownership of small-tailed monkeys
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
kangaroos um who would like to start off
 
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
the conversation on that uh very
 
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
interesting Bill representative
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
Howard I very much thank you madam chair
 
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
I very much want to start this off
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
because I feel that it was a f it's a
 
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
frivolous Bill and um and I and I'm a
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
little bit um
 
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
disturbed by the the amount of time that
 
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
we put into it um so I I you know I
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
would um I would move to itl or whatever
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
it takes to get rid of this
 
00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
bill well we can't itl today because
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
noticed um but I believe the the first
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we have to itl this
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill we will grab it I'm sure
 
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
bill we will grab it I'm sure
representative

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
Duty I totally Concur and and I really
 
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
really think we need to be talking to
 
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
leadership about triaging some of these
 
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
bills like this um I do like the use of
 
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
the word frivolous because I think that
 
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
really explains what we're dealing with
 
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
here and if we allow the process to take
 
00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 align:start position:0%
over and continue to um give these bills
 
00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
the consideration that we did yesterday
 
00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
I think we're just going to encourage
 
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
encourage them I so I think we need to
 
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
address this at some
 
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
address this at some
level

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
Kenny yes thank you I just think that it
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
leaves so many questions how are people
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
going to get otter and skunks and
 
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
raccoons are they going to go out and
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
try and trap them themselves there's
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
just so many and the vaccines the whole
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
thing there was just so much left
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
unanswered and I I just um
 
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
don't don't like a bill like this when
 
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
it it's not complete and I do think it's
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
frivolous representative um Bixby sorry
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
yeah so um when I asked about whether
 
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
there was a difference between
 
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
a inanimate object and a pet and the
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
answer was no that pretty much sealed it
 
00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 align:start position:0%
from me because we have an entire
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
section of law on animal cruelty that is
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
based on the idea that animals are not
 
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
just property there they are there's
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's more responsibility for to for
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
an animal than there is for uh inanimate
 
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
property and uh and yes animals are
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
property but they are not only property
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and anytime that you acquire a
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
pet you are acquiring a set of
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that is beyond just
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
proper property and uh when if if these
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
if someone decide discovers that they
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
can no longer take care of a kangaroo or
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
a short-tailed monkey does that then go
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
to a shelter and do the shelters have
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
any capacity for dealing with that uh if
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
there is a complaint about uh animal
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
neglect because people aren't taking
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
care of the Kangaroos and their monkeys
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
is what are what is going what are our
 
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
local who he's going to do with
 
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
that representative ktoa thank you I
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
can't keep
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you madam chair we won't
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
talk we won't talk anymore about the
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
joies um but anyways
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
um the bigger question for me was it was
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to they were going to be companion
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
animals um and that
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
just is an area of law that these
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
animals should not be part
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
of um and I think just having it in that
 
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.070 align:start position:0%
of um and I think just having it in that
section

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
questionable I concur with everything
 
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's been said that you know one of
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
the things too is that you know if if
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to have such a a deep
 
00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
desire to have monkeys or raccoons or
 
00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
foxes I mean if they want to open up um
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
they can still own them here in New
 
00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you can get a special
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
certificate if you want to open up a zoo
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
or you want to have a a private zoo or
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a um an uh Wildlife
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
Education Center or something like that
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason why you couldn't
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
but I know we're going to be hearing
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
another kangaroo Bill having to do with
 
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
kangaroo Farm farming kangaroo uh
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
Slaughter that kind of thing so um in
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
that sense I guess when we get to that
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
bill we're also going to have to look at
 
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
the issue of owning a kangaroo in New
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but I guess that's going to
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
be for that bill when we hear that um
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
but for me yeah I the more people that I
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
talked to about um these particular this
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
particular list of animals and even if
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
we crossed some animals off and said
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
some were good and some were not good um
 
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
I just feel
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
like um these are these are really
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
animals that are not meant to be
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
domesticated they C they probably cannot
 
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.029 align:start position:0%
domesticated they C they probably cannot
be

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
domesticated um they are they present
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
problems for the owners for um family
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
members that may be around them um I've
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
heard some horrendous stories about uh
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
people in other states who have owned
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
monkeys who have been um disfigured from
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
them they are not the these just these
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
are not animals that are meant to be in
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
homes uh
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
and it's also not in talking to some
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarians it's also not to the
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
animals benefit to be kept in a home
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
environment um because it's not their
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
natural habitat they can't Thrive and
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
and grow well um in that in that sense
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
so for me this is an absolute itl for
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
this bill but any other comments my
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
represent comment is that I agree and I
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't think we should spend any more
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
time on it yes let's move
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
on hp55 establishing an animal abuse
 
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.310 align:start position:0%
on hp55 establishing an animal abuse
offender

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
offender
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
registry uh any
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
comments or concerns about that
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.310 align:start position:0%
comments or concerns about that
representative

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
Duty um I I think this bill should be
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
ited because I don't from our
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
questioning I don't think that it meets
 
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
the intent of what the sponsor wanted
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
but at the same time I really think the
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee needs to be looking at
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
tightening or how we go about um
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
supporting our Animal Control Officers
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh with some of these abuse
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
um complaints that that they see I mean
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
we've seen this over and over again
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
where shelter employees um Animal
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
Control Officers uh people that work at
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture are really
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
traumatized by what they see out there
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they don't feel that
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or the Judiciary System
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
can back them up so I think at some
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
point we need to look at that and maybe
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
we think about something like an animal
 
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.949 align:start position:0%
we think about something like an animal
Court

00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
so that you have a judge that's trained
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
in these kinds of
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
things yeah represent
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
kto thank you madam chair um I agree
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
with you that what the you know the bill
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
is trying to do does not meet that
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
although last year or I think it was
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
last year representative Bixby could
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
correct me um I introduced a bill to may
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
have an ACO as part of the sheriff's
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
department in each County
 
00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
um and they would be responsible for
 
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
knowing any that goes on in each County
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
which I think would meet would have met
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here um that was
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
met with a lot of resistance from acos
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
themselves and the police um because
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
they felt like they're they would be
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
overstepped um that was not the intent
 
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
um but because the sheriff has a a
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
greater deal of uh law enforcement where
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
they can issue warrants immediately and
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
do things it would have helped um solve
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
some um get animals that are being
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
abused out of those uh areas almost
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
immediately um so um I think that
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
something on a regional basis is is how
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
we would need to look at this
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so um I think
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
that um um I I agree with Barbara I
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
think that the the her bill from last
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
time last time it wasn't wasn't quite in
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
wasn't quite ready for prime time um and
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that you know I was a co-sponsor on it
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
so I bear some of the responsibility
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
there too but but uh one of the things
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
that I think is important with that is
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
that this is not the purview of our
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee this is a criminal justice
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
issue and if we want to move in that
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
direction we need to coordinate with
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
criminal justice uh uh and I think that
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of this the bill we've heard
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
here I think there are all sorts of dup
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
process implications that we don't have
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
the expertise to assess and but they
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
they concern me uh and I I think that
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess our our friends from CSG
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
are not here at the moment but they were
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
in on the discussion a number of years
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
ago about a very similar Bill and
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh we came to the conclusion at that
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
point that it was inexpedient to
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
legislate and I don't see anything in
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
this bill that has improved
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I concur with uh all that's been
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
um you know aside from the the you know
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
making lists and that people can become
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
Target if targets if they're on the list
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
and and all of
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
that I do think that you know the
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
um a good point was brought up in that
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some better
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
communication within law enforcement as
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
to who's been arrested for what or who's
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
been indicted for what or who's been
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
charged or uh convicted of for what
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
crimes so that there's you know
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
some um some knowledge of what they may
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
need to have um an awareness of um so I
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
I like you your idea um
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh I I do believe uh absolutely
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is more of a criminal
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
justice and and law enforcement
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
communication issue than it is for you
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
know us to say we should have some sort
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
of registry of people representative
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
Murray and then uh comto thank you madam
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
chair I also think that there might be
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
other questions with regard to the
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
judicial process and Judiciary so I did
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that to representative
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
bixby's point that whether it's criminal
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
justice or Judiciary that those facets
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
are far beyond sort of our scope and
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
outside of that and I I you know in in
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
the investigative process or whatever
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
due process things are happening in the
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
scope of an investigation I think that
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
those are also things that would need to
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
be considered different you know okay
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
represent com thank you and just because
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
you brought up you know the stalking and
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
the internet stuff
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
the idea behind a county um places they
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
would keep the records it would be held
 
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
in confidence but law enforcement would
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
have access to it not the general public
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
important all right
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
then um so I think we're pretty um
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
pretty United in the thought that this
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um would be an
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
itl all right um moving along to uh the
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
last that we heard yesterday of uh HB
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
1351 prohibiting the sale and use of
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
adhesive based rodent traps who would
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
like to start the conversation on that
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
chair um I I was uh I mean I I think
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
that the the issue of Cruelty is should
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
not go unrecognized or un un but um I
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
also just like the last time we talked
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
about when we talked about the Andy
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
coagulate um the professional it was
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
very persuasive the young man who who
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
does it for a living and and in the
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
hands of professionals I I don't think
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
that the cruelty goes away but but it we
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
recognize the um the need for it
 
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.509 align:start position:0%
recognize the um the need for it
more

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
Yep anyone else I I have reached out to
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farm Bureau to ask that
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
they weigh in on this um bill as well
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm waiting to hear back from um Rob
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
Johnson but uh just in initial
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
conversation prior to our meeting this
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
morning um he said that um you know
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are some Farmers that do make use
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
of uh of the glue traps
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and that you know it's another tool
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
to be used um a lot of
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
these uh tools that we use to control or
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate the rodent population they're
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
they're not um they're not wonderful
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
tools for the rodent but it's designed
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
not to be uh um a good thing for the
 
00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:09.799 align:start position:0%
rodents because we want to get rid of
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
them for a number of different reasons
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
in any case representative comto thank
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
and I I do have I brought in a couple
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
different samples um and I can pass them
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
around this one here it talks about
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
please to mainly euthanize the mouse
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
before disposing of the Trap and it says
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
do not Place trap where birds or
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
non-target animals may come into contact
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's very specific on here and the thing
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
is is most in agriculture I would say
 
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.789 align:start position:0%
is is most in agriculture I would say
that

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
um we they're used like in the barns uh
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
individuals use them in their homes but
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
they use them instead of bait because
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
they're afraid that their other animals
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
if they got into them would ingest the
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
poison um and so although this may not
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
be I don't I I don't know if there's any
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
humane way of really killing anything um
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
just going to throw that out there um
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
but these are a health
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
hazard um in agriculture and in our
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
homes um what are the the mice are
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
health hazard or the glue traps the the
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
rodents okay well the rodents are the
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
health hazard um because you know their
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
feces are a problem um they're very
 
00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:49.230 align:start position:0%
feces are a problem um they're very
destructive

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
destructive
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
um and they multiply
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
rapidly um so there's this one here like
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
I said and it talk about uh how to
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
humanely dispose of it I mean it doesn't
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
tell you how to do it it just asks that
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
you do it humanely and it does say do
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
not come in contact with other things um
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
this one here is uh for rat mouse and
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
snake um I would never use it for a
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
snake because um snakes eat mice snakes
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
eat mice so and uh I don't have any
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
snakes in my house to the best of I my
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
ability but tells you where to put them
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
it says on floors under sinks and along
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
baseboards doesn't say to use outside in
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
the garden or anything like that because
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
as we heard from the professional who
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
testified yesterday if they get dust or
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
dirt on them if they're out for two or
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
three days the adhesive no longer works
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
so they're useless so I think when we're
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
talking the person was talking about
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
gardening and things like that it's like
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
in either potting shed or a barn or even
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
in your home but you have to give people
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
some tools to utilize I mean there's all
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
kinds of tools but even catching
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
something in a trap if you don't catch
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
it is going to Res you know is not going
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
to be Humane right because if you don't
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
check your trap all the time the M could
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
die in the Trap so
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a necessary
 
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a necessary
unfortunately

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh these should not be banned in my
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
opinion because as they said they are
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
intelligent and once they get wind of
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
how you're trying to um control the
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
population they think they come up with
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
rodents and then we have to come up with
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
another solution to try and uh control
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
that population as far as I understood
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
too I mean there are a lot of people who
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
just for ethical reasons or whatever
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
their reasons will not buy these anyway
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
and I think you know there's a lot of
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
public education going on too as to what
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate means to trap or
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
control rodents and people can decide
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
for themselves I I think um rather than
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
Banning them um there are there are
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
definitely uh ways to educate people to
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
say what what's a good way what's not a
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
good way what works for you in terms of
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
what you can use to to um trap or
 
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.470 align:start position:0%
what you can use to to um trap or
control

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
roadin and um I think you know instead
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
of banning it let the market decide
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
there are going to be stores that won't
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
sell them and they are going to be uh
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
people who won't buy them so represent
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
Duty thank
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
you uh in my opinion Banning something
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
like this forces into industry um to um
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
make changes and to come up with
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
innovative ways um to tackle the problem
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
and I would say you know the world
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
didn't cave in when we banned
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
DDT but we did it for a reason because
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
we knew that that pesticide was very
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
very harmful I believe it was to Bald
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
Eagles or whatever so I would be in
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill um I think there are
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
other options uh we killed rodents 20 30
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
40 100 years ago when we didn't have
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
glue traps and people still existed um
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
and I again I think it forces the
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
industry to come up with uh better more
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
Humane um ways of solving a
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
problem thank you representative duty
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
but you know I would also submit that um
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
because there are many people who won't
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
purchase the and stores that won't sell
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
them that the industry is indeed still
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
looking for a better mouse trap and they
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
are coming up
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
with better and in more Innovative means
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
to control um the rodent population as
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
well so I don't know
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
that that banning them would would or
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
not Banning them would dissuade these
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
companies from coming up with other
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
different mechanisms to do this so just
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
my two cents representative Howard um I
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
think that uh if with education there
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
would you know if people there if people
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
who are worried about the suffering of
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
rodents um learn that that that this is
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
a not the the fastest way for a mouse to
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
die um they're not going to buy them I
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
think that I think that if we if there's
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
information about what exactly happens
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
with these traps there will be self-
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
selecting segment of society that just
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
won't buy them and um and I and I sort
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
of agree with you madam chair that that
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
it sort of it should be left to that I
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
think thank you representative K thank
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
you and like I said it does say here on
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
this most may still be alive when trap
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
is checked please
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
humanely uh euthanize before disposing
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
of but personally because in agriculture
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
i h have ultrasonic I use peppermint oil
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
it's not a I think these have been in my
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
closet for I don't know how many years
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
um but anyways but I need all the tools
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
available at my
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
disposal BEC and because I have dogs I'm
 
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.310 align:start position:0%
disposal BEC and because I have dogs I'm
very

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
cognizant of and when I had other
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
animals I was very cognizant because um
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
need to be sure of what I'm using is not
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
going to be talking toic to any of those
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
also so these are non-toxic to other
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
animals also um I'm just going to throw
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
that out there but yes there are a lot
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
ultrasonic the the
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
traps um but the rodent population up in
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
my area and I used to go to a greenhouse
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
and I was talking with a farmer you know
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
he very large supplied uh vegetables and
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
flowers to a lot of people and I was in
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse and I'm like I there was
 
00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse and I'm like I there was
a

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
rat and I said what's going on he goes
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
we never had rats this
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
population is heading north and is on
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
the rise and it is a public health uh
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
issue the so I just want everyone to
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
understand that they are a public health
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
issue also represent has
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I don't think I
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
have a compelling
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
argument against what appears to be the
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
majority I just think it's a bad look I
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
think you know somebody wants us to ban
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
inhumane and we have all the
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
intellectual arguments about why we
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do it and I'm struggling to
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
get there um although I can't refute any
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the perfectly reasonable arguments I
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't know how you um exterminate them
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
humanly I mean that's the conundrum from
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
the beginning yeah I I just I think it's
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
a bad look it it just doesn't set well
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
with me call me a softy you
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm struggling with it I I a tool
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the tool boox well let's get better
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
tools you know let is science not
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
Advanced enough to give us something
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
better than this I'm
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
struggling thank you representative
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
Kenny yes thank you um commissioner
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
Jasper made a really good suggestion
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday he said if you have pets
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
around and you're afraid that inside
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
using those glue things um boards to put
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
it in a box and cut a hole so that the
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
mouse can get in but nothing else can
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
get in so I
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
the traps that are set with bait have a
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
small hole so only the mice can get in
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
and nothing else so if the if the
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
packaging said made that
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion you you make you know you put
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
it inside a box I mean it's still I
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
think that the glue I would rather have
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
had the service that came in to our
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
house and put the bait traps down had
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
used the glue ones our house stunk with
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
we have an old part of the house the
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
mice died in the walls and it was months
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's months and it still smells so I
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
would rather have had the glue traps and
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
been able to empty them myself and I've
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
because I have chickens and I've had
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
rats and because I've had vs in the
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
garden um I I know how to you know
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
humanely and for for what the
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
destruction that rodents can do um sorry
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
but it I I know it's awful to put an
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
animal down and I don't like to do it
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
but you have to it's it's
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
farming that's my
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
opinion represent Howard um I don't know
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
how long mice live like what is the what
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
is the lifespan of a mouse because and
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
and Mixie of course know
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh most lifetime is ballpark one to two
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
years oh unless they're snatched up by a
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
hawk or a snake or something
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
right and in the and in that time how
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
many how many reproductive Cycles do
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
they have just out of
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
curiosity every 21 days and it's usually
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
what like five to six mice per every 21
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
days your
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.830 align:start position:0%
days your
additional

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
all right I'm I think we're we're pretty
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
much uh done hashing that around and I
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
know um we are not supposed to uh be
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
hearing another bill until what do we
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
got here 11 o' so I guess I uh
 
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.909 align:start position:0%
got here 11 o' so I guess I uh
miscalculated

00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
miscalculated
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately so we have a half
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
hour um and uh I'll just invite you all

bill along with an a proposed
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
amendment so um you have the floor thank
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
you very much uh my name is uh for the
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mark McKenzie I am uh
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
State Rep from District 40 which is five
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
ws in the city of
 
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh this bill
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
1316 uh uh I'm I can offer the amendment
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
now if you'd like all of you I think
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
with the exception may I think everybody
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
should have a copy in front front of
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
them uh but the amendment is important
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it uh it is in
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
response to some questions that I have
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
relative to uh how people get access to
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
information so I can take that either we
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
can talk about that now or we can talk
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
about that um what would your preference
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
be um well I'd like you to talk about um
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
the bill and what problem you're seeking
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
to solve and
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
how your Amendment will do that all
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you this is a uh a problem
 
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
that has been ongoing uh in Manchester
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh for some
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
time and what's going on is uh there are
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh kennels opening up Dog Daycare
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
operations that are opening up in the
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
city and the uh on two occasions uh the
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
the the the city turned down the kennel
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
permit because it wasn't appropriate for
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
the zoning area and uh what's going on
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
is that people have um using
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
co-ownership as a foil uh against the
 
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances so they basically uh
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
and I got a case that we uh that went to
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
district court so what what happens is
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
that uh the city moved on on this person
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
let me for the record say um this is my
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
neighbor and I I get along with them
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
great they're terrific people I really
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
like them but they opened up uh after
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
the after they were denied uh the the
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
kennel permit uh at a hearing at which
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
had the whole neighborhood show it up to
 
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh they decided to move forward uh and
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
open up the this operation anyways and
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
what they did is they basically said
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
when the city moved on them and they
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
went to court they claimed that they
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
were the the co-owners of the animals
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
now I looked at um and I work with AO uh
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislative services to try to find some
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
definition of what co-ownership would
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
mean and there's very little on in New
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are actually uh uh around the
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
country there's very little uh
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
information about that but we know the
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
the the case next to me and then there
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
was another case uh recently that came
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
up where uh this person was one wanted
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing and they declare
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
co-ownership again so when you declare
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
co-ownership and you say you own it in
 
01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester you can have as many animals
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
on the property as you want if you own
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
them now there's restrictions in terms
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
of noise and all those other kinds of
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions that you have but basically
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
you can do pretty much what you want and
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
so so we're we're in this situation
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
where uh when you ask somebody so what
 
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
does it mean to be a co-owner does it
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
mean you simply sign a piece of paper
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
and you you say well I own the dog or do
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
you uh have to take some responsibility
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
for the ownership of that animal which
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
is what this legislation basically says
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
now the piece that I took out with the
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
which the amendment responds to is there
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
was a number of years ago there was a
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
state senator from Bedford who passed
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the uh legislation which limited access
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the registration records of animals
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
and in talking to people who are who
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
come from the business uh and I've had a
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
few terrific people who've been
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
counseling me on this is that uh you
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
really don't want to lift that
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
restriction uh you don't want to have
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
access everybody have access to that
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
information uh there are there are and
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
you may hear from some other people but
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
there there's a good reason for that um
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
there were there was animal rights
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
organizations and other people who use
 
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:48.950 align:start position:0%
organizations and other people who use
that

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
information uh and so I I thought the
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
cleanest thing to do was just simply to
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
take take it out now what happens in um
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
what happens without that what happens
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
currently is that the people who can get
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
access to that information are not the
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
neighbors they're not the people who
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
live in the neighborhood they are they
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
are people who have the enforcement
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
Authority so police officers can get it
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
inspectors can get it other people can
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
get that that
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
information I'm sorry okay uh but the
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
general public can't get it so you're in
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
a situation where um you've got all
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
these dogs showing up next door or in
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
another part of the city and you don't
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
know who who owns the things the city
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
inspectors go there they say they co-own
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
it and so it's caused somewhat of a u a
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
dilemma for the enforcement Authority
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
within the community and so all this
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
thing says and and there may be some
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
other reasons why we want to do this
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill essentially says that if
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
you claim it you there is responsibility
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh connected with that
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
claim uh and that means that you take
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
some responsibility not just simply sign
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper and walk away but if
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
you want to assume co-ownership then
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
that comes with certain conditions and
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
what the legislation basically says you
 
01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
got to demonstrate that in fact uh you
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
take care of them in some way that you
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
you work with the you know you help with
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
the with the the providing food or
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
shelter or um or work with them with the
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
vet or takes takes other responsibility
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
which is what normal owners would do um
 
01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
but they but that's not what they want
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
they simply want to sign the piece of
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
paper and walk away now the courts uh uh
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
after a law was passed here the courts
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
have given um standing to animals in
 
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
divorce cases uh so it is it's actually
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
looked at the terminology is uh but it's
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually part of the divorce set so
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
you can have that co-ownership
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
environment um so I think what this what
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
this does is to basically say okay
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's you're going to do it there are
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
certain conditions need to be met now
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
all of those conditions may need to be
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
in the rules as opposed to being uh in
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
the law but it does basically say you
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
can't do that unless you really are
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
co-owning that animal so that
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
essentially you know that that's what
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
this is uh there are a number of these
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
things popping up all over the place if
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
you to do quick Google search you find
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
daycare uh Doggy Daycare operations uh
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
around Manchester and and around other
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
communities um so this is this is
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
popping up it's a pretty profitable
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
business it's 50 probably average $50 a
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
day um and there's not a whole lot not a
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
l whole lot of restrictions on it uh so
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
I think that what we're trying to do um
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
in Manchester the only board is kind of
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
in a dilemma about this but what I'm
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do and I've been I've told him
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
about this the chair of the Zone board
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I have been in conversation and uh
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
they think this would be helpful um
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
because they I think they're somewhat
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
frustrated over over this how this is
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
being in worked so that's um that's
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
essentially what it does um now you
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
could say it's a narrow uh Manchester
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
Bill uh but I would suggest that uh
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
given the court uh decisions and
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed here that really
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
is broader than that that there needs to
 
01:12:28.629 --> 01:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
be something that really defines what
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
that term means co-ownership
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay um so let me get this
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
straight you're claiming that people are
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
using the the the premise of
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
co-ownership in order to establish a
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
Doggy Daycare Center in their
 
01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:51.510 align:start position:0%
Doggy Daycare Center in their
community

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
in statute there's no way to
 
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.270 align:start position:0%
in statute there's no way to
prove

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
prove
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise that that's that's my
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
understanding and legislative Services
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
looked at this and they said we can't
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
really find anything they looked around
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire looked around we have no
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
um current definition of Doggy Daycare
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
operations and current statute is that
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
is that that's probably correct
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
question so if I'm understanding this
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
correctly am I understanding that these
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
and these folks are establishing a
 
01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
proprietorship of some type a business
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
of entity of some type are they then
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
also applying for co-ownership of the
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
business entity as they're establishing
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
it or I'm having a hard time
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
understanding when when
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
somebody goes into a business venture
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
right like that and
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
then based on your testimony
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
I'm am I inferring correctly that the
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
statement you're making is that there
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
are multiple dogs that are being claimed
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
as co-ownership and therefore
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
they are not establishing an actual
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
legal entity of a business or I I'm
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
trying to understand sure there were
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
well there were two cases that um that
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
have got some attention this is the the
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
one in uh again my next door a neighbor
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
good guy um they basically were denied I
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's any business
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
actual business in the sense that
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
they've established themselves they've
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
registered the business and all those
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of I don't know um but they
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
clearly are I see the cards every day
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
popping in there uh the other one was
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
one off of um and I and I have the
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
information um but it was off of Melrose
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
Street this woman wanted to open it up
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
she went to the zoning board the zoning
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
board was very nervous about it about
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
granting any kind of of variance for
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
this particular uh operation the reason
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
being is that the variance goes with the
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
property so while you may represent that
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
you're going I'm just going to have
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
little dogs when you sell a house and
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
you got a variance for a daycare it's
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
Dog Daycare you even have very big dogs
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
which was the case when they originally
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
started the one next door to me um they
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
were jumping over the
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
fence uh so yeah so that's uh I don't
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know I don't
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
know repres of Howard um I have thank
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I have experience with
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
the um people making claims about dogs
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
in as being um support dogs and there's
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
there's actually no proof required
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's no um so I know that it that
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
these relationships can be sort of um
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
nebulous um so do you think that this
 
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
definition is is I mean how would you
 
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
deploy this
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
definition to to clarify things well I
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
mean I haven't I I haven't tried to
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
address that in this legislation but if
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that you think needs to
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
be amended and use this as a vehicle to
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
do that I'd be open to that what I find
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
is there were a couple of um issues that
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
come up with with this there were
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
breeders um there are breeders and I
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
don't maybe some in the room now um that
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
have this relationship during various
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
times of the dog's life they may be they
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
may be breeding the dogs or or taking
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
care of them following the birth of dogs
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
and people would know much more about
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
this and I do um so there's one there's
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
one issue um the other issue that we're
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
running into is that people using um
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
they they're saying they're not really
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
really we're not really taking care of
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
them but they're just friends these are
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
doggy friends but you're getting paid to
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
take care of the friends uh uh and if
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's the case that goes from being you
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
know you're running a business and
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're using the animals and so it's a
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
mess it really is kind of a me and
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
inspectors I was an inspector in
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester fire for years
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a this kind of squishy you
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
know how you get at this is uh is
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
difficult but I think before we get this
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
proliferation of uh daycare sentence I
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important to try to give some
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
direction to the community about
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
this before you um
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
so so are you looking more for some way
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
in which municipalities can
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
control um the operation of a Doggy
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
Daycare Center in their town I I'm
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
looking for um for a definition so that
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
that that we Define what co-ownership
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
means that's what I'm looking for in
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation whether it be in
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester Goan or some other community
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
because it should have some standing
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
representative Duty thank you Madam
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
so if I have an analogy of like a
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
daycare center for children y okay so I
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
go to the zoning board and I say I want
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
to open a daycare center and they say no
 
01:18:10.629 --> 01:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
you can't it's not zoned for that so I
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
bring in five children and I say they're
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
all my nieces and nephews um so and I'm
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
just taking care of them for my you know
 
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
relatives that's basically what's
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
happening and and so that's how they're
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
getting along get getting around and as
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
long as they don't care about liability
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
they don't register a business you know
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
and they just collect the payments yeah
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
okay so okay thank
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that I think it's
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
good so um one of the things that
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I that I'm a little bit puzzled about
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
with the bill is that uh it doesn't
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually create a definition of
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
co-ownership and co-ownership of dogs is
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned in one place in the
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
statutes which is in the animal cruelty
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
statutes where uh if someone is being
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
tried for animal cruelty and there is
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
evidence of co-ownership
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh then that then that co-owner would if
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
the animal has to be removed from the
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
place where the cruelty is happening the
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
co-owner would be first on the list to
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
um to to be able to uh take the dog on
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
as long as that was approved by the
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
judge who's hearing the case uh so it
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be like okay well the husband
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
is being charged so the wife is a
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
co-owner and therefore you know it would
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
stay in the same situation that would be
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
something that a judge would say that
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
won't work but if it's say a u a dog
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
that is being bred for show and uh there
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
are and one person is sort of has C
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
typically has custody and another person
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
is the one who takes it to shows or
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
whatever uh then uh that would be a
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
situation where that that second person
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
who's not on the same premises would be
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
able to uh to have priority in terms of
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
taking the care taking care of the
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
animal after um a a charge of animal
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
abuse uh that's the current the only
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
place that co-ownership exists in
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
statute right now um what you're
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
proposing here doesn't actually create a
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
diff a definition of it and I'm not sure
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
that so I'm not sure that this is
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
um create enough standing to do what you
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
do can I respond to that sure absolutely
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so I went through with
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislative services and I said let's
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
nail this thing down and they were very
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
nice and they researched it all all
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
around the country and and they said you
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
know the best thing you can probably do
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
is make this as simple as possible go
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
into the Committee hearing and take
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
input from people in the Committee
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and perhaps offer um an
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
amendment so that's that's why this is
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
not real doesn't have a lot of Bones to
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
it now some of this stuff as as we know
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff we pass here and the
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
rules take over they you know they come
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
up with certain rules whether or not
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
this provides enough direction to to
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
wherever this lands for for addition
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
rules I and I'm also willing to amend
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
this thing um but I don't think we
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
should just I I think there should be
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
some uh reasonable way to
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
determine um who owns this animal and
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the responsibility is that's what
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do here and and look I'm
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
way out of my wheelhouse here I I come
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
from the labor committee uh I've never
 
01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
dealt with this uh these kinds of issues
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
um but I did try as best I could and
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
there's a file right here of all the
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
back and forth see the let us say
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
Services myself representative Murray
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just sort of
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about based on representative
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
bixby's comments and and your testimony
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this is really an
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
issue about self attestation of
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
co-ownership or if there is a legal
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
claim to co-ownership in some other way
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
through an official record or a
 
01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.430 align:start position:0%
through an official record or a
documentation

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
through uh you know whether it is uh an
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
animal like Club registration where
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
co-owners are listed on an official
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
document somewhere or that type of thing
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
is that the desire that you're trying to
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
see is something more official than a
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
self attestation to say yes oh like
 
01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.950 align:start position:0%
self attestation to say yes oh like
we're

01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
co-owners yeah I mean you know I I think
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
that there's been some testimony some
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
questions and some uh
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
input but you know I think it's easy to
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
understand co-ownership if you co-own a
 
01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
house or you co-own a car or you co-own
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
some other asset uh that you know if
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
you're putting that down you got to
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
claim some responsibility for that and
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to Define here so
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
when you make that when you do that it's
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
has some standing now for the city's
 
01:23:07.470 --> 01:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
perspective um they need to know this
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be used this kind just
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
signing a piece of paper and saying well
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
I own the dog now and and just bypass
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
his owning audiances which is what's
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
happening that shouldn't be the
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
case represent Bixby so I'm also
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
wondering whether uh the people who are
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
the the real owners of the dogs uh if
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
they are saying if they sign a paper
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
saying you know it's co-owned are they
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
putting themselves in
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy uh for having the animal
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
essentially taken away from
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
them uh through some sort of a
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
scam you know I think that that's an
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
interesting um you know question and the
 
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh there was legislation passed here and
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
I have it somewhere but there was
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislation which basically gave animals
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
standing and divorce um so they become
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
part of the divorce settlement so what
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
does this mean if two people own this
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
animal um all of a sudden they're in
 
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.189 align:start position:0%
animal um all of a sudden they're in
this

01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
mix and I don't know how they straighten
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
that out quite
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
frankly well I I did get a um some
 
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
um input from uh legal who said that
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
within the family law context RSA 458
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
col6a property settlement and divorce
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
proceedings was amended in 2019 to
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
include the following provision
 
01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.109 align:start position:0%
include the following provision
regarding

01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
animals um Roman numeral 2- a tangible
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
property shall include
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
animals in such cases the property
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
settlement shall address the care and
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
ownership of the party's animals taking
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
into consideration the animals
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
well-being upon Petition of either party
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
the court May review and modify the
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
property settlement agreed to previously
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
own to previously only as it pertains to
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
this paragraph So I mean that's really
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
the only definition of co-ownership that
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
I know of I don't know that 458 col 16-
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and it seems to be explicitly
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
circumscribed exactly and the courts
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.550 align:start position:0%
pretty much
determine

01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
that the court considers it represented
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
Howard first I'd like to clarify that I
 
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't suggesting that you add um
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
service dogs to your definition or
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's using any more
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
as an example so um sorry for that
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
confusion um but I also think that with
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
absent of context that this um it feels
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit like this definition of
 
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
ownership or co-ownership is flapping in
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
the wind a little bit like you know is
 
01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't feel very useful without any
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill um is there any other way that the
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
municipality can um
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
control the U having a business I mean
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
they can they explicitly say in their
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
um a Doggy Daycare cannot be established
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
in a specific specific area something
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
well if I could do I mean does does your
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
town already have that ordinance in
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
place yes well they they basically have
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
zoning audiances or they're what they're
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
allowable things in different zones of
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
the city this is not allowable in the
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
city that's why the people have had to
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
apply for zoning variants to try to
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
operate these things and um and again it
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
turns on what it means to be the coona
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
and that's how they that's the foil
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
they've used okay represent Duty
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry representative H Haskins
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if somebody
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
agregates what the town or municipality
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
has said why can't they charge them in
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
some way you know the the variance was
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
denied here's a case right here uhhuh
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
and the case this case was the the
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
inspectors proceeded against them as
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
they should they did all the research
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
they pulled out all the records they got
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
to Superior they got to district court
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
on the step of District Court the these
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
people who who were um in violation
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
according to the city pulled out the
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
co-ownership slip and say we own these
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
dogs doesn't seem like that's a legal
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
document you know you're writing a you
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
can write anything and sign your name to
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
it but they're on the registration form
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
from what I
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
understand that's this is what's this is
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
what's happening I think it's crazy too
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
but that's what's happening represent Dy
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um is it
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
possible in in a situation where if you
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
have a form for co-ownership that it's
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
um signed by both the owners of the
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
Doggy Daycare the owners of the dog and
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
it's notorized I mean because under
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
notarization don't they have to swear
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
under penalty of law and wouldn't a
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
notary have to you have to show proof to
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
the notary that what you're signing is
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
correct would could that kind of help
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
the situation um if I could sure um I I
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
think that I think that would change the
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
dynamic I think if people had to put
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
their name and notorized their name and
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
but at the same time if it doesn't mean
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
anything if co-ownership is not defined
 
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
is what your responsibility is then I
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
think it's it doesn't have a lot of
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
Bones you um you know so I think that's
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
that's really what the core of this
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
thing is but no I in fact I have some um
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
some information in some places where
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
they actually do that they say this is
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
what this is say kind of the checklist
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
that they have but it's very rare around
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
the country that this this takes place
 
01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
the country that this this takes place
representative

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
Kenny yes thank you um do they require
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
Health certificates for any of these uh
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
places because if they did that if they
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
started requiring health certificate
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
they they would have to claim ownership
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
and it would be signed by a
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and I believe there might
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
be on the bottom I tried to look it up
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
but I can't remember whether there might
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
have been a place for co-ownership but
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
you would have the owner of the dog
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
because I think they do use that in
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
breeders do you remember that Lisa I
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you remember that but
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
anyway I don't know if they if they
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
required health
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
certificates to go into that
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
daycare um then they'd have the names
 
01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:48.430 align:start position:0%
daycare um then they'd have the names
that's

01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
my representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
one other question that I had was around
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
um the total amount of animals or dogs
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here are we
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
talking three animals that are
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
potentially you know all co-owned
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
together or are we talking 30 animals
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
that are being claims of co-ownership
 
01:30:14.590 --> 01:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about here in school
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
sure I mean my understanding is that if
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
you own the dog you can have as many
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
dogs on your property as you want
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
provided they don't violate the
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance of newes or or some of the you
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
know health issues and things like that
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
so you really have no control once that
 
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
you cross that line
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I don't know where the
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
limitation is in that case for the
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
have representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair so I don't know very much
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
about this um does a breeder have to
 
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.390 align:start position:0%
about this um does a breeder have to
have

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.310 align:start position:0%
have
uh

01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
certificates uh
 
01:30:58.350 --> 01:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
licenses yeah I mean I think some there
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
may be some people here that are bers
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
that can answer answer that particular
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
question so we wouldn't be leaving them
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
off the page and getting them involved
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
in this co-ownership thing yeah I mean
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
I'm happy uh I'm happy to um work with
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
them um if if there's some conditions
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
that they have that they need some
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
relief from this proposal and I think we
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
could work with them may I follow up
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
sure so if my son takes his dog to a
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
neighbor I
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
believe and she has uh what looks like a
 
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
business to me you know she's got a Fen
 
01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:39.790 align:start position:0%
business to me you know she's got a Fen
in

01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
backyard um she takes more than his
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
dog um they happen to live in Denver so
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
depending on what the city's ordinance
 
01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.510 align:start position:0%
depending on what the city's ordinance
says

01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
she either is or isn't registered as a
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
business and so I think we haven't
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
nailed down how to define co-ownership
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
yet um but it seems as though the
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
different localities might have
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
different zoning ordinances that might
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
cover this and I think you're saying
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't Manchester doesn't if I
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
could M sure
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
uh I uh legislative Services looked all
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
over the place and they couldn't find
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
any evidence of of how this is properly
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
defined um and that's why you know and I
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
think the court may offer some
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
instruction or or for us in terms of uh
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
what it what this means um so we might
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
be able to work on that but no I
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
don't I I I think the way it is now if
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
you say you're co-owning you can have as
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
many as you want now I don't know the
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
business thing is a whole another thing
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
if you're taking money where's the money
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
going that's a whole another issue but
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
you can't go to the zoning board get
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
denied at the zoning board and then turn
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
around and open it anyways which is
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what's happening represent
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah I'm just thinking that we do
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
have someone in uh who is uh in the
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
audience here who is
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh knowledgeable about the way that uh
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
breeders and uh kennels kennels manage
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
animals and I think maybe uh maybe we
 
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
could have her come up and help us
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
out all right well thank you for
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill um and I guess we
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
Holmes yeah you we'll have Angela
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:34:00.149 align:start position:0%
Holmes yeah you we'll have Angela
too

01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.159 --> 01:34:07.950 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
you make you take
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
your so as I understand the um the
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh bill would with any Amendment
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
not create any kind of publicly
 
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
available list showing co-ownership
 
01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.189 align:start position:0%
available list showing co-ownership
um

01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
and all they're looking all he's looking
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
for really is to have some sort
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
of um definition or statement regarding
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
so I'll tell you the term co-ownership
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my name's Nancy Holmes for the
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
record and I'm here from New Boston and
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
yes I've been a breeder as was president
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
of a dog Club um I know a lot about how
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
things work I don't know everything uh
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
although I try uh anyway the the term
 
01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
co-ownership in the purebred dog world
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
is a contract between two people to own
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
a dog together and this may mean say
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
you've got beautiful show dog that could
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
win everything in the world if only you
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
had a box of money and I come along and
 
01:35:26.430 --> 01:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
say I have a box of money I'd be happy
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
to fund that but I want my name on that
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
dog while we're showing it so that
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
everybody could see that I have the
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful dog um another reason for
 
01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
co-ownership would be for breeding
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
purposes you know I'm willing to help
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
you out doing a litter but I want my
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
name on the litter too so we will change
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
the registration of the dog to reflect
 
01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
two people own it and that's the same
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
with if you're doing the show
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
co-ownership it's the same deal you
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
change the registration of the dog with
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
AKC to show that two people or more I've
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
seen up to five in some really top dogs
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so so that's that's what it is in the
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
pure bread world now um I'm not sure
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
that this Doggy Daycare is is handling
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
pure breads only um or AKC pure breads I
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
know that's how it works for them I am
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
concerned that somebody would be
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
claiming co-ownership of a dog and not
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
be able to provide proof that they have
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
licens the dog which also provides proof
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
that the dog has had rabies vaccination
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
because you can't get a dog license
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
unless the dog has had a rabies
 
01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination um I think if the person is
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
claiming the dog is a co-owner and the
 
01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
dog resides with them they should be
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
able to provide proof of those two
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
things the RAB certificate and the dog
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
license in their name or in both
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
person's name it wouldn't just be
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
um okay so I've got I've got a dog and
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
you're claiming it we co-own it it
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be just my name on the license
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be just my name on the Raby
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
certificate because we co-own the dog
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
that often means we share expenses when
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
something is co-owned um so out in the
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
world where there's um everything in the
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
world is possible for a mix um I I'm not
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how the person can claim
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
co-ownership I would think they would be
 
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
able to show a um legal document that
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
there were two people who in in
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
agreement were were owning the dog
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
together um I don't know if the people
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
who are doing the Doggy Daycare
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
understand that if they've signed over
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
and become a co-owner with the owner of
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
the Doggy Daycare care that means that
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
they are liable if something happens if
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
the Doggy Daycare person makes a mistake
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
and somebody gets bitten and all that
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be liable for the
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
um any lawsuits as well as the Doggy
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
Daycare person you know say your dog
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
bites you know somebody else's on the
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
premises um it's not going to be the
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
Doggy Daycare operator who's just on the
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
line if the people are co-owners with
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
the Doggy Daycare owner I think I really
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a zoning issue um
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
in in Manchester I at somewhere along
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
the way I read a description of a
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
um I think it was a set of cond
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
condominiums or tow houses where they
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
had a limit on how many dogs you could
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
have you could have one dog of your own
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
and up to three days at a time for I
 
01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was a week or a month
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
you could babysit somebody else's dog
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
but you could only do it for one dog you
 
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
could only do it for a certain number of
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
days and that was to make sure that the
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
condo area didn't fill up with five
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
million barking little dogs but um I
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
thought that seemed extremely reasonable
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
that you could limit the number of of
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
dogs that were visiting for care um and
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
that might help take care of the problem
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
but again I see that as a more of a
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
zoning issue in one area as a state than
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
as a Statewide issue um I I know it was
 
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
said that nobody knows what co-ownership
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
means I think the place to look for that
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
information is AKC because that's the
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
only place I know of it actually being
 
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
in use um I don't know um I think the
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
people are very clever at trying
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
this you know but I I think you should
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
be able to ask them to provide proof of
 
01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:54.750 align:start position:0%
be able to ask them to provide proof of
co-ownership

01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
co-ownership
 
01:39:59.589 --> 01:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
um or proof or if the dog resides there
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
provide proof of Licensing and rabies
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
information because that's a public
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
health issue thank you representative
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair do you
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
share any concern about you know
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
somebody laying claim to co-ownership
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
that actually has no right to claiming
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
co-ownership and then there's also that
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
facet of the conversation yeah I I think
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
that that could turn really really bad
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
in ways they aren't anticipating like I
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
said all it would take is one bad
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
incident with a neighbor's kid or
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
something and poof everybody involved
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
loses their house you with lawsuits I it
 
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
could be I just don't I think they're
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
thinking this is a way to get around so
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
I can make money I'm also wondering if
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
they're running a business and taking in
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
money uh they registered with the state
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
as a business um are they reporting all
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
their income to the IRS boy that that
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
would really really ruin them send the
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
IRS their way and say hey they're taking
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
money under the table for doing
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
this but yeah I can see repercussions if
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
they with coers any other
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
questions represent Bixby yeah so it's
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's a been it's been a while since I've
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
looked at the uh group dog license
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
statutes but I'm wondering if
 
01:41:19.229 --> 01:41:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh if that
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
the excuse me the who um rep McKenzie uh
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh the um when the person
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
had was brought to court they showed a
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh a dog license with their name on it
 
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if that was a
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
potentially a group dog license where
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit harder to train to
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
track exactly which dogs there are but
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering off how that would work if
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
you had multiple co-owners of different
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
animals be ugly uh the in terms of the
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
group license I know I had to to give
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
the name and information on every single
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
dog that I had at my home and I had to
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
provide their rabies vaccination
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
information a group license doesn't just
 
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
mean have however many you want with no
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
record of what you have I mean you can
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
slide some stuff around where you only
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
have to re redo your group license once
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
a year you could slide around you got a
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
new puppy an old dog died you still got
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
the same number but you next year you're
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to update which dog is
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
which and approve the rabies
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations well I know uh
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I'm looking at the
 
01:42:35.589 --> 01:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
section four 466 colon 6 on group
 
01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
licenses and um there are five
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions here one of which the last
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
one upon request an owner or keeper
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
shall receive numbered license tags for
 
01:42:50.350 --> 01:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
each dog included under the owners or
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
keeper group license so I mean there's
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
that you could ask for uh or the
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
municipality could ask proof for group
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
ownership through um the license tag
 
01:43:08.109 --> 01:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
numbers and um it also says the owner or
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
keeper of five or more dogs shall
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
annually by April 30th pay the required
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
fee and obtain license authorizing the
 
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
owner or keeper to keep the dogs upon
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
the premises described in the license so
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the license is also the residence or
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
where the premises where the dog is
 
01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.629 align:start position:0%
where the premises where the dog is
being

01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:43:28.639 --> 01:43:30.350 align:start position:0%
being
kept

01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
kept
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so you know there's there's a number
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
of things in the group license here
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
which I would imagine the municipality
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
could use to prove co-ownership
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
is that true yeah or ownership you know
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
U the thing is I know that when I got a
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
group license I did know not ask them
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
for an individual tag for each of my
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
dogs because I had show dogs and my show
 
01:43:59.070 --> 01:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
dogs did not wear collars at all they're
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
all microchipped but Town didn't care
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
about that but because you don't want a
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
ring around the neck of fur that is
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
rubbed from a collar you just don't you
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
don't leave um collars on your showd
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
dogs or at least we didn't at the time I
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
had a long haired breed and it would be
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
really obvious that you know ring around
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
the collar um so I did not request I got
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
um they usually gave me like one tag or
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
I may have asked for two for my for my
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
two big dogs but the little dogs didn't
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
get a taged but I still had to list
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
every single dog I owned under that
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
group license and I had to prove to the
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
town hall that every single one of them
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
had had their rabies
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine okay thank you yeah any other
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
chair what's the enforcement of that was
 
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of that you can't get a
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
license unless you can prove rabies
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination so somebody has to find out
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
license there's a possibility that you
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
would not not have a license but if
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's claiming they have all these
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
co-owned dogs on their premises and that
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
they're taking care of them they should
 
01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:14.679 align:start position:0%
all be licensed to win proof of rabies
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination represent
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
Biby yeah so um
 
01:45:25.229 --> 01:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
this this bill might not be the the the
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
the right way of going about it but
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
would you what would you feel about
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
having a definition of co-ownership in
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
state law I think that would be really
 
01:45:37.229 --> 01:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
difficult because I'm getting the
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
impression that what I think of as
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
co-ownership which is a mutual
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiary relationship between two
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
people over ownership of a dog a
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
purebred dog for that matter is very
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
different from how they're throwing the
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
word around around in this Doggy Daycare
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
case so I think it would be difficult to
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
do represent Murray thank you madam
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
chair and I guess uh to representative
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
bixby's point I didn't we just establish
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is a legal
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
definition for animals and statute with
 
01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:09.470 align:start position:0%
definition for animals and statute with
regard

01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
regard
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
ownership this is yes we did with regard
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
to for the divorce yeah the the as we
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
said in RS say 458 Co
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
16-a um with regard to family law and
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
property settlement and divorce
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings they said that tangible
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
property shall include
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
animals um but but there's nothing there
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
that actually says Pro that that there's
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
proof of co-ownership right and the
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
other thing is that I believe that the
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
last line in that in in that statute
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
says that uh this what what what is
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned here only applies to this
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
particular case yeah to
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
right representative Howard thank you
 
01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so uh I think that maybe
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
I don't I would defer to the more
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people on this but I think
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe the uh definition might be
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
stronger if it has some reference to
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
residence or where the dog resides I
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
think that um you're mentioning of a a
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the um of it being a zoning issue he
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
already sort of um established that they
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
they had been turned down because of a
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
zoning problem right so and so they're
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
using this end run around it if if there
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
was a mention of of where the dog
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
actually resides even if it includes two
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
places um that that might make the
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
ownership definition stronger do you
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
think or um that that that could help in
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
determining you know where the dog
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
resided and and whether it should be be
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
there what I'm thinking
 
01:47:54.589 --> 01:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
is Manchester could do something like
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
saying you can have own as many dogs as
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
you want you got them licensed you got
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
their rabies vaccination and you can
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
change something so that you can babysit
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
X number of dogs like if you wanted to
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
take your mother-in-law's dog while she
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
went to Florida um something like that
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
um and limit the amount of time that
 
01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
that dog could be there so that you have
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
your own dogs you have a dog that your
 
01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
babysitting for you know somebody a
 
01:48:25.629 --> 01:48:25.639 align:start position:0%
relative or a friend but you can only
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
have one or maybe two dogs to babysit at
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
a time and you can only have them for so
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
many days out of a week or a month I
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
think that would resolve that Doggy
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
Daycare setup pretty good yeah I don't
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
know how you can enforce that though I
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
mean that seems like it would be really
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine how long
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
anybody's had a dog at their place or
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
how many hours a day or repr presum dsy
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah I agree that this would
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
probably something that could be done on
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
the municipal level but I mean basically
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
if we just look at the definition and do
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
like a proof of co-ownership of of
 
01:49:12.109 --> 01:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
animal co-ownership consists of you know
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
and then I mean it could be you know a a
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
notorized document with the name and
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
address of of both co-own you know and
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
then just listed out um I think that
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
that would give it some teeth and it
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
probably could be done at the municipal
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
level unless we wanted to take that on
 
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
as a state level but again you know I
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
think I always find this interesting
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
because I chair a Conservation
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
Commission that I call an urban
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission because it's so
 
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
different than conservation Commissions
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
in small communities and it's the same
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
thing here that this is a an issue issue
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%
that is more likely to occur in our
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
cities um because you know of our close
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
proximity you our our neighborhoods and
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
people wanting to open up something you
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
know for incremental income so um I
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if we need it Statewide but I
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
think the cities definitely need to look
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
at it right I think there may be a way
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
to to to define something good that the
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
cities could all use to add to their
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
zoning I don't believe this is said I
 
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
don't think this is going to get you
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
anywhere um I think the um the Crux of
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
the matter here is they're saying the
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
dogs are co-owned the my big question
 
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
for that co-ownership is where do the
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
dogs reside and where are they legally
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
licensed and we you know and with proof
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
of rabies vaccinations because it's if
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's from Massachusetts you know or if
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's from Bedford instead of Manchester
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
you know it it's just a it's just a
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
different thing um you know it's it's
 
01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:54.199 align:start position:0%
very tricky like I said I think the
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
people who are running that Doggy
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
Daycare are very
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
clever representative Bixby so do you
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
happen to know if when uh someone is uh
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
establishing co-ownership of a pure
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
breed dog whether uh they need to do a
 
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
health certificate uh to uh indicate
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
that transfer of that creation of
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
co-ownership no I don't believe so but
 
01:51:19.629 --> 01:51:19.639 align:start position:0%
there quite often there are lawyers
 
01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
involved because the co-ownership um
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
might be that I will take care of all
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
Veterinary bills or we will split all
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
Veterinary bills or um the dog will
 
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
reside with you for two years and after
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
that it will come back to me for
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
breeding purposes so there's there's all
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
kinds of I mean some of these contracts
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
are are really uh amaz and like I said
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's often a lawyer involved it's not
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
just a hi yeah you can be
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
co-owner representative Marie I know up
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
until this point we've talked about
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
individual people in co-ownership but
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
are there circumstances in which there
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
is a business entity that also lays
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
claim to ownership of an animal or
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
co-ownership like if there is a such and
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
such Corporation yes yeah a Consortium I
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
I I suppose there could be I'm sorry I
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
suppose there could be the the biggest
 
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
one I've seen and I don't know what the
 
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
contract looked like of course is there
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
were actually five dogs no five people
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
supporting one dog through the show
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
circuits and it was a that dog was being
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
campaigned from one side of the country
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
to the other so there's a lot of travel
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
involved a lot of professional handlers
 
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
involved and so on um so there was a lot
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
of I'm sure there was a lot of
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
contractual obligations and
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that each person signed
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
up for when they contributed money to be
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
part of the this particular dog campaign
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
and I know it probably sounds very
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
forign foreign to you all to to have a
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
dog that is competing like that I know I
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
never did the poor dogs were stuck with
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
me in the ring but um it it was uh and I
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually when I had one that became a
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
world champion I actually sold it to
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
somebody I knew who could campaign it
 
01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
the way they wanted to I didn't keep a
 
01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
co-ownership but it there's
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that go with the
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
co-ownership as well as you know the the
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
pleasure of owning the
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
dog and and I think each contract would
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
be different I I believe you know
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
somebody's mentioned maybe we could do
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
both parties signing a notorized
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
statement I think that would work to
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
have proof that the dog is co co-owned
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
but you know I'd suggest you run that by
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
your legal department and see what what
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
they think okay thank
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
you uh with that I'd like to call Angela
 
01:53:43.119 --> 01:53:44.589 align:start position:0%
you uh with that I'd like to call Angela
Ferrari

01:53:44.589 --> 01:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
Ferrari
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
sure now she's actually currently active
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
in the show
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the show
world

01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
move this out of the way behind you no
 
01:53:51.920 --> 01:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
move this out of the way behind you no
I'm

01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
back welcome to dog day at the
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture commit right
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I couldn't miss this
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
um hi Angela Ferrari president of dog
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
owners of the Granite State I think
 
01:54:22.109 --> 01:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
we've uh dug into a lot on this one I
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
have a few thoughts and comments just
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
from what I've been hearing and then
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
we'll open it up to questions that you
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
may have um while definitely being
 
01:54:33.790 --> 01:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the issue that raised
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and trying to find a solution
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
um we had primarily concerns around
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
where this documentation was going to go
 
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
and the privacy concerns that that would
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
have about personal information um so
 
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
with our dog licenses there is statute
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
RSA 466 colon
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
1-d that explicitly states that the
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
information provided on dog licenses
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
cannot be sold given out etc etc so that
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
locks it down and make sure that there's
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
no privacy concerns with that
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
information so if we are opening up to
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
proving co-ownership in some way we need
 
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we still have those
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
privacy safeguards in place um it was
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the dogs license itself
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
that seems like a good Avenue that the
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
municipality could use to confirm
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
ownership of the dog um obviously in
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
this case it's not that the dogs are
 
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
residing at this particular residence
 
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
but coming from another so that does
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
make that a bit trickier um but there
 
01:55:45.669 --> 01:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
was a lot of good conversation about the
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
notaries for co-ownership or different
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
things like that that I think could be
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
explored but it does seem that this is
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
something that should be addressed at
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
the municipal level rather than here uh
 
01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:56:01.149 --> 01:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
legislature um a question that I did
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
have which would be for the sponsor is
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
are the real owners we'll call them the
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
real owners the ones who are bringing
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
these dogs to the Doggy Daycare are they
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
agreeing with the daycare that they the
 
01:56:19.629 --> 01:56:19.639 align:start position:0%
daycare does co-own these dogs um if
 
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
they are participating in this facade of
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
co-ownership then I think it's going to
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
get really tricky with the way that this
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
bill is written regarding
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
registration um adoption records or
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership agreement or
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
pedigree records the license information
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's listed is the likely one that's
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
going to be the hardest
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
to um Swindle somebody with because for
 
01:56:51.310 --> 01:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
example I co-own all of my puppies I'm a
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
breeder of doberman's um and the
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
majority of my puppies that I sell I do
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
co-own and I do have a contract with the
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
owners for every single puppy um and for
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
those that I co-own It explicitly states
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
that I co-own a name only I do not have
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
any financial obligation or legal
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
obligation to the dog as the contract is
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
written the reason I stay on the dog is
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
for different reasons as Nancy mentioned
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh related to showing breeding different
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
things like that it may be uh a person
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
that you know hasn't purchased for me
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
before and I may be doing a payment plan
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
with them and so I'm remaining on the
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
registration until that payment is in
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
full different things like that um so
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
that I have the ability to take the dog
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
back if we were to have a dispute over
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
the dog or the contract or payments
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
however with my experience with that it
 
01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
is ex extremely easy to add a co-owner
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
to a registration so if these real
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
owners of these dogs are conspiring with
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
the daycare and that is the direction
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
they want to go they'll easily be able
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
to get their names on registrations they
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
can even have a contract that states
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's a name only different things that
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
could protect them down the road if
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
something were to come up would they go
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
through all of that trouble I'm not sure
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
there are fees associated with getting
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
on the registration of a dog they're
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
fairly minimal I wouldn't expect it to
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
be more than $40 per dog so that's about
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
one day's worth of daycare and if it's
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
worth it to them um to be trying to do
 
01:58:33.149 --> 01:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
this it's likely that they could do that
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
so I do think that it makes it difficult
 
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
to even prove beyond what we're trying
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
to do that these dogs are truly co-owned
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
by this
 
01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:46.229 align:start position:0%
by this
person

01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
um and I think that was those were kind
 
01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
of my questions and thoughts that I had
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I know we've had a lot of other
 
01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:56.679 align:start position:0%
answers from other people but if you had
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
further questions I would be happy to
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
them so do you think that it would be
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
more helpful in this situation
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
if say uh Doggy Daycare is identified as
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
a particular activity
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
enumerated in statutes
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere that the Secretary of State
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know you'd have to register in order
 
01:59:30.270 --> 01:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
to have a doggy
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
daycare and that would be the mechanism
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
that would allow municipalities to point
 
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
to that being a
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
business yeah I think it's interesting
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't have that defined
 
01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
especially with the popularity of doggy
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
day cares these days I don't know if
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
they are just establishing themselves as
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
a business and in order to sell and
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
offer services and have a facility and
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
all of the things that come along with
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
the larger scale doggy daycares um it
 
02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
may be a good Avenue it would lead into
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
more things too as far as inspections
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
potentially and making sure that their
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
facilities are appropriate to be housing
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
the animals depending on the level of
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
daycare that they're
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
offering okay any other
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
much and I guess this is something the
 
02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
committee is going to have
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:50.510 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
believe so that might one they are not
 
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
and okay so we'll have to look at
 
02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
statutes that said that mention boarding
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
and see if we can insert maybe doggy
 
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
daycares into that as well I don't
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
know we'll have to look at that
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
represent dsy but I I think the whole
 
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
issue here is that how can you deny me
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
the right to take care of my nephews and
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
my niece's dogs okay and I think that's
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
how they're so they're not so they're
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
indicating that this is not a business
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just taking care of dogs for friends
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
and that type type of thing and and
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's the real issue but I think it I
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
mean I think to the it's obvious to
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
everybody that they are running a
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
business the IRS is the best place to
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right I'm seeing
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
as there's no other um discussion on
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm going to close out uh the
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1 1316 and we will adjourn
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%

o'clock

02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.960 --> 03:01:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
fun

Littleton um before you today you've got
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:03:24.030 --> 03:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
1173 and I just want to give you a
 
03:03:26.990 --> 03:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
little background how I got involved in
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
in this it typically is not something
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
that I um focus my legislative efforts
 
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
on but I got a call from a a um a
 
03:03:39.070 --> 03:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
concerned citizen of the North Country
 
03:03:41.349 --> 03:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
um this person I've known for for a
 
03:03:44.990 --> 03:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
number of years and he is described a
 
03:03:46.990 --> 03:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
situation that occurred to him over the
 
03:03:50.190 --> 03:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
last year that was uh you know really he
 
03:03:52.229 --> 03:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
felt troubling and really didn't give a
 
03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
whole lot of um um opportunity for
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
justice if you will uh he is an attorney
 
03:04:00.190 --> 03:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I told him hey if I introduce this
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
bill you're going to have to come
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
testify and I've introduced the bill and
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh he got called to a court hearing so
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
he's uh he is not here but he did write
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
a letter which I've given to you um uh
 
03:04:13.110 --> 03:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage you to read it
 
03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
because it really gives the background
 
03:04:17.070 --> 03:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh for for where this bill is coming
 
03:04:19.309 --> 03:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
from uh I'm going to kind of just give
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
you some of the highlights but again I
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to to take a look at
 
03:04:26.550 --> 03:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
the the the letter this all went back uh
 
03:04:30.269 --> 03:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
about a year ago um when he was walking
 
03:04:32.190 --> 03:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
his dogs in a rural area he lives in a
 
03:04:35.670 --> 03:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
rural road in Lancaster and uh his dog
 
03:04:38.429 --> 03:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
was attacked by a neighboring dog and it
 
03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
was a violent attack um it left his dog
 
03:04:43.630 --> 03:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
injured ultimately he thought it was was
 
03:04:48.429 --> 03:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
dead dead and uh but it did come back um
 
03:04:51.990 --> 03:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you know looking for for you know
 
03:04:54.670 --> 03:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
some some justice in there
 
03:04:57.309 --> 03:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
and the the concern that he had the
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
problem that he had didn't necessarily
 
03:05:01.870 --> 03:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
happened after the first attack but
 
03:05:03.389 --> 03:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
shortly after his attack there was
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
another attack and another attack and uh
 
03:05:09.870 --> 03:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
and there was a small Municipal P fine
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
that was paid but but that was that was
 
03:05:15.269 --> 03:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
it um clearly a dog that attacks people
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
or other animals U four or five times is
 
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh we would all think probably something
 
03:05:22.630 --> 03:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be done but again as an
 
03:05:26.229 --> 03:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
attorney he examined the law and uh
 
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
found there wasn't a lot of recourse
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
with that so before you I have uh 1173
 
03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a one one paragraph um and it
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
starts on the new it's uh part of RSA
 
03:05:42.750 --> 03:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
46631 and inserts a new paragraph
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
starting at line eight it just and again
 
03:05:47.710 --> 03:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
I feel that this is a very reasonable
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
approach to it um it talks about a
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
domestic animal
 
03:05:55.469 --> 03:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
that which that attacks a human being or
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
a dog that attacks a human being or
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
another um domestic animal where a
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
puncture or tearing of skin occurs so
 
03:06:05.269 --> 03:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
this isn't a nip this isn't uh you know
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
a puppy uh doing doing things that
 
03:06:10.110 --> 03:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
puppies do um but this is where there
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
was an actual bite uh going on and if it
 
03:06:15.389 --> 03:06:15.399 align:start position:0%
happen two or more times within a 12
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
Monon period so again frequent I mean
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's not if you got a dog I think I mean
 
03:06:24.790 --> 03:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
I I've I've had dogs that bit once twice
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
in their whole lifetime um but this is
 
03:06:30.110 --> 03:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
this is here we made it so there is a a
 
03:06:32.110 --> 03:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
pattern of biting
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
established um and if that happens uh so
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
you got to have the puncture of skin and
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
two or more times in a 12month period
 
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
That's evidence that the dog is vicious
 
03:06:45.070 --> 03:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
and the dog will be taken into custody
 
03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
by the the the police Constable or other
 
03:06:49.950 --> 03:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
persons authorized and the court shall
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
order the dog euthanized so um it uh it
 
03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
provides a pathway for vicious dogs to
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
be removed from the community and the
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
threat to the public eliminated um so
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the bill uh and I'd be
 
03:07:08.070 --> 03:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take some questions okay thank
 
03:07:08.080 --> 03:07:10.190 align:start position:0%
happy to take some questions okay thank
you

03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
 
03:07:18.190 --> 03:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Howard um is
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
this does this need to be a state law I
 
03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
know that in my town I had a similar
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
experience to your wife's to the the
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
person's wife um where the dog attacked
 
03:07:31.309 --> 03:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
my dog was able to pull him off before
 
03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
he was but he had him by the throat
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
right and um when we reported it to the
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
police the the police said that that dog
 
03:07:40.429 --> 03:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
needed to be restrained and if he was
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
ever in an off leash not even just was
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
attacking another dog with off leash he
 
03:07:48.229 --> 03:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
would be taken and euthanized so um so
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that's at the Town level do we do we
 
03:07:52.110 --> 03:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
really need a state CLA for this yeah
 
03:07:54.910 --> 03:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
and again this is uh this
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
is this this the person that asked me to
 
03:08:00.190 --> 03:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
put this is an attorney and he he
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
examined and and studied the law and he
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
felt that this is the most adequate
 
03:08:06.870 --> 03:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
solution for for a circumstance where
 
03:08:09.510 --> 03:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a proven history of of
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
vicious dog
 
03:08:14.110 --> 03:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
attacks any other
 
03:08:16.590 --> 03:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
dsy representative I I don't know this
 
03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
but uh can vicious dogs be
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated uh I mean especially if
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
they're like abused or anything like
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
that or is it once they go in that
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
direction that's
 
03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
it uh that I don't know I'm uh I I I I'm
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
not a dog expert uh by any means so I
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
wish I could answer your question I
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for
 
03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
questions well I know no representative
 
03:08:53.710 --> 03:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
um Bixby sorry yeah so um representative
 
03:08:57.830 --> 03:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
Howard mentioned that uh in her town the
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh the solution that the the local law
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement suggested was uh requiring
 
03:09:08.030 --> 03:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
that the dog be restrained which seems
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
to be a um perhaps less drastic solution
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
than um than
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
euthanasia would you be um comfortable
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
with having a a a less severe punishment
 
03:09:23.550 --> 03:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
for the dog you know I think the um
 
03:09:27.550 --> 03:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
the the the anything that could prevent
 
03:09:29.630 --> 03:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
this from happening for a dog that's
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
been shown to be vicious and have a
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
pattern I think would be a very
 
03:09:35.990 --> 03:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
agreeable solution I mean the goal of
 
03:09:37.150 --> 03:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
this is to
 
03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
prevent vicious dogs from continually
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
attacking um people or or other animals
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
so if the committee feels that that
 
03:09:49.750 --> 03:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
would uh uh accomplish that um by all
 
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
means I think that would be a um an
 
03:09:52.880 --> 03:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
means I think that would be a um an
adequate

03:09:54.790 --> 03:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
03:09:59.710 --> 03:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
solution according to current statute
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
though and and we acknowledge in in law
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
that you know there are there can be um
 
03:10:10.750 --> 03:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
if if the if a animal runs after chases
 
03:10:15.150 --> 03:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
bicycles Motor Vehicles um if
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
they um growl snaps that runs after or
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
chases any person so those are those are
 
03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
dogs that are considered a menace a
 
03:10:28.670 --> 03:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
nuisance or
 
03:10:32.110 --> 03:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
vicious um and and and the law already
 
03:10:35.309 --> 03:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
alludes to the fact and acknowled
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that they're the owners
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
hold liability to that um so it would
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
seem to me that you just report that to
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
the authorities and the authorities
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
would take action to make sure that the
 
03:10:53.830 --> 03:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
dog owner either restrains the animal or
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
watches the animal or you know somehow
 
03:11:00.030 --> 03:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
corrects this situation from happening
 
03:11:04.229 --> 03:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
again yeah so I think that um and we
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
discussed that and I think he he
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
highlighted that in his letter in that
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
you he went to the the authorities and
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
it was a fine and the dog owner just
 
03:11:14.910 --> 03:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
paid the fine I mean they they were of
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
means they didn't care what it cost and
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
they would pay the fine and pay the fine
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
and pay the fine and there was a pattern
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
of that so this uh the goal would be to
 
03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
elevate it up into a serious or more
 
03:11:30.389 --> 03:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
serious um uh consequence for for
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
pattern for
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
multiple and again the the the important
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
thing of the bill is there's a pattern
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a onetime thing it's not a once
 
03:11:41.870 --> 03:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
every five years it's a it's a pattern
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a serious ious of of the attack
 
03:11:46.510 --> 03:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
you know where there's skin broken
 
03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's a puncture wound um these aren't
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
minor these aren't minor this isn't
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
Menace this isn't growling this isn't
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
chasing this is a you know a vicious uh
 
03:11:58.309 --> 03:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
assault but but according to the statute
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the way it's written now any person who
 
03:12:02.830 --> 03:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
fails by appropriate action including
 
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
but not limited to restraining an animal
 
03:12:06.429 --> 03:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
from running at large or otherwise
 
03:12:09.710 --> 03:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
effectively abating a nuisance found
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
such under the the provisions of this
 
03:12:14.590 --> 03:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
section or who fails to comply with any
 
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
other provisions of this section after
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
being so ordered shall have the person's
 
03:12:22.110 --> 03:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
dog taken into custody by the police of
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
the city Constable of the town or other
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
person authorized by the town and such
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
disposition made of the dog as the court
 
03:12:34.030 --> 03:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
May order so there's a remedy here I
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
mean if if the person can pay a fine but
 
03:12:39.229 --> 03:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
obviously if this is something that's
 
03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing yeah um it would I would imagine
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would get involved here
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and say look it you're not doing your
 
03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
job we're going to confiscate your
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
animal right and and I wish that he was
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
here to to address that because I know
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
he did the research on it but I will
 
03:12:54.590 --> 03:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
have him follow up with with the
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee to uh explain why those
 
03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
remedies weren't weren't to his
 
03:13:02.790 --> 03:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
satisfaction thank you representative H
 
03:13:05.229 --> 03:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:13:08.190 --> 03:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
representative would you imagine that
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
different municipalities have different
 
03:13:14.750 --> 03:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement measures depending on
 
03:13:19.150 --> 03:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
their personnel and perhaps how their
 
03:13:23.469 --> 03:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
um authorities undertake these
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
situations yeah I would I mean just in
 
03:13:28.349 --> 03:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
my district in Littleton Littleton is a
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
more I want to say Urban it's not far
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
from Urban but uh it's got neighborhoods
 
03:13:35.550 --> 03:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
in a main street in a business section
 
03:13:39.229 --> 03:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
and then in my my town of Lyman that I
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
there's really the Lyman town hall and
 
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
there's is really not a whole lot of uh
 
03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
um um development if you will so I would
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
imagine there are different uh resources
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
available locally from Littleton versus
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
Lyman who doesn't have a police officer
 
03:13:57.710 --> 03:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't have you know don't have a
 
03:14:00.269 --> 03:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
police station um whereas Littleton is a
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
much more developed area so yeah I would
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that yes thank you
 
03:14:06.190 --> 03:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:14:07.630 --> 03:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
question um given that it um an RSA 446
 
03:14:14.269 --> 03:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
colon 31 uh like the chair had mentioned
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
regarding musling and Restraint of dogs
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
as a potential remedy do you think that
 
03:14:23.550 --> 03:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
the court might or could possibly find
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
um a remedy to be that a a dog be
 
03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
muzzled and also attend behavior
 
03:14:31.550 --> 03:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
modification classes or some sort of
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
other uh remedy that before youth in
 
03:14:38.910 --> 03:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
Asia yeah and again I I having doing
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
this on behalf of somebody who is in the
 
03:14:42.750 --> 03:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
courts every day um you know works in
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
the courts uh I I would have to imagine
 
03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
that was pursued uh I don't have a
 
03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
definitive answer for that but um um
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
knowing knowing you know a little bit of
 
03:14:58.910 --> 03:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
the background and and how we got here
 
03:15:02.670 --> 03:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
um I would be surprised if those Avenues
 
03:15:06.070 --> 03:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
were pursued uh uh
 
03:15:08.790 --> 03:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
or surprised if those ad those Avenues
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
did not I'm surprised if he didn't try
 
03:15:13.389 --> 03:15:13.399 align:start position:0%
all the Avenues that available to him
 
03:15:14.670 --> 03:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's probably what I should say
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
represent viby so you said that that
 
03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's a fine levied was that fine
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
levied by the municipality or was that
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
levied by the court uh I believe that I
 
03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have an answer for that
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just I'm just trying to
 
03:15:30.550 --> 03:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
figure out whether this was actually
 
03:15:33.870 --> 03:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
seen by a judge who uh determined the
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
disposition or whether it was not
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
actually brought to court because that
 
03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
could make a difference in terms of the
 
03:15:42.670 --> 03:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
section of law that the uh Sheriff
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
person cited uh the the the difference
 
03:15:50.670 --> 03:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
between having it settled with in just
 
03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
just by law enforcement or settled uh in
 
03:15:55.870 --> 03:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
court makes a really a big difference
 
03:15:59.630 --> 03:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the things I'm since we
 
03:16:02.309 --> 03:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
have do have that section of law it does
 
03:16:04.830 --> 03:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
give the the uh the court a fair amount
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
of discretion in terms of what they deem
 
03:16:12.510 --> 03:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
a remedy uh so uh I I I feel like I'm
 
03:16:12.520 --> 03:16:13.670 align:start position:0%
a remedy uh so uh I I I feel like I'm
hesitant

03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
hesitant
 
03:16:19.590 --> 03:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
to uh to to require youth in Asia and uh
 
03:16:22.750 --> 03:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
have it supered the what could be done
 
03:16:25.189 --> 03:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
with with judicial supervision sure and
 
03:16:26.590 --> 03:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
I will you know I'm taking notes here
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to make sure that these
 
03:16:29.309 --> 03:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
get followed up you know from his
 
03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
experience and where where he went on
 
03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:32.030 align:start position:0%
experience and where where he went on
that

03:16:32.030 --> 03:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
certainly representative
 
03:16:37.229 --> 03:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
smart did your friend um talk to the
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
state bet at all to see what the state
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
statute was on vicious dogs or dogs I I
 
03:16:45.870 --> 03:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if he talked to the vet
 
03:16:48.910 --> 03:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
per se but I know that he did research
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know his did his own research on the
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
on the statute because the the line that
 
03:16:55.469 --> 03:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
you put in section B was that line 8
 
03:16:59.229 --> 03:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
through 12 is the law already as far as
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
I know at least it was 50 years ago when
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:07.229 --> 03:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
field yeah that's when when we work we
 
03:17:08.910 --> 03:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
worked with OS and said this is where we
 
03:17:11.229 --> 03:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
want they they it's already they added
 
03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
that well no they added the the stuff in
 
03:17:15.229 --> 03:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
bold 8 through 12 is what what OS added
 
03:17:19.150 --> 03:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill in LSR yeah that covers the
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
law though well RSA 466 colon
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
31-a has a number of penalties for first
 
03:17:28.750 --> 03:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
assum first offense
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
$25 second offense $100 and the uh $100
 
03:17:37.910 --> 03:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the first vicious offense um $400
 
03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
for the second or subsequent vicious
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
offense is committed within 12 months so
 
03:17:46.189 --> 03:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
there is a schedule of you know of um
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.910 --> 03:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
um they have also the any person who
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
pays a civil forfeiture specified in the
 
03:17:59.349 --> 03:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
above paragraph two times in any
 
03:18:01.189 --> 03:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
12-month period according to the records
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the town or city clerk may not pay a
 
03:18:06.990 --> 03:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
civil forfeiture for subsequent
 
03:18:10.030 --> 03:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
violations um and and but she'll have
 
03:18:11.870 --> 03:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
those cases disposed of in District or
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
min ipal court
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
so as as there are subsequent
 
03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
attacks uh it would seem that that they
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
would eventually end up in court with
 
03:18:25.550 --> 03:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
this and the court would then decide
 
03:18:26.910 --> 03:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
what would happen What would have to
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
happen with the
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
animal so I think this is all pretty
 
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
well covered in 466 colon
 
03:18:38.030 --> 03:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
31-a what I'm going to do is I'll take
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
this back and um you know he he's he's
 
03:18:43.070 --> 03:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
the one that I said I did this on behalf
 
03:18:45.389 --> 03:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
of a constituent and we'll sure we'll uh
 
03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
we'll see if I
 
03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:50.229 align:start position:0%
we'll see if I
maybe

03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:18:52.150 --> 03:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
misrepresented but I don't think so I
 
03:18:53.710 --> 03:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
think I really do think that he covered
 
03:18:56.510 --> 03:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
it so we'll find out where where he uh
 
03:18:58.150 --> 03:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
where he's where he's looking for thank
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
you all right any other
 
03:19:02.750 --> 03:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions no all right thank you very
 
03:19:05.469 --> 03:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
much I'll call Robert
 
03:19:08.150 --> 03:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
Johnson from New Hampshire Farm
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you for joining us
 
03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:16.469 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank you for joining us
today

03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Rob Johnson
 
03:19:21.550 --> 03:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Farm beer was
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
a federation's policy director thank
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
you this this bill really grabbed the
 
03:19:30.990 --> 03:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
attention of our membership when they
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
saw it for particularly what it could
 
03:19:36.510 --> 03:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
mean for working dogs do just doing the
 
03:19:39.389 --> 03:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
jobs job they are are
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
trained the uh the proposed language we
 
03:19:46.590 --> 03:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
see is is is is quite
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
inflexible um I mean two times
 
03:19:51.229 --> 03:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances as representative Bixby
 
03:19:55.870 --> 03:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there's you know
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
little discretion there and that the
 
03:20:00.309 --> 03:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
existing statute does provide that I
 
03:20:01.790 --> 03:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to dra also draw to your
 
03:20:05.189 --> 03:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
attention to another RSA but may I think
 
03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
address this particular situation if I
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
understood it correctly that the sponsor
 
03:20:13.790 --> 03:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh cited that's RSA 466 in 28 titled
 
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
killing dogs legalized it reads any
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
person may kill a dog that suddenly
 
03:20:20.510 --> 03:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
assaults the person while such person is
 
03:20:22.990 --> 03:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
peaceably walking or riding without the
 
03:20:25.710 --> 03:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
enclosure of its owner or keeper and any
 
03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
person may kill a dog that is f that is
 
03:20:30.429 --> 03:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
found out of the enclosure or immediate
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
care of its owner or keeper worrying
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
wounding or killing sheep Lambs fowble
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
animals and I'll leave my testimony at

New Hampshire which represent thousands
 
03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
of constituent dog owners we too have
 
03:21:38.349 --> 03:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about HB
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
1173 and the way it's uh been drafted in
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
terms of of requiring the court to label
 
03:21:46.110 --> 03:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
as vicious and euthanize any dog that
 
03:21:48.269 --> 03:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
attacks humans or domestic animals
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
resulting in the puncture or tearing of
 
03:21:52.349 --> 03:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
skin two or more times in a 12-month
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
period uh if you read the bill it
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
basically is um referring in line 10
 
03:22:00.830 --> 03:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
that this shall be per se evidence so
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
strict liability and un we do support
 
03:22:06.189 --> 03:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
and believe dog owners should be
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for their dogs and we do
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
support laws that establish a fair
 
03:22:14.189 --> 03:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
process by which specific dogs are
 
03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
identified as dangerous based on stated
 
03:22:19.790 --> 03:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
measurable actions and imposing
 
03:22:22.269 --> 03:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate penalties on irresponsible
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
owners um we do believe it's important
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
to establish a well- defined method for
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with dogs proven to be dangerous
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
but as written
 
03:22:34.950 --> 03:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
1173 would eliminate the Court's Fair
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
process of determining on a caseby Case
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
basis whether the dog was provoked
 
03:22:42.269 --> 03:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
engaged in the protection of other
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
animals or property or its own um its
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
own domain or they were responding to a
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
situation where the victim might have
 
03:22:54.469 --> 03:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
been trespassing on the owner's property
 
03:22:56.950 --> 03:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of conditions or
 
03:22:59.550 --> 03:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances when a dog might attack
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
and one could consider that as
 
03:23:04.189 --> 03:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate or reasonable uh for them to
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
do so and our belief is that as written
 
03:23:10.790 --> 03:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
the current law would allow that type of
 
03:23:13.710 --> 03:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
discretion in front of the court I'm I'm
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
not clear and listening to the bill
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor whether or not um the
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who had this unfortunate
 
03:23:22.630 --> 03:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
situation of repeated attacks were
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
unable to uh file a complaint in court
 
03:23:29.429 --> 03:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
or not after understanding that civil
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
fines had been paid for the um prior
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
prior uh injuries um but by doing so and
 
03:23:40.349 --> 03:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
making this basically just strict
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
liability uh the the bill fails to
 
03:23:44.590 --> 03:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
recognize working dogs such as police
 
03:23:47.389 --> 03:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
canines for instance livestock Guardian
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
dogs and others um so our understanding
 
03:24:12.030 --> 03:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
who have adopted ordinances that may and
 
03:24:18.070 --> 03:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just speaking from my experience in
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing um municiple ordinances and
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
statutes across New England um based on
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
an attack there may be conditions around
 
03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
confinement for instance uh restricting
 
03:24:33.590 --> 03:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
the uh release of a dog from confinement
 
03:24:37.630 --> 03:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
only by uh someone who's not a minor uh
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
requiring additional homeowners
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
insurance you know certain Provisions if
 
03:24:44.189 --> 03:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
there is a pattern of uh of a dog
 
03:24:47.469 --> 03:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
engaging in inappropriate vicious
 
03:24:50.990 --> 03:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
conduct um and that due process or Fair
 
03:24:53.750 --> 03:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
process in terms of some model
 
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
language can in fact include a process
 
03:25:00.750 --> 03:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
where that label is even removed after
 
03:25:02.990 --> 03:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
behavior modification or or other
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
training so I'm just sharing that from
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
what I've seen in other jurisdictions if
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's of um benefit to the committee
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:18.030 --> 03:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you that was a lot I
 
03:25:31.229 --> 03:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
day good afternoon Madam chair m members
 
03:25:43.870 --> 03:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee Angela Ferrari again
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
dog owners of the Granite State um the
 
03:25:48.630 --> 03:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
great thing about not having to go first
 
03:25:51.429 --> 03:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
is so many important facts have already
 
03:25:53.229 --> 03:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
been stated to you that I don't need to
 
03:25:56.590 --> 03:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
repeat um just going to highlight a few
 
03:26:00.189 --> 03:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
things with comparing this bill to
 
03:26:03.510 --> 03:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
current law um it seems that as it's
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
already been stated under 466 colon 31a
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
penalties that we do have a Avenue to
 
03:26:14.830 --> 03:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
address these type of issues um already
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned in there is if within a
 
03:26:20.429 --> 03:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
12-month period vicious behavior is seen
 
03:26:23.790 --> 03:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
within uh up to two times that this can
 
03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
be brought to the court and I think it's
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
more important to know that we do have
 
03:26:30.590 --> 03:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
that Avenue to pursue where we can have
 
03:26:32.590 --> 03:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
a court assess the
 
03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
situation um because right now we're
 
03:26:40.189 --> 03:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
where we would be removing Juris Juris
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
judicial excuse me discretion and
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
undermining the due process rights of
 
03:26:46.349 --> 03:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
the owners of these dogs if we were
 
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
immediately going to jump to euthanasia
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the case of these situations um as
 
03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
stated by others there are often times
 
03:26:57.870 --> 03:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
instances where it may have been
 
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the puncture or tearing
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
of skin um by a dog that wouldn't result
 
03:27:07.830 --> 03:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the need for euthanasia necessarily a
 
03:27:10.110 --> 03:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
few other things that came to mind um as
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about this bill is what
 
03:27:17.030 --> 03:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
about the case of a dog fight where two
 
03:27:18.990 --> 03:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
different individuals may be intervening
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
to separate the dogs and both were bit
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh or their skin was torn during that
 
03:27:27.189 --> 03:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
event and that would actually be two
 
03:27:31.590 --> 03:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
different instances of that type of
 
03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
um um tearing of skin in a 12mon period
 
03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
would then they be able to go to the
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
court and say this dog needs to be used
 
03:27:43.269 --> 03:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
IED even though it was only in the case
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
of One technical event but two different
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
people had their skin torn um and you
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
know dogs do fight I have Doberman um
 
03:27:55.550 --> 03:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
although they generally always get along
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are the cases when they decide to
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
have a little scuffle and I tell you
 
03:28:02.110 --> 03:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
that I don't try to get in between them
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
um because they're not going to
 
03:28:07.710 --> 03:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
intentionally bite me or hurt me but
 
03:28:09.790 --> 03:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's they're animals they're in the
 
03:28:12.790 --> 03:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
moment and it could happen happen and if
 
03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
there is a dog fight you often see two
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
people who are going to try and get in
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
there separate the dogs and put
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
themselves at risk that could put the
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
dog or dogs at Jeopardy um if this bill
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
was to move forward there's other cases
 
03:28:31.070 --> 03:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
where one dog may instigate a fight um
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
and this is why I don't bring my dogs to
 
03:28:35.030 --> 03:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
dog parks one having Doberman if
 
03:28:37.389 --> 03:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
something if one dog starts something if
 
03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
my dog was to finish it they're going to
 
03:28:41.389 --> 03:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
be the one that looks like the problem
 
03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
dog just because the stigmatism of the
 
03:28:46.349 --> 03:28:46.359 align:start position:0%
breed but in general if one dog was to
 
03:28:49.150 --> 03:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
instigate a situation but other dogs are
 
03:28:51.790 --> 03:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
protecting themselves and they were to
 
03:28:54.590 --> 03:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
in turn bite the dog that instigated the
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
situation um if or if multiple dogs were
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
to instigate you could also then have
 
03:29:02.469 --> 03:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
instances where now we're starting to
 
03:29:05.389 --> 03:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
rack up potential charges against the
 
03:29:07.830 --> 03:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
dog within that 12-month period and
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
these would just be examples of things
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
that you know can happen happen with
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
animals um that could be making these
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
type of decisions for themselves just to
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
protect themselves mentioned previously
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
with the working dogs um by Mr Johnson
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
from the Farm Bureau their job is to
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
protect the property and there are
 
03:29:27.910 --> 03:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
domestic animals involved in that
 
03:29:32.150 --> 03:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
situation as well so not to continue on
 
03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh too much further I would take any
 
03:29:37.150 --> 03:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
questions but we do feel that this is
 
03:29:39.309 --> 03:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
already covered well under the laws that
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
we already have in place thank
 
03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
you any questions from Miss
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
Ferrari no thank you very much
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um would call now uh Nancy
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%

bill

03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:21.910 --> 03:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
welcome again thank you name's Nancy
 
03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
Holmes I'm still from New Boston except
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
if I don't ever go home my husband may
 
03:30:29.429 --> 03:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
change my mind on that but uh anyway um
 
03:30:31.389 --> 03:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
I'm here on my behalf and also that of
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
Jay finy hopefully you all have written
 
03:30:38.070 --> 03:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from Jay and he um asked me to
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh correct with you a typo that went was
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
was in his was in the third paragraph of
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
his testimony you'll see RSA 431 d a and
 
03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
it was intended to be
 
03:30:51.760 --> 03:30:53.910 align:start position:0%
it was intended to be
466

03:30:53.910 --> 03:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
466
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
31a so he um I he sent me a copy of his
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
testimony so I could see it and I went
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
oh I think you sent in a typo so he prob
 
03:31:04.269 --> 03:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
probably like me has a sticky key
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere it doesn't actually type when
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
he hits it anyway he brought up two
 
03:31:11.389 --> 03:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
points that I found pretty pretty
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
Germain is that we have in um law let
 
03:31:19.490 --> 03:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
see if I can find it now here is
 
03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.030 align:start position:0%
see if I can find it now here is
[Music]

03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:31:26.590 --> 03:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
um H uh let's see RSA 467 in its
 
03:31:29.229 --> 03:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
entirity alludes to and acknowledges the
 
03:31:32.830 --> 03:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
fact that liability belongs to the
 
03:31:35.550 --> 03:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
owners of trespassing lives act so for
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
for for instance if the neighbor's free
 
03:31:39.429 --> 03:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
range chickens are in your dog pen and
 
03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
your dog decides to have chicken for
 
03:31:46.189 --> 03:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
dinner it's not your dog's fault um and
 
03:31:48.030 --> 03:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
I'm so somewhere in his testimony he
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
also states that there is a um a a law
 
03:31:56.429 --> 03:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
that that has um information on how dogs
 
03:31:57.990 --> 03:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
will stand their ground on their
 
03:31:59.830 --> 03:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
territory that they will defend their
 
03:32:02.630 --> 03:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
territory from either stray animals or
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
people um I I believe our current law is
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient and that the problem may be
 
03:32:11.550 --> 03:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
that it is not being enforced
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
the new addition strictly states that no
 
03:32:17.550 --> 03:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
matter what dog bites twice it's
 
03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
dead um are current law states that if
 
03:32:24.269 --> 03:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
your dog has bitten people or animals or
 
03:32:27.910 --> 03:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you um the court shall decide
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
for the disposition of the
 
03:32:33.070 --> 03:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
animal if a man comes on your property
 
03:32:35.550 --> 03:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
and is tempts to take a kit and you can
 
03:32:39.750 --> 03:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
pick goat or child as you please um and
 
03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
your dog bites the Hat heck out of that
 
03:32:45.710 --> 03:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
guy is your dog a vicious dog I mean
 
03:32:47.070 --> 03:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's so many different
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
reasons if your livestock Guardian dog
 
03:32:53.189 --> 03:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
um takes out a dog that's trying to eat
 
03:32:53.199 --> 03:32:53.950 align:start position:0%
um takes out a dog that's trying to eat
the

03:32:53.950 --> 03:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
Sheep is your dog a vicious dog or is it
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
doing his job our current law takes all
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
of that into consideration that there
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
are situations where dogs are doing
 
03:33:08.030 --> 03:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
their job when they bite um there's
 
03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
other situations of course where a dog
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
is out of control control it is not
 
03:33:14.469 --> 03:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
under the control of its owner it is not
 
03:33:17.070 --> 03:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
on its own property and that's where
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
current law comes into place it says a
 
03:33:20.590 --> 03:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
judge should make a determination on
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
what should happen to that dog you know
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
some people may be willing to put their
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
dog in a 6x10 covered pen that it can't
 
03:33:29.070 --> 03:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
escape from and keep their dog that way
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
to keep the public safe you don't know a
 
03:33:32.910 --> 03:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
judge could take something like that
 
03:33:32.920 --> 03:33:33.750 align:start position:0%
judge could take something like that
into

03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:33:36.750 --> 03:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
consideration um I think strictly
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
mandating that a dog dies simply for
 
03:33:43.070 --> 03:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
having bitten some somebody twice um I
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
think the police would have a hard time
 
03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
with that if their police dogs were put
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
down for that um I think puppy owners
 
03:33:50.429 --> 03:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
would have a hard time with that those
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
people who are raising puppies of a
 
03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
breed that is a mouthy bitey kind of dog
 
03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
that you've got to work with and I'm
 
03:34:00.830 --> 03:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
think some of you may be able to think
 
03:34:03.950 --> 03:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
of those um that would that would be
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
terrible to say okay your puppy has to
 
03:34:08.670 --> 03:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
die because it's bitten two kids um you
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
know and some somebody asked I don't
 
03:34:14.070 --> 03:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
remember representative bisy asked about
 
03:34:18.349 --> 03:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating a dog and the answer is
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
from what I can
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
see and what I have
 
03:34:26.349 --> 03:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
handled if you have a dog that does not
 
03:34:28.590 --> 03:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
have any bite inhibition that is it does
 
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
not control the strength of its bite
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
when it uses its
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
mouth you may be able to gain control of
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
that dog's Behavior by putting it under
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
your strict control but you probably
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
probably not ever going to stop that
 
03:34:46.429 --> 03:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
situation where the dog is going to use
 
03:34:48.429 --> 03:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
a full bite if it determines it's going
 
03:34:50.950 --> 03:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
to bite um this is something you teach
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
baby puppies that oh humans are delicate
 
03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
you you can't put teeth on us you know
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
and you we we'll we'll really be upset
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
and hurt um and adult dogs teach puppies
 
03:35:03.550 --> 03:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
this too they whack them around if they
 
03:35:05.790 --> 03:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
bite them too hard and they they they
 
03:35:07.189 --> 03:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
give them a hard time so puppies learn
 
03:35:09.389 --> 03:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
to control their mouth a puppy that is
 
03:35:11.670 --> 03:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
raised and does not learn that when they
 
03:35:13.349 --> 03:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
get to be an adult they're going to use
 
03:35:16.830 --> 03:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
their full bite um so I think if you if
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
you ever watch the dog wh for program
 
03:35:21.630 --> 03:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see that he is not um teaching
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
the dogs not to bite he's teaching the
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
owners how to control the dogs which is
 
03:35:27.870 --> 03:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
a very different thing so anyway that
 
03:35:29.309 --> 03:35:29.319 align:start position:0%
that's my point on this I think our
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
current law is perfectly fine and allows
 
03:35:37.870 --> 03:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
for judicial discretion and um you know
 
03:35:40.150 --> 03:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that this did not occur for the
 
03:35:42.750 --> 03:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
person up north that the um that it
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
never made it to court um I I think that
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
it's an Enforcement issue not a law is
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
not right issue so yapped on along
 
03:35:54.990 --> 03:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
enough if you got any questions happy to
 
03:35:57.710 --> 03:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
answer them thank you appreciate it and
 
03:36:00.269 --> 03:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for uh bringing forth the
 
03:36:03.870 --> 03:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
comments for uh Mr finy who can't be
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
here um I do want to comment that you
 
03:36:09.870 --> 03:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking through um RSA 467 in
 
03:36:11.229 --> 03:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
its entire
 
03:36:14.429 --> 03:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
and it does talk about um the owners of
 
03:36:18.030 --> 03:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
bulls and stallions and Rams and wild
 
03:36:22.590 --> 03:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
Wars and uh the liability
 
03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
um and yes in in its entirety and what
 
03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
it this RSA speaks of it is true that it
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
alludes to and acknowledges the fact
 
03:36:37.469 --> 03:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
that the liability does belong to the
 
03:36:40.510 --> 03:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
owners of the trespassing livestock so
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a dog that is trespassing on
 
03:36:44.349 --> 03:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
your property and running around and
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
biting your kids um that's a problem and
 
03:36:51.070 --> 03:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
that is something that law enforcement y
 
03:36:54.510 --> 03:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be told about yeah so I would
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
take I would take a wild guess and say
 
03:36:57.830 --> 03:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
that that dog that up north that was
 
03:37:00.750 --> 03:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
causing is causing such issues has that
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
um expanded view of what its territory
 
03:37:06.309 --> 03:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
is uh just just because it's the dog
 
03:37:08.189 --> 03:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
suit doesn't mean it's the right one but
 
03:37:09.870 --> 03:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
I think that that sounded like what was
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
going on to me from what I heard thank
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative Murray
 
03:37:16.349 --> 03:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
I actually don't have a question for the
 
03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
the speaker I had a just a question
 
03:37:22.150 --> 03:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
about testimony from the previous
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
sorry if you're done with me I'll let
 
03:37:32.030 --> 03:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
her have the chair representative Duty
 
03:37:32.040 --> 03:37:33.590 align:start position:0%
her have the chair representative Duty
oh

03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
darn uh Miss Holmes do do you know you
 
03:37:39.710 --> 03:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
know what you mention we hear often one
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
of non- enforcement or you know LAX
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh do you know of any
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
training programs for law enforcement on
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
our animal control laws or is that
 
03:37:58.750 --> 03:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
something that we should be considering
 
03:38:01.309 --> 03:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
is it I'm not sure is it part of like
 
03:38:05.469 --> 03:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
the um training program at nhti you know
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
for La en think that there was a
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
training program or a partial one um um
 
03:38:13.630 --> 03:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
I think the the person that might be
 
03:38:15.429 --> 03:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
able to answer that is commissioner
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
Jasper about from from the Department of
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
AG I think that might have been one of
 
03:38:22.469 --> 03:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
the places that and I think um one of
 
03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
the Humane Societies maybe had training
 
03:38:28.110 --> 03:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
programs for handling the laws but I you
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
know it wouldn't have been mandatory it
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
would have been you know voluntary um I
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
I think the police just like many others
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot on their plate and what they
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
know um
 
03:38:44.110 --> 03:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
and it always behooves like an owner to
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know if your dog is attacked it
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
behooves you to know what the law is
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
about getting recourse for it or the
 
03:38:52.110 --> 03:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
very least finding a lawyer who can do
 
03:38:53.309 --> 03:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
that for
 
03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry I hope that makes
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
sense any not and um good Stacy Stacy

04:01:42.990 --> 04:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
days good afternoon members of the
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative hle serving the
 
04:01:47.469 --> 04:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
towns of dun Barton hooks at Allenstown
 
04:01:47.479 --> 04:01:48.870 align:start position:0%
towns of dun Barton hooks at Allenstown
in

04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
Epsom I think this is my 10th year at
 
04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
the state house and I've never been
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
before this committee so this is a first
 
04:01:58.510 --> 04:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
um what started as a simple request grew
 
04:02:00.189 --> 04:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
into a multi-page
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
document I wish our Farms did as well as
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
OS did in drafting a very long document
 
04:02:08.590 --> 04:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
we would be have plentiful fruit and
 
04:02:11.349 --> 04:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
other Harvest this was simply a request
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
to repeal the requirement to pay $6 or
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
$7 every
 
04:02:19.950 --> 04:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
year um the email to them said let's get
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
rid of the dog
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
tax every year every dog owner in the
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
state has to pay a fee to keep their pet
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
we don't do this for other animals we do
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
this effectively for dogs only I
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
understand the need for rabies
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinations I get that that was part of
 
04:02:41.309 --> 04:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
the repeal that's not what I'm asking
 
04:02:43.149 --> 04:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
for I'm asking to get rid of the annual
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
fee dogs can be licensed once but
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's no need to continue to do this
 
04:02:50.429 --> 04:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
the pet owners and the veterinarians can
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
take care of the ensuring that the the
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are happening there's no
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
need to go print stamp email bills
 
04:02:58.680 --> 04:03:00.110 align:start position:0%
need to go print stamp email bills
around

04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
Etc every year to Chase down6 or
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
seven a better requirement would be to
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
require these to be licensed once that
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
license is good for the life of the dog
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
and let the dog owner and the
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian take care of the annual
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
shots that are necessary instead of
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
going through the trouble to have this
 
04:03:24.149 --> 04:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
fee come every
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
April um secondly I'm not sure how this
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
happened but outside agencies are the
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
one sending in the information to
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
collect these fees now this isn't coming
 
04:03:35.950 --> 04:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
directly from my town clerk um the town
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
clerks are working with other outside
 
04:03:40.149 --> 04:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
groups to do the billing for this in
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
violation of current law because this
 
04:03:43.510 --> 04:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
information should not be transmitted to
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
anybody else I don't care the people
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
know that I own a dog I've got pictures
 
04:03:49.910 --> 04:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
of my dog it's on Facebook it's on
 
04:03:53.070 --> 04:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
Twitter but our law says this
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
information should not be available to
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
other people um so there's clearly an
 
04:04:01.229 --> 04:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
issue there as well of personal privacy
 
04:04:04.149 --> 04:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
so what started is a simple request to
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate the six or I guess now $7 fee
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
every year turned into a multi-page
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
document I would ask that the document
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
that was turned in not be this was that
 
04:04:16.110 --> 04:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
whole OS Rush at the end of the filing
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
period where things were not getting
 
04:04:20.349 --> 04:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
done in time that we look at the bill
 
04:04:22.830 --> 04:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
simply to request to eliminate the
 
04:04:26.349 --> 04:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
requirement to re license a dog every
 
04:04:28.189 --> 04:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
year thank
 
04:04:32.550 --> 04:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
committee okay good representative
 
04:04:39.309 --> 04:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um do the
 
04:04:41.469 --> 04:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
fees that that are collected for dog
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
registration um fund anything dog
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
related in the towns or the for the
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
state they do fund things within the
 
04:04:49.359 --> 04:04:50.790 align:start position:0%
state they do fund things within the
state

04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a benefit to all the
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
citizens in the state not just the dog
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
owners right this should be funded out
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
of the general fund I sit on on the
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
finance committee a much better
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation would it be to make sure
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
those activities are funded by the
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
general population and not just those
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
dogs so
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
if you your suggestion is that we
 
04:05:19.630 --> 04:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
license the dog first you know one time
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
one time and then after that um they're
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
sort of on the honor System whether or
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
not they're going to vaccinate their dog
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
or not well the vet would presumably be
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
very interested in the health of the dog
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
the dog owner would be very interested
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the health of the dog everybody knows
 
04:05:40.590 --> 04:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
that if a dog gets rabies you're putting
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
the dog down so there's lots of reasons
 
04:05:44.910 --> 04:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
especially for dogs that spend any time
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
in the woods why you would go
 
04:05:50.429 --> 04:05:50.439 align:start position:0%
proactively get this done but I'm not
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
sure that requires government oversight
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
in all of this I think this is something
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
that could easily be managed between the
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and the individual pet
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
owner that's okay that's representative
 
04:06:06.510 --> 04:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
Murray question thank you madam chair um
 
04:06:08.110 --> 04:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to know whether or not you
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
did mention some Statewide efforts for
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
public benefit programs um but what
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
about local um vaccine clinics or
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
efforts like that part of the fee going
 
04:06:21.750 --> 04:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
to local efforts as well I I had one
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
person contact me and did some research
 
04:06:25.389 --> 04:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
where these fees were going I did not
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
look at all of that there might be
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
people in the audience who have a better
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of how we divvy up this
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
$7 I think the point
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
is why are we taxing one pet
 
04:06:41.070 --> 04:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
I like my dog Liberty's a great dog
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
great pet for the kids but this is not
 
04:06:46.429 --> 04:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
something I can understand the payment
 
04:06:48.269 --> 04:06:48.279 align:start position:0%
for getting the little stamp on the
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the little tag on the front
 
04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
putting it on their collar if they ever
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
get away all of that makes sense dogs
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
tend to roam more than cats for instance
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
but for instance I've seen cats that
 
04:07:01.469 --> 04:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
belong right no collar no nothing are
 
04:07:03.550 --> 04:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
out walking around between neighborhoods
 
04:07:05.070 --> 04:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
why aren't we doing the same for cats
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
now local we do allow local fness IP
 
04:07:11.269 --> 04:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
alties to do this by requiring that they
 
04:07:13.990 --> 04:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
have a tag and the tag be on them that
 
04:07:16.510 --> 04:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
helps us find the owner I'm okay with
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
that that's not the problem the problem
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
is we continue to pay this every year
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
and it's dis it's a fixed fee so it's
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionate in terms of the cost to
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
the lower inome
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
families I think we can do a single
 
04:07:35.229 --> 04:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
registration once and then leave the
 
04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the vaccination
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
between the owners and their
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
veterinarians representative H Haskins
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions I
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
have two I notice um that the animal
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
population control program would be
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
eliminated according to uh the
 
04:07:59.950 --> 04:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
department of well as I said the the
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
request in what came out of legislative
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
services are completely out of sync
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
starting on page five line 18 following
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
repeals an enormous number of stuff I
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
was simply asking to repeal the
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
requirement to have the license
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
annually but yet this is the bill that's
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
before us I I hear that and if you need
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
me to help draft an amendment that gets
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
rid of the annual requirement I can go
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
to LLS they were scrambling at the end
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the filing period to get all of this
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
in by a deadline and I don't know how
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
this came to be I agree I signed off
 
04:08:34.750 --> 04:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
because I had the option of signing off
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
or killing the bill and I signed it off
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
as is if you would like me to get an
 
04:08:40.670 --> 04:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that simply eliminates the
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
requirement to continue to re license
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
your dog in subsequent years I can get
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
that drafted for you followup if I may
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
followup yep um secondly I'm concerned
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing testimony about dogs
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
out of control and um people and animals
 
04:09:05.070 --> 04:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
being bitten and I wonder if you think
 
04:09:08.269 --> 04:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
that human behavior being what it is
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
that relying on owners to do the right
 
04:09:14.189 --> 04:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
thing and get their vaccinations and all
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
the rest is going to help the problem
 
04:09:20.349 --> 04:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
that we've been listening to here
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
today so I wasn't I apologize I was not
 
04:09:25.870 --> 04:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
here to hear all of the prior testimony
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
relative to dog biting and whatever um
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
most of the pet owners I know are very
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
responsible pet owner so I I don't
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily see that issue um I'm not
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
saying it does doesn't exist but from
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
where I stand um the groups of people
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
that I hang out with tend to be very
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
responsible adults and they take care of
 
04:09:47.950 --> 04:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
their pets and so part of this the issue
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
might be real I'm not saying it isn't I
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
don't know how big it is so I can't
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
speak to that thank you repres Bixby are
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
you aware that the uh amount of money
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the dog license that goes to the
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
municipality is there as insurance
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
against Damage Done by dogs that are
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
running loose uh if you say so I believe
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
that could be the case thank you
 
04:10:11.080 --> 04:10:16.910 align:start position:0%
that could be the case thank you
representative

04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.469 --> 04:10:19.479 align:start position:0%

04:10:21.149 --> 04:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
gonna ask I apologize problem all right

04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
license where is there in the bill what
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
the charge would be um for a one-time
 
04:10:41.149 --> 04:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
license and and how would that be done I
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
would leave the charge at the $7 for the
 
04:10:43.080 --> 04:10:44.109 align:start position:0%
would leave the charge at the $7 for the
initial

04:10:44.109 --> 04:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
initial
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
license and for the life of the dog for
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
the life of the dog that means that we
 
04:10:50.109 --> 04:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
have to come up with the other money
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
that is then was was generated in Prior
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
years with the annual license via
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
something through the state budget
 
04:11:01.630 --> 04:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
followup followup okay uh are are you
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
aware that several years ago we had a
 
04:11:07.510 --> 04:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill um to raise the dog license fee
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
from $5 to
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
$5.50 a year uh and that was going to
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
fund an animal abuse fund um for for
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that um look the other
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
way on animal abuse because they
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to take care of the
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
animals and that was voted down uh one
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
penny a week less than a penny a week uh
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
because as we all know death are taxes
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand if the legislature
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to fund one penny a week how
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to get I don't know a half a
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars out of the general fund
 
04:11:48.070 --> 04:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
so so I may not have been in at that
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
point but there is a difference between
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
demanding that the dog owners pay 50
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
cents more and funding the necessary
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
item right I think you're conflicting G
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
the generation of Revenue and how and
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
where it's spent there's lots of ways
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
that we can tax the citizen
 
04:12:09.790 --> 04:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
the dog owners tend to be a little bit
 
04:12:12.349 --> 04:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
upset about continuing to have the dogs
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
be taxed so that 50 c increase was real
 
04:12:18.030 --> 04:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
it was a 10% increase and that's
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
probably why it was voted down there's
 
04:12:23.790 --> 04:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
no reason why in our six plus billion
 
04:12:28.109 --> 04:12:28.119 align:start position:0%
doll annual budget we can't find the
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
$500,000 or whatever the final number is
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
to fund some of these things it does
 
04:12:38.109 --> 04:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
benefit every citizen across the state
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think the dog owner should be
 
04:12:43.710 --> 04:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:47.189 --> 04:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
burden representive Howard apologies for
 
04:12:50.149 --> 04:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
that little glitch um I I I don't have a
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
dog and I haven't registered a dog in a
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
long time so I I might be off a little
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
bit on this but is the the fact that the
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
dog got the rabies shot attached to
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
their record and if they um to their
 
04:13:05.710 --> 04:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
registration so when you have when we do
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
it annually is it do we get the shot and
 
04:13:10.510 --> 04:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
then we go register the dog yeah you get
 
04:13:13.790 --> 04:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
the shot you register the dog the that
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
latest stamped collar shows that you've
 
04:13:19.590 --> 04:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
T you've gone to the trouble to go to
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
your vet get your vet record sent to
 
04:13:24.030 --> 04:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
your clerk have your clerk issue a tag
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
and then put the tag on that's what that
 
04:13:29.229 --> 04:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
shows evidence of follow
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
up followup so um is there a way if we
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
were to register the dog once is there a
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
way to attach the rabies Rec records to
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
that one registration so that so that if
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
someone were to find your dog and um and
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
look him up or somehow would know that
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
he was um that he was up to date on his
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so I don't believe those
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
records are online right now they might
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
be um I don't believe you can go look up
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
a dog ID and figure out whether it's
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not I think this
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately comes down to contacting the
 
04:14:06.750 --> 04:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
owner and or the Town Clerk and or the
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
vet that's tied to that record I don't
 
04:14:10.710 --> 04:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
believe there's any reason we couldn't
 
04:14:12.950 --> 04:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
have the dog tag that has a number and
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
that information be available that says
 
04:14:19.510 --> 04:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
this dog's name is X or her name is X
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that that information ties to a vet
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
that was at the time of registration
 
04:14:27.109 --> 04:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
contact this vet now that vet may not be
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
the current vet I get it but at the time
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the dog was registered they Ed the
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
H hooks at veterinarian clinic and from
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
there that person can say I know who the
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
owner is we'll contact them there's a
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of ways to look up that
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
information I don't know that this
 
04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
requires the fee to be to every every
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
year representative Murray thank you
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair um are there circumstances
 
04:14:54.149 --> 04:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
in which a perhaps maybe a law
 
04:14:56.830 --> 04:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer or um somebody else
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
would come to the town hall and ask for
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
proof of registration and vaccine um in
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
the event of there being an issue and
 
04:15:07.870 --> 04:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
some of so stop there and then I have a
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
followup so I believe this information
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
is not to be shared is my understanding
 
04:15:15.070 --> 04:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
I believe a police officer doing their
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
line of duty might need to get access to
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
that information as well um if they
 
04:15:22.510 --> 04:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
found a dog for instance they may have
 
04:15:24.429 --> 04:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
called The Town Clerk and say I have dog
 
04:15:27.790 --> 04:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
that has license whatever 1 two-
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
367 um can you tell me who the owner is
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
so I can get the dog
 
04:15:33.080 --> 04:15:34.830 align:start position:0%
so I can get the dog
returned

04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
returned
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
followup and there is there not another
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance in which maybe the dog has
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
bitten somebody and they are trying to
 
04:15:45.910 --> 04:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
discern whether or not the animal has is
 
04:15:48.030 --> 04:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
up to date or has been vaccinated AB
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely and if there's a tag on the
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
dog we can trace down back to the owner
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
Andor to the to the
 
04:15:55.920 --> 04:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
Andor to the to the
veterinarian

04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
04:16:00.149 --> 04:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
um and find out whether that record is
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
accurate there's no reason we have to
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
force the owners to continue to get
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
these tags and put the tag on the dogs
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
compliance any other questions from the
 
04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you
 
04:16:19.510 --> 04:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative hall for presenting this
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
bill and I would call Stacy
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
speak good
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you chair Aon members of
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
the committee Stacy oer with the
 
04:16:43.109 --> 04:16:43.119 align:start position:0%
American Kennel Club and um wanted to
 
04:16:47.109 --> 04:16:47.119 align:start position:0%
just go on record and say that AKC is a
 
04:16:49.550 --> 04:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
believes it's important that responsible
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
ownership tools be preserved such as dog
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
licenses and we don't support repealing
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
the requirement that dogs be registered
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
annually um in addition to the funding
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions that have been proposed you
 
04:17:09.109 --> 04:17:09.119 align:start position:0%
know the function of the dog license
 
04:17:12.269 --> 04:17:12.279 align:start position:0%
includes um following for instance a
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
change of ownership so by virtue of
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
having to
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
annually register in town There's a um
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
insurance so to speak that the dog is on
 
04:17:27.790 --> 04:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
record with the town or if a dog is
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
deceased then you would know okay this
 
04:17:32.950 --> 04:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
dog is no longer in town or where it
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
resides in the event there's a fire and
 
04:17:37.710 --> 04:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
fire department's respond how many dogs
 
04:17:39.990 --> 04:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
are in the in the house there's there's
 
04:17:44.109 --> 04:17:44.119 align:start position:0%
a desire to have that accurate count um
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
and as I was listening to testimony uh
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor with regard to whether
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
or not there's a need after your first
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
registration um in the event you had
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
let's say a serious injury from a dog
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
attack or maybe a dog that bit and for
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
some reason wasn't up to date on its
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
rabies for instance um my experience
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
with some of these horrible incidences
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
are that owners are not necessarily
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
forthcoming in that type of a scenario
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
to say yes I am the owner uh there was
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
an attack of a dog in Maine for instance
 
04:18:24.269 --> 04:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
and that owner took off of from the site
 
04:18:26.590 --> 04:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh rather than take responsibility for
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
their dog and for the situation so I do
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
think there is value in having an annual
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
dog license and ensuring that it's
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
accurate and up to date for the town um
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
in addition to you know a Veterinary
 
04:18:41.469 --> 04:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
practice not being open or available and
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to ensure that the rabies
 
04:18:46.429 --> 04:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine which typically expires every
 
04:18:49.149 --> 04:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
three years and you have to renew it is
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
just part of responsible dog ownership
 
04:18:53.710 --> 04:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
and a valuable tool so we support um
 
04:18:55.109 --> 04:18:55.119 align:start position:0%
keeping it in
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
place thank you represent viby so uh we
 
04:19:01.950 --> 04:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
just heard a bill um this morning about
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
vicious dog attacks uh does the
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement uh help in uh um
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
preventing uh bringing um those who are
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for vicious dogs to just to
 
04:19:19.469 --> 04:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
Justice to make sure that they uh appr
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately restrain their dogs in the
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
future and uh are responsible for the
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
dogs ownership well I just think the dog
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
license because it's current is a uh
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
confirmation of who the current owner is
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
and that's a valuable uh piece of
 
04:19:38.349 --> 04:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
information in the event of yes an
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
attack like that or if there was a
 
04:19:42.109 --> 04:19:42.119 align:start position:0%
vicious dog that um had been labeled
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that way you would certainly want to
 
04:19:46.429 --> 04:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
know who the owner was and have that
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
accurate record um and to be certain it
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
hadn't been you know transferred to
 
04:19:53.870 --> 04:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
somebody else for
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
instance okay thank you representative
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair would you
 
04:20:00.990 --> 04:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
um also say that there's a public health
 
04:20:05.309 --> 04:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
benefit to the fee um to ensuring um
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
that there's an opportunity for um the
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
public to receive uh local vaccine
 
04:20:12.630 --> 04:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
clinics if there are any and other
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
services around um the health and
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
well-being of
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
animals yeah I know I know that um dog
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
license fees have been typically used
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
for um can be used for animal control uh
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
training they can be used for spay
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
neuter programs I think uh New Hampshire
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
dogs who will be testifying after me on
 
04:20:35.070 --> 04:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
the bill probably provide you with the
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
details relative to how that money is
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
used from a public safety standpoint
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:20:42.910 --> 04:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any other
 
04:20:45.389 --> 04:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.239 --> 04:20:56.349 align:start position:0%
 
Olsen

04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
Olsen
 
04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
hi put your microphone on just press
 
04:21:02.670 --> 04:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
button there you go hello yep okay
 
04:21:02.680 --> 04:21:04.309 align:start position:0%
button there you go hello yep okay
thanks

04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:21:07.109 --> 04:21:07.119 align:start position:0%
um aside from finding it generally
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
objectionable that I should need a
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
license to have a dog or get taxed to
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
have a dog uh I think practically
 
04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
speaking this is
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
counterproductive um the the only reason
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
that my town knows that I have a dog is
 
04:21:22.269 --> 04:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
because I brought my dog in to get a RAB
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
shot that's the point at which they
 
04:21:26.429 --> 04:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
gather that information and give it to
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
the town um if I value my privacy and or
 
04:21:32.590 --> 04:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay the fee or don't want
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
to have to go in and deal with the town
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
on this matter the only way I can avoid
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
that is to not get the rabies shot this
 
04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
is an incentive to not get it it I don't
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
see how this would in any way encourage
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
people to get it uh all they would end
 
04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
up doing is paying more tax um as far as
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
keeping track of people track of owner
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
track of whether or not the dog has
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
rabies that's what the little tags on
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
the dog do um if you are responsible
 
04:22:03.910 --> 04:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
enough to get a shot and put a tag and
 
04:22:05.269 --> 04:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
put your phone number in contact
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
information on your animal people are
 
04:22:07.990 --> 04:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find you and know
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
that it got a shot and know when and by
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
what doctor um if you're not responsible
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
to do that and you don't put a tag on
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to know that information
 
04:22:18.269 --> 04:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
whether you paid a license fee or not
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
because they're not going to know whose
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
dog it is to look up that license um so
 
04:22:26.750 --> 04:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
this entire thing seems kind of
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
counterproductive um I would also
 
04:22:32.149 --> 04:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
question how worthwhile Gathering funds
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
in this manner is you're Gathering you
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
know what six or seven dollars uh you
 
04:22:38.510 --> 04:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
have the staff of the hospital going and
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
recording this information relaying it
 
04:22:41.830 --> 04:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
to the town the town is recording it
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
then the town sending me out a letter um
 
04:22:45.870 --> 04:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
telling me that I have to come in and
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
write a check for this $6 you know how
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
many people's time effort and postage is
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
wasted collecting
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
$7 uh this just seems like a really
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
ineffective way to I mean couldn't uh
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't some other tax just be $7
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
higher um that's all
 
04:23:07.870 --> 04:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
thanks question I just have
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
clarification oh yeah um thank you I'm
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
also acting as clerk today so if you uh
 
04:23:14.109 --> 04:23:14.119 align:start position:0%
would mind are you here representing
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
yourself or or another organization or
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
just myself okay thank you
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
representative du
 
04:23:23.229 --> 04:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you thank you for taking your
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
right question so if $7 and I agree you
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
know it's a little bit of money uh what
 
04:23:31.469 --> 04:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
if we did an average age of a dog let's
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
say 13 years and we multiplied that by
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
seven and so it was a one-time fee of
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
let me do it in my head what's that $91
 
04:23:43.309 --> 04:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
a year uh would that be preferable to
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
you I I would object to any kind of a
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
dog license or fee I don't really think
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's the town's business whether or not
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
I have a dog um and as far as like
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
tracking for liability or anything I
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
people are already liable and and held
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for what their pets
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
do so if can I have one followup sure so
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I assume you're also against driver's
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
licenses because that involves a fee and
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
you're also against uh registra auto
 
04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
registration fees because that involves
 
04:24:18.510 --> 04:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
I mean you know auto registration is
 
04:24:21.030 --> 04:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
annual I think a license is every five
 
04:24:23.630 --> 04:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
years so you would be against that
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
also I don't see what that has those are
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
completely different things you're
 
04:24:29.550 --> 04:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
actually interacting with other people
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
on the road and there's a whole bunch of
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
other stuff that goes into driver's
 
04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
licenses and we use them for all kinds
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
of other things
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
um you know you could make all kinds of
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
arguments about that but I don't see how
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
they're really relevant to this this
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
specific license doesn't seem to
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
um okay so um so then you would be fine
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
with your dog not having any kind of tag
 
04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
and if it got loose and then bit
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
somebody then there would be no way for
 
04:25:10.030 --> 04:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
Animal Control who caught your dog to
 
04:25:13.149 --> 04:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
trace the dog back to you no of course
 
04:25:15.670 --> 04:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
not my dog has tags and had tags long
 
04:25:17.469 --> 04:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
before the town knew I had a dog and
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
assessed me a fee for it uh my dog has
 
04:25:22.750 --> 04:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
my address my phone number as well as
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
the rabies tags and show when and where
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
that that rabies vaccine was given um I
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely want people to know that it's
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
my dog and return it to me and let me
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
know what's going on with it if anything
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
should happen or if she got away um and
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
I think I would expect that to be nearly
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
Universal amongst people who own dogs um
 
04:25:45.910 --> 04:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't think this is a problem and I
 
04:25:47.950 --> 04:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know of this being a problem in
 
04:25:51.109 --> 04:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
places where they don't have dog
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
licenses so you're you're assuming that
 
04:25:57.870 --> 04:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
everybody is going to follow the same
 
04:26:00.910 --> 04:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
protocol that you do if if they didn't
 
04:26:04.830 --> 04:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
have to get a rabies vaccine and get
 
04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
tags um um what if they decided they
 
04:26:10.750 --> 04:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to put any tags on their dog
 
04:26:13.149 --> 04:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
and the dog gets out and bites somebody
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's no way to trace the animal back
 
04:26:18.870 --> 04:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the owner and find out whether or not
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
the dog was vaccinated or who owns it or
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
whatever uh yes but that's true whether
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
or not there's a fee in fact the the fee
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
we want all the dogs to get their Raby
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
shots I do I want my dog to have a Raby
 
04:26:33.870 --> 04:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
shot I want the other dogs to have a
 
04:26:36.229 --> 04:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
Raby shot and I want people to know that
 
04:26:38.429 --> 04:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
and see it on the tag uh but by
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
attaching a fee and an extra process to
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
it and you know you have the personal
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
information and privacy issue by adding
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
all of this extra stuff you're
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
disincentivizing people from doing that
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
um you know am I more or less likely to
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
want to go in and get the rabies shot if
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
I know I'm going to be harassed by the
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
town and charged a fee for doing it how
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
how would that encourage me to get the
 
04:27:01.510 --> 04:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
rabies shot how is it going to encourage
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
other dog owners to get the Raby shot
 
04:27:05.309 --> 04:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm going to get it anyway
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
because it's an important thing to do um
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't think it seems to me that
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the uh the stated intention of this
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
is is not really aligned with actually
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
achieving that goal it seems like it's
 
04:27:23.469 --> 04:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
doing the opposite to me okay any other
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:27:27.469 --> 04:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you for coming
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
in speaking with us this
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:54.309 align:start position:0%
 
Holmes

04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again for the record my
 
04:27:59.309 --> 04:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
name is Nancy Holmes I'm up here today
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
from New Boston I want to talk about
 
04:28:03.870 --> 04:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
what a good thing it is to have dogs
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
licensed in this state
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
um our dog licensing program is
 
04:28:11.389 --> 04:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
important beyond the recovery of lost or
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
stray pets which is also
 
04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
important a little closer to me okay I
 
04:28:20.429 --> 04:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
thought you might be tired of
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
me um because we license our dogs New
 
04:28:25.149 --> 04:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of the few states that
 
04:28:27.750 --> 04:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
has vastly reduced the production of
 
04:28:30.429 --> 04:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
unexpected unwanted and unplanned
 
04:28:33.070 --> 04:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
litters by portions of the fee funding
 
04:28:36.910 --> 04:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
our spay neuter fund our dog linging
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
also helps fund the Diagnostics lab and
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
within our towns money uh money from um
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
the tag goes into our town coffers to
 
04:28:51.389 --> 04:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
help pay for animal control issues um
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
and I believe somebody mentioned that it
 
04:28:57.790 --> 04:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
goes into um helping handle the the cost
 
04:29:00.189 --> 04:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
of a of a dog causing
 
04:29:00.199 --> 04:29:01.790 align:start position:0%
of a of a dog causing
damages

04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
damages
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
um so it would actually H because
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
um getting a license is proof of current
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine our pets and their owners
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
are safer I Want You cast your minds
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
back to when this bill happened that the
 
04:29:19.760 --> 04:29:21.269 align:start position:0%
back to when this bill happened that the
rabies

04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
rabies
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine and dog licensing were tied
 
04:29:28.149 --> 04:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
together the reason this was done is
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
because people were not vaccinating
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
their pets against rabies and it was
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
determined that this was an extremely
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
important thing to have done because we
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
do have rabies in New Hampshire so that
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
there was there was a reason behind that
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
whole connection um and it's now I think
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's electronic now that the information
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
goes from the vet to most of the towns
 
04:29:52.750 --> 04:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
and they just have it online to handle
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
to when you come in to license your pet
 
04:30:00.910 --> 04:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
um that long list of rsas that would be
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
cancelled that's the list of unintended
 
04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
consequences you know everybody's wentw
 
04:30:09.630 --> 04:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
why is this long list of ours because
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
that's what would H that's what would no
 
04:30:13.870 --> 04:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
longer be needed or would no longer be
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
able to happen if you take away the dog
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
licensing fee um trying think there
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
anything else that I had here for you oh
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
if anybody's town has a dog tag that
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
actually lasts for an entire year on
 
04:30:33.109 --> 04:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
their dog I am so jealous I can't
 
04:30:36.109 --> 04:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
imagine one that or the cost one that
 
04:30:37.990 --> 04:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
would actually last for the lifetime of
 
04:30:41.070 --> 04:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
a dog I haven't had it I mean I bought a
 
04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
absolute dog proof guarantee to keep the
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
um tag on the dog's collar from a dog
 
04:30:51.229 --> 04:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
supply catalog and both my dogs remove
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
them from their collars within about a
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
half an hour of having the tags attached
 
04:30:57.309 --> 04:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm jealous if somebody's got tags
 
04:30:59.510 --> 04:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
that actually stay on that that that's
 
04:31:02.469 --> 04:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
interesting um but you know I I think
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
that we're that the law as it stands
 
04:31:08.189 --> 04:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
particularly with the rise in people who
 
04:31:12.030 --> 04:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
are against vaccinations of any type um
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
I think the law as it stands really
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
protects our pets and our people um from
 
04:31:21.910 --> 04:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
the dangers of rabies and that the yeah
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
the dog owners shoulder the burden of
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
things like the spay neuter fund and the
 
04:31:28.990 --> 04:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
Diagnostics left that all animals
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from but there absolutely
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
nothing preventing towns except the
 
04:31:37.269 --> 04:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
outcry um from having the same thing
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
done for cats um but I think right now
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
with just the dog's contributions we're
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
doing an awful lot of good in this state
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be a shame to end
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
that just because somebody finds it too
 
04:31:53.109 --> 04:31:53.119 align:start position:0%
difficult to write a small check to
 
04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
their town to get a license for their
 
04:31:59.309 --> 04:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
dog be happy to answer any questions any
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:32:05.149 --> 04:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you and I
 
04:32:07.630 --> 04:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
call Angela
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
dogs one I I seriously hope that the
 
04:32:17.389 --> 04:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
stuff I submitted through the portal
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
actually gets to
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
you I'm looking at it now oh good like
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.429 --> 04:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
paper all right good afternoon Angela
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
Ferrari dog owners of the Granite State
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
um here to talk a little bit about
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
repealing the requirement to register
 
04:32:41.189 --> 04:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
dogs annually and dive into a little bit
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the facts behind some of the funds
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we have um dog owners does oppose
 
04:32:51.389 --> 04:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
this bill but the animal population
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
control fund or program I should say um
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
contributes extensively to as Nancy
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned the prevention of having one
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
stray animals due to unwanted litters
 
04:33:06.269 --> 04:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
04:33:09.070 --> 04:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
um and that fund has done such a great
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
job over the years that we've actually
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
had to start bringing in animals from
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
other states to provide um the or to
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
support the demands of what people want
 
04:33:24.189 --> 04:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
for dogs and cats in our state also we
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
recently had a bill which you probably
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
remember that transferred some of the
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
money from the uh animal population
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
control program to our New Hampshire
 
04:33:37.390 --> 04:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
veterinary diagnostic laboratory fund um
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
because we did have a a surplus in there
 
04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
due to how well that bill has or that
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
program has done and th both of those
 
04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
are funded by the licenses that are
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
received annually from dog licenses um
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
in general it's a little over a million
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
dollars that comes in annually to the
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire from those fees
 
04:34:00.269 --> 04:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
from the licenses and gets dispersed
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
into the various funds including what
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
the uh municipalities get as small
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
portion of that fee for their
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
administrative duties and then
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
additionally any money that would go
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
into their general fund the New
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinary diagnostic
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
laboratory uh would lose around
 
04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
$95,000 of that annually um and that's a
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
really important program that we have um
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
currently that a diagnostic laboratory
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
is studying the respiratory illness that
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
you've likely heard about in New
 
04:34:36.070 --> 04:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's been affecting a lot of
 
04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
dogs not just in New Hampshire out of
 
04:34:41.310 --> 04:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
the state as well but New Hampshire um
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
and that lab is one of the places that
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
is collecting samples from around the
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
country um to try to determine what the
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
cause of that illness is and what we can
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
do to resolve that um so the those are
 
04:34:59.949 --> 04:34:59.959 align:start position:0%
just a few of the impacts that removing
 
04:35:03.310 --> 04:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
this license fee could have knowing that
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
we would still get the license fee for
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
you know the first year of the dog we
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
know we would see a significant drop in
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
the funds available for these different
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
programs um as you've heard you know in
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
regards to rabies itself huge public
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
safety concerns if there isn't that
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
tracking mechanism to ensure people are
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
getting the dogs their Raby vaccines um
 
04:35:31.629 --> 04:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
in years past and even coming up next
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about how do
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
we reduce educe what is required to get
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
a rabies vaccine or allowing exemptions
 
04:35:43.230 --> 04:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
on rabies vaccines we've heard bills
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
about not getting rabies vaccines with
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
the ability to tighter for rabies which
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
is something we can do for other
 
04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
diseases but isn't approved yet in the
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
United States for rabies so whether you
 
04:35:58.709 --> 04:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
know we want to allow citizens to say
 
04:36:01.230 --> 04:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do it I promise we know
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
that there's already a drive towards how
 
04:36:06.910 --> 04:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
can we reduce ruce the amount of rabies
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines we're putting into our dogs so
 
04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
if we are taking away the annual process
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's ensuring that those vaccines are
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
happening we are going to be opening up
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
the ability for people to avoid those
 
04:36:22.990 --> 04:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines even more so than what we're
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
seeing them try to do today now I
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
understand that a lot of it has to do
 
04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
with how do we save the individual dog
 
04:36:33.429 --> 04:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
owner some money $7 a year maybe you
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
have a couple dogs it starts to add up
 
04:36:38.590 --> 04:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
am I excited to pay my dogs licensing
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
bills every year no um but I still do it
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
I know it's going to my town which I
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
appreciate the town that I live in and
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
what they do for us that money isn't
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to just disappear it's going to
 
04:36:55.709 --> 04:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
get repurposed or not repurposed but
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to receive that bill in
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
another form if we're moving it from the
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
municipality over to the veterinarian
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
well now they have to start tracking
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
which dogs have their licenses uh or had
 
04:37:10.109 --> 04:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
their rabies vaccines when they're due
 
04:37:11.949 --> 04:37:11.959 align:start position:0%
they have to start making communication
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the people and make sure that the
 
04:37:16.189 --> 04:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
dogs are receiving the vaccines and
 
04:37:18.029 --> 04:37:18.039 align:start position:0%
doing that tracking mechanism that the
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
towns are currently doing guarantee
 
04:37:22.269 --> 04:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to see an increase in the
 
04:37:24.629 --> 04:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
cost of that rabies vaccine through your
 
04:37:27.230 --> 04:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarian so do we want to take it
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
away from the town so it feels like
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
you're not spending $7 transfer it to
 
04:37:32.240 --> 04:37:33.070 align:start position:0%
you're not spending $7 transfer it to
the

04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um where you're still going
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
to to get that fee in one way or
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
another and then people can just
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
transfer vets as a means to avoid that
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
you can ignore your vet but can you
 
04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
ignore your town clerk who's going to
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
send the Animal control officer to your
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
house if you have not let them know that
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
your dog died or paid your license fee
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
with proof of rabies vaccine I usually
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
find out from my town that my dog's
 
04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine is coming up on its
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
expiration date and I say oh okay Raley
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
is going to need his rabes vaccine this
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
year I'm going to get him into the Vet
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
so that when I license him I can provide
 
04:38:17.629 --> 04:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
that to them and I don't have to have
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
them chase me down for it um so those
 
04:38:24.830 --> 04:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
are a few of the things um I'm trying to
 
04:38:26.869 --> 04:38:26.879 align:start position:0%
think if there was anything else oh one
 
04:38:28.470 --> 04:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
of the other things going back to public
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
safety concerns if somebody does get bit
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
by a dog and it can't be proven that
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
that dog has had its rabies vaccine it
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
can cost upwards of $4,000 per person
 
04:38:41.949 --> 04:38:41.959 align:start position:0%
just to go through the medical treatment
 
04:38:44.510 --> 04:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that they aren't going to
 
04:38:48.269 --> 04:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
get rabies from a dog who may or may not
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
have had its vaccine um so there's
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
definitely extending costs that could
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
come of this um and I think that pretty
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
much covers everything that I had but I
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
would be up for any questions thank you
 
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so um my question is do you you see
 
04:39:05.680 --> 04:39:08.310 align:start position:0%
yeah so um my question is do you you see
that

04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
um instead of some people call this a
 
04:39:11.840 --> 04:39:12.910 align:start position:0%
um instead of some people call this a
dog

04:39:12.910 --> 04:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
dog
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
tax do you consider it more of a user
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
fee I mean in that in so far as if if
 
04:39:21.949 --> 04:39:21.959 align:start position:0%
you weren't paying your $7 a year for
 
04:39:21.959 --> 04:39:22.750 align:start position:0%
you weren't paying your $7 a year for
your

04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
dog that some of these
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
other um the Diagnostic lab and some of
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
the other things that are funded by the
 
04:39:37.628 --> 04:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
dog license in fee would then have to be
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
borne by um the general fund the rest of
 
04:39:45.628 --> 04:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers in the in the state so
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
would you consider this to be more of a
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
user fee since you have a dog and you
 
04:39:52.510 --> 04:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
have interest in um the the operation of
 
04:39:54.708 --> 04:39:54.718 align:start position:0%
the lab and and that kind of thing going
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
on in the state yeah I could definitely
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
see it as more of a a user fee also as
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
soon as we start asking all of the dog o
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
non dog owners to approve monies coming
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to go into things
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
that aren't important to them such as
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
the animal population control or the
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
Diagnostic lab we may start receiving
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
push back and therefore the general fund
 
04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
may not be able to fund those programs
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
any longer um so if that's going to be
 
04:40:29.788 --> 04:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
something that is part of having a dog I
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
think it would be only fair thank you uh
 
04:40:35.830 --> 04:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:40:37.708 --> 04:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh is there anyone else
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
I have no more ping cards is there
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
anyone else who's interested in speaking
 
04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
for or against the spill seeing none
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for getting the blue sheet
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Duty and the online
 
04:40:56.948 --> 04:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
portal where people have been submitting
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
their testimony we have two people in
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
support of hp1501 and 22 opposed
 
04:41:07.868 --> 04:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
with one
 
04:41:12.190 --> 04:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
neutral and then on our blue sheet we
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
have uh three people opposed to
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
h501 and with that I'm going to close
 
04:41:22.270 --> 04:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
out the hearing and
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
hp1501 and I will open up the hearing
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
for HB
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
1556 which is relative to exemptions
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
from the rabies vaccine and here to
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
introduce that bill to us is
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%

County and I'm here to introduce House
 
04:42:00.718 --> 04:42:02.868 align:start position:0%
County and I'm here to introduce House
Bill

04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
1556 um it is rabies related but it's a
 
04:42:07.708 --> 04:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
lot different than the previous bill I
 
04:42:10.110 --> 04:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
think that you heard and I I'll just set
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
up uh my understanding of this um this
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
bill is a constituent
 
04:42:16.990 --> 04:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
request uh and that constituent is here
 
04:42:19.910 --> 04:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll present testimony so um
 
04:42:22.430 --> 04:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
we'll keep that in mind uh this section
 
04:42:27.070 --> 04:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
of law was uh tweaked I think last year
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
and so this would be an additional tweak
 
04:42:34.110 --> 04:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
um this has to do with dogs that are
 
04:42:34.120 --> 04:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
um this has to do with dogs that are
sick

04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
sick
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
and in a health condition
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
where uh vaccination may may compromise
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
their health condition further so that's
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the narrow area that we're focused
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
on so these are old dogs or dogs with
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
immune uh compromis conditions uh who H
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
who get an exemption from the rabies
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
shot so they they are Exempted from it
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
but current statute requires the OWN to
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
treat the dog as if it has rabies so
 
04:43:10.948 --> 04:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
these old and sickly dogs have to walk
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
around with a muzzle when whenever they
 
04:43:16.190 --> 04:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
go outside uh that's really the the key
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
um area that we would like to to tweak I
 
04:43:24.390 --> 04:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
believe um so there's some uh there's
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
some misunderstanding I think about how
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
this bill would affect uh wildlife and
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture that it's a it's it's
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
narrowly focused to dogs that are sickly
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
and they already have an exemption from
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
the rabies vaccine they would still have
 
04:43:40.990 --> 04:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
to be leashed and under the physical
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
Direct Control of the owner but they
 
04:43:44.750 --> 04:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from having to wear a
 
04:43:47.830 --> 04:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
muzzle uh when they're outside on a hot
 
04:43:53.070 --> 04:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
July August day um for example um it
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
does strict some things about having the
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions signed by the American
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
College of Veterinary and Internal
 
04:44:04.030 --> 04:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
Medicine a diplomate from that and also
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um and we can we can talk
 
04:44:10.430 --> 04:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
about you know whether that's uh the
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
best approach or not so I'll leave this
 
04:44:14.510 --> 04:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
bill to the committee in the good hands
 
04:44:16.350 --> 04:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee and I'd be happy to
 
04:44:18.910 --> 04:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
work with you if you find any uh things
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
that need to be tweaked um and I will
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
point out is it is a bipartisan Bill uh
 
04:44:25.830 --> 04:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs and myself are
 
04:44:25.840 --> 04:44:26.910 align:start position:0%
representative buroughs and myself are
both

04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
both
 
04:44:28.830 --> 04:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors all right without take any
 
04:44:31.470 --> 04:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay so what I'm seeing is
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
then uh we would be striking out the
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
recommendation signed by the American
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
College of Veterinary Internal Medicine
 
04:44:41.230 --> 04:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
Diplomat diplomate and the state
 
04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and we would also
 
04:44:47.390 --> 04:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:44:49.868 --> 04:44:49.878 align:start position:0%
um the Exempted animal shall be
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
maintained in strict rabies isolation
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
under conditions that are at the
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
discretion of the local rabies control
 
04:44:58.350 --> 04:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
Authority until such time as medical
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
condition has been resolved and the
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
animal can be immunized so that's
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
stricken as well as when the animal's
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
Outdoors it shall be
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
muzzled uh in a manner approved by the
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
local rabies control Authority so those
 
04:45:15.310 --> 04:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
three parts are stricken from um the
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccination
 
04:45:20.670 --> 04:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
exemption so I'm just making that clear
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's a correct reading of the the bill
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay good enough thanks yeah and just
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate the these dogs don't
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
have rabies and they have an exemption
 
04:45:30.670 --> 04:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine but they're being
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
treated as if they have rabies right
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the right because
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
normally when uh say a dog has um
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
horrible reaction to rabies vaccine um
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
and the owner doesn't want to put their
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
dog through uh getting those kinds of
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
reactions they can apply for an
 
04:45:53.470 --> 04:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
exemption for the
 
04:45:55.708 --> 04:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
animal but then they haven't had the
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine so they are then um you
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
know it's possible that they could be
 
04:46:02.160 --> 04:46:03.190 align:start position:0%
know it's possible that they could be
carrying

04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
carrying
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:05.110 align:start position:0%
carrying
rabies

04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
rabies
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray thank you madam
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
question um I appreciate you being
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
before the committee um are you aware of
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
there being a way to determine whether
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
or not aside from physical appearance
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
and symptoms that may outwardly present
 
04:46:23.510 --> 04:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
themselves in an animal's disposition uh
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
if they were to contract rabies are you
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
aware of another way of determining that
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
while the animal is still living I I'm
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
not an expert so I I don't know I'd
 
04:46:33.750 --> 04:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
imagine that there probably are tests
 
04:46:35.470 --> 04:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
the animal animal doesn't go outside on
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
its own so it's it's always under the uh
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
under the uh control of the owner so
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
there is oversight um not not to be glit
 
04:46:47.190 --> 04:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
but I could have rabes right like uh you
 
04:46:49.510 --> 04:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
know it's a it's a thing that we can all
 
04:46:52.030 --> 04:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
get um and we just have to keep track of
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
our contact with Wildlife or other
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
things that you know lead to that Vector
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
of disease so represent Murray um thank
 
04:47:01.150 --> 04:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
you for the followup I guess so my
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
question is then um your request is to
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
strike the the muzzle requirements and
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
if an animal is out and about in the
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
public so not just in the home so my
 
04:47:13.270 --> 04:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
question is if an animal were to come in
 
04:47:16.590 --> 04:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
contact um who was unvaccinated and
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
potentially had you know come into
 
04:47:22.510 --> 04:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
contact with another animal or you know
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
been exposed to rabies in some other way
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
is there a concern that there might
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
possibly be an interaction and where
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
rabies could be trans it's a very remote
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
possibility from just the way that I you
 
04:47:35.788 --> 04:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
know imag imagine how things would go um
 
04:47:37.548 --> 04:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
I am a dog owner I've had dogs that were
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
sickly and you know that that at the end
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
of their life we try to make them as
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable as possible
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay representative Duty
 
04:47:50.590 --> 04:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair I don't know
 
04:47:52.628 --> 04:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
if you know the answer to this question
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
but uh you know last year we did do the
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
exemption for ant um dogs that have a
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
reaction so if we strike out uh some of
 
04:48:06.430 --> 04:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
these Clauses here will that affect
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
those animals also um because a lot of
 
04:48:12.270 --> 04:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
them are younger stronger animals but
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
they have a reaction so they wouldn't
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
have to be muzzled either uh because
 
04:48:20.590 --> 04:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a concern would this Bill
 
04:48:23.708 --> 04:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
affect um the requirements that we've
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
set for those animals so it would apply
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
to any uh dog that got that has this
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
exemption right and and just just to
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
reiterate the leash requirement is still
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
in there it's just the muzzle
 
04:48:40.230 --> 04:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that would be removed for
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
for those
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
dos okay any
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby yeah so
 
04:48:51.310 --> 04:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that um it was just
 
04:48:55.470 --> 04:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
last year that we uh changed the law
 
04:48:59.230 --> 04:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
from requiring the uh the signature of
 
04:49:01.390 --> 04:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
the American College of veterinarian
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
inter and internal medicine diplomate
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the state veterinarian uh beyond the
 
04:49:10.830 --> 04:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
first granting of the exemption so now
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
they those two signatures are only
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
needed when the exemption is first
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
granted any uh and that's something that
 
04:49:22.548 --> 04:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
we we just put into into while last
 
04:49:25.548 --> 04:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
year I know this so when I put the bill
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
in for drafting OS made me aware that it
 
04:49:30.590 --> 04:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
was adjusted last year um and so we kind
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
of worked with that but I wasn't steeped
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
in it at the time so I I'll take your
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
word for it it was the only the first
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
exemption okay thank you thank you any
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
04:49:44.830 --> 04:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative an Ammon thank you uh
 
04:49:44.840 --> 04:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
representative an Ammon thank you uh

04:49:58.350 --> 04:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
Club good afternoon chair Aon members of
 
04:49:59.708 --> 04:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
the committee Stacy oer with the
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
American Kennel Club and on House Bill
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
1556 um we do have concerns about the
 
04:50:11.708 --> 04:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
Bill's attempt to loosen the
 
04:50:13.750 --> 04:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for exemption from the
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine and uh in particular to
 
04:50:19.150 --> 04:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
eliminate the requirement that a muzzle
 
04:50:21.628 --> 04:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
be used on an exempt dog when
 
04:50:24.990 --> 04:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
Outdoors um if it was enacted it would
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
solely rely upon the exempt dog owner's
 
04:50:29.430 --> 04:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance with the remaining
 
04:50:31.470 --> 04:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
requirement that the dog be on a leash
 
04:50:34.350 --> 04:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
at all times to ensure Public Safety
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
and I cannot overstate the seriousness
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
of rabies which is a potentially fatal
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
zunic disease most often transmitted
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
through the bite of a rabbit
 
04:50:50.590 --> 04:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
animal just uh Googling quick about
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
rabies in New Hampshire and the
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
incidents of that
 
04:50:58.510 --> 04:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
um an article came up that last in
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
November two stray kittens in New
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tested positive for rabies and
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
the authorities were working to identify
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
people who may have been exposed to the
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
rabies after these two stray kittens in
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
North Conway tested positive for the
 
04:51:14.350 --> 04:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
disease so a concerned citizen picked up
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
the first kitten with rabies took it to
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Area Humane Society New Hampshire
 
04:51:21.548 --> 04:51:21.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health and Human
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
Services uh two Veterinary practices
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
cared for the kitten before it started
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
exhibiting symptoms and uh two days
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
later it tested positive officials said
 
04:51:32.548 --> 04:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
the people who had Direct contact with
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
the infected kitten might
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
require preventative treatment and we're
 
04:51:38.430 --> 04:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
identified so the reason I bring this up
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
is as a dog owner for instance obviously
 
04:51:44.590 --> 04:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
we all enjoy and appreciate that our
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
dogs need exercise and you want to be
 
04:51:48.670 --> 04:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
able to go out and let them off leash
 
04:51:50.670 --> 04:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
maybe in a wooded area or something of
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
that nature if a dog has not been
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for R for rabies the root of
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
transmission is a bite and there are
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
different types of muzzles available out
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
there um some of you might think of as
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
being a little bit constraining um if
 
04:52:09.788 --> 04:52:09.798 align:start position:0%
let's say you're going to run with your
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
dog get them some exercise can they
 
04:52:14.548 --> 04:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
breathe and perspire
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
adequately they do have something called
 
04:52:19.868 --> 04:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
a basket muzzle which just sits on the
 
04:52:22.030 --> 04:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
nose and it allows the dog to open its
 
04:52:23.708 --> 04:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
mouth and pant and whatnot so I just
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that a muzzle doesn't
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
have to be something that's restrictive
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
um but it would in fact prevent a bite
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
um if you had a dog that's muzzled let's
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
say it had a bite history or something
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
of that nature inevitably as the dog
 
04:52:38.430 --> 04:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
owner you would never let it off the
 
04:52:40.030 --> 04:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
leash because it wouldn't be able to
 
04:52:41.788 --> 04:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
protect itself if something attacked it
 
04:52:44.788 --> 04:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
so uh in our estimation the highest
 
04:52:48.110 --> 04:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
priority is the muzzle um being on a dog
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
that is has clearly not been um
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for rabies so I just wanted
 
04:52:56.990 --> 04:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
to make those TP couple of examples for
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
you all and I'm happy to take any
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have any
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby so um does it ever occur
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
that uh an owner has a dog on on its
 
04:53:13.990 --> 04:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
leash and the dog manages to escape from
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
the owner anyway oh sure if you had a
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
big dog sure if they saw something and
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to take off after it they could
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point uh
 
04:53:22.958 --> 04:53:25.110 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point uh
representative

04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:27.510 --> 04:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
Bixby any other questions from the
 
04:53:31.628 --> 04:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you Miss
 
04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
Holmes and I just want to say after that
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
I only have one more pink card so if
 
04:53:58.350 --> 04:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
there's anyone else who wishes to speak
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill please um let me
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:06.390 align:start position:0%
on this bill please um let me
know

04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.150 --> 04:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
well my name is Nancy Holmes I'm here
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
today from New Boston in opposition to
 
04:54:10.400 --> 04:54:11.270 align:start position:0%
today from New Boston in opposition to
this

04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
bill um as I live out in the country I
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
have perhaps a little more sensitive to
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
the um topic of rabies and animals than
 
04:54:22.868 --> 04:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
some others might be I've given a lot of
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
thought about this about the animals
 
04:54:26.670 --> 04:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
that can't be vaccinated for their own
 
04:54:29.070 --> 04:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
safety against rabies and the
 
04:54:31.030 --> 04:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
protections that keep these animals safe
 
04:54:33.670 --> 04:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
while also keeping the public safe I
 
04:54:36.510 --> 04:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
believe the rabies isolation uh method
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
and the muzzle rule should be kept in
 
04:54:41.548 --> 04:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
place a muzzle even a soft rubber one
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
prevents bites and protects the public
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
that same muzzle also issues serves as a
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
warning to people to be cautious of
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
interactions and to speak to the owner
 
04:54:54.990 --> 04:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
before approaching the
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
dog um I believe the verification of the
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
dog status is needing an exemption by
 
04:55:04.548 --> 04:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
three person persons in the first year
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
of exemption is a necessary method to
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
avoid fraudulent exemption claims you
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
know your brother-in-law could sign an
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
exemption for you I don't think that
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
would work um there there really are
 
04:55:19.350 --> 04:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
people out there who are so anti
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination that they would not
 
04:55:23.150 --> 04:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinate the dog against rabies if they
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
could figure out a way to get out of it
 
04:55:27.070 --> 04:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
legally so yes there are dogs that are
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
sick and should not have the vaccine
 
04:55:32.070 --> 04:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
because it's not safe for them but I'm
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
not so sure about the people who try to
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
get around things we seem to have a lot
 
04:55:38.910 --> 04:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
of that lately um I don't see any
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
advantage to the public as in changing
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the law as it stands we tried really
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
hard last year to make it less honorous
 
04:55:48.190 --> 04:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
by saying okay first time around you've
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
got to get everybody sign off that yeah
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
your dog really needs this um not only
 
04:55:55.470 --> 04:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
does that prevent fraud but it also
 
04:55:57.628 --> 04:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
gives you a shot at maybe some other vet
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
an internal medicine vet saying hey I
 
04:56:03.548 --> 04:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
know what we can do about this um I just
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
don't see I think it's a a mild
 
04:56:07.868 --> 04:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to an
 
04:56:11.788 --> 04:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
owner and I think Public Safety warrants
 
04:56:11.798 --> 04:56:12.548 align:start position:0%
owner and I think Public Safety warrants
that

04:56:12.548 --> 04:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
effort be happy to answer any questions
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:32.280 --> 04:56:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
Ferrari

04:56:48.910 --> 04:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon we're getting
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
close to wrapping up for the day yeah uh
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
Angela Ferrari dog owners of the Granite
 
04:57:00.390 --> 04:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
State and we oppose this bill um a lot
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
of great things have been covered so
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just touch on a few things
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
um imuno compromised dogs they can still
 
04:57:09.990 --> 04:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
get rabies so while we understand that
 
04:57:11.430 --> 04:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
we need to be cautious about their
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
health in receiving vaccinations we do
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
need to take it very seriously that they
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
could contract the disease not only to
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
other animals but to people as well so
 
04:57:26.110 --> 04:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
we do have public health risk um by
 
04:57:29.708 --> 04:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
relaxing the laws regarding rabies
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
exemptions Animal Welfare concerns as
 
04:57:35.310 --> 04:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
well um um removing the requirement for
 
04:57:37.390 --> 04:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
strict isolation and muzzle use puts
 
04:57:39.708 --> 04:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
Exempted animals at risk of Contracting
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
rabies continuing as I said before
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing the health of others the
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
topic of muzzles I think is really
 
04:57:50.670 --> 04:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
interesting and I hadn't put a lot of
 
04:57:52.390 --> 04:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
thought into it until I started hearing
 
04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony today I wish I had brought
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
a video and if I remember maybe I will
 
04:58:00.310 --> 04:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
send it to you all but my cousin who has
 
04:58:03.628 --> 04:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
a dog who recently was neutered
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
um she needed to use a muzzle on him
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
because no matter what size cone or this
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
or that she put on the dog he could
 
04:58:13.868 --> 04:58:13.878 align:start position:0%
still access the the Staples he was not
 
04:58:17.470 --> 04:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to and utilizing treats and
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
everything he willingly will go over to
 
04:58:21.750 --> 04:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
the muzzle when it is on the table and
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
try to put his face in it because he
 
04:58:28.030 --> 04:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
knows that he gets treats um you know so
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
they can be introduced to them and
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
socialized to them in such a way that
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
that it really isn't something that's
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
going to be a negative impact to the dog
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
and there are a various array of types
 
04:58:42.670 --> 04:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
of muzzles so that you can find one
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's comfortable not too bulky and is
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
going to serve your dog in the right way
 
04:58:51.070 --> 04:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
um as you know I breed Dobermans and we
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
often refer to them as Dober goats and
 
04:58:56.350 --> 04:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
that is because they will eat anything
 
04:58:59.390 --> 04:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
that they can find from grass to leaves
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
to branches to anything and many people
 
04:59:05.948 --> 04:59:05.958 align:start position:0%
need to utilize muzzles on their dogs
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
consistently while they're out in the
 
04:59:10.590 --> 04:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
yard to prevent them from eating things
 
04:59:12.030 --> 04:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't which could then
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
result in a blockage um which is pretty
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
scary as well so there are a lot of dogs
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
utilizing muzzles for other reasons and
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
utilizing them um consistently on a
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
daily basis with no issues another thing
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
to mention in regards to muzzles is uh I
 
04:59:31.470 --> 04:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
participate in corean ability trials
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
with my dogs that's when they chase a
 
04:59:37.948 --> 04:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
bag that's on a line around a Big Field
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
um and you will often see dogs who are
 
04:59:43.390 --> 04:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
wearing muzzles during that activity
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
because they may not work well with
 
04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
other dogs and they are loose to protect
 
04:59:51.070 --> 04:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
the other dogs they're utilizing a
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
muzzle in a very high endurance activity
 
04:59:58.510 --> 04:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
um very successfully so just a few
 
05:00:01.110 --> 05:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
examples that muzzles you know can be
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
comfortable can be used in a WI variety
 
05:00:06.510 --> 05:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
of instances and with the benefits that
 
05:00:09.470 --> 05:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
we get for dogs who don't need or aren't
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
able to get the vaccine um it shouldn't
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
be looked at as something that's
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
extremely negative um and then lastly I
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
just want to mention the reduction of
 
05:00:24.868 --> 05:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
oversight in that initial exemption um
 
05:00:26.910 --> 05:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
by cutting out the state
 
05:00:30.070 --> 05:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and the American College of
 
05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Internal Medicine um we think
 
05:00:36.590 --> 05:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
that reduces the expert oversight that's
 
05:00:39.788 --> 05:00:39.798 align:start position:0%
so important in making the decision on
 
05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
if this animal truly is a candidate for
 
05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
such a serious exemption it isn't
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
something as Nancy stated earlier that
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
should be done willy-nilly by anybody um
 
05:00:53.150 --> 05:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
it really needs to be thought through
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
are there other avenues of getting this
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine into this dog that are safe a
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
lot of holistic vets have a plan in
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
place for if we have dog that is going
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
to be compromised by any sort of vaccine
 
05:01:08.430 --> 05:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
but we understand the importance of
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
making sure they're protected we're
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
going to follow a set of um guidelines
 
05:01:17.230 --> 05:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
before and after the vaccine is given so
 
05:01:18.910 --> 05:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
it's important that all of these things
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
are considered before just saying you
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
know I don't like the rabus vaccine this
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
vet's willing to sign off and say I
 
05:01:28.590 --> 05:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
don't need it and now I'm good to go
 
05:01:30.110 --> 05:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
because I don't have to prove it to the
 
05:01:32.548 --> 05:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
state vet or this other uh veterinarian
 
05:01:35.230 --> 05:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
community community so with those few
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
things um we would oppose this bill and
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to answer any questions
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murray and then Bixby
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
sure I'm still correct in the assumption
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
that um to this date there is no cure
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
for rabies is that accurate I am not
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
aware of one no purum fixby yeah so um
 
05:02:03.708 --> 05:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
when uh is there a period between the
 
05:02:05.708 --> 05:02:05.718 align:start position:0%
time that an animal gets exposed to
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
rabies and the time that it starts to
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
show symptoms so that you could suspect
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
sick I do know that there's a period of
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
time when they will not be showing
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
symptoms so I think that's the more
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
critical piece is that they could be
 
05:02:24.270 --> 05:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
exposed by getting a bite or they don't
 
05:02:26.350 --> 05:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
even have to receive a bite they could
 
05:02:29.670 --> 05:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
get the saliva from a rabbit animal into
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
a cut or you know into themselves some
 
05:02:35.590 --> 05:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
how so you wouldn't even see a bite on
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
your dog uh to know that they may have
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
been exposed and then could
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
inadvertently be exposing them where
 
05:02:44.110 --> 05:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
they could transmit it before they start
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
showing signs I do not recall the exact
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
incubation period before symptoms would
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
show okay represent Penza this might
 
05:02:56.990 --> 05:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
have been covered before but has um do
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
we know the numbers of dogs that have
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
had rabies in the last I don't know
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
let's say five or 10 years in New
 
05:03:06.110 --> 05:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did you have that Stacey no we
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
can look that up for you and and make
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
sure we follow up with that information
 
05:03:12.548 --> 05:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
we can also get that from the state
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
veteran that's what I was going to say
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.750 --> 05:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure would you be okay with the bill if
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
it just um if it didn't strike out in
 
05:03:27.150 --> 05:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
regards with the muzzle and then but the
 
05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
other two strikeouts were there so we
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
would still oppose uh not having the
 
05:03:34.110 --> 05:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian in the American
 
05:03:36.270 --> 05:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
College of Veterinary internal medicine
 
05:03:38.788 --> 05:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
as part of that initial exemption
 
05:03:41.430 --> 05:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
approval so we would like to see that
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
remain the piece that I would consider
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
and would want to take back to my
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
colleagues um after kind of thinking
 
05:03:51.150 --> 05:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
through it more today would be the
 
05:03:53.548 --> 05:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
strict rabies isolation and what that
 
05:03:55.628 --> 05:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
means um so I would want to know a
 
05:03:57.868 --> 05:03:57.878 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
exactly that means but I think the
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
muzzle piece and the Vets is very
 
05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
can I one more follow follow um yeah I I
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
think that the that Exempted animal is
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
really kind of um insane it's I don't
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
know who would monitor that and it just
 
05:04:19.150 --> 05:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
seems a little um over the top so now if
 
05:04:21.548 --> 05:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
a licensed
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um signs off on this
 
05:04:26.830 --> 05:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation what's the process for
 
05:04:29.708 --> 05:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
them to have to then jump a hoop to go
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
to the American College of Veterinary
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
Internal Medicine Diplomat and state
 
05:04:37.788 --> 05:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
veterinarian it seems as if so are we
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
not trusting uh we not trusting our vets
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
to be able to if they put something in a
 
05:04:45.990 --> 05:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
in a in a legal document that we trust
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
them with that that we have to then make
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
them jump through another hoop I don't I
 
05:04:52.270 --> 05:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
don't understand that I think it's
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
because of the public safety concerns
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
that the state veterinarian is involved
 
05:04:59.230 --> 05:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
determination and because we do have a
 
05:05:05.110 --> 05:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
WI variety of opinions across the
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
veterinary field and some who may be
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
more lenient in being anti- rabes and
 
05:05:14.310 --> 05:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
not wanting to move forward with those
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in general could be
 
05:05:19.628 --> 05:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
providing those exemptions when it maybe
 
05:05:22.030 --> 05:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
truly isn't detrimental to the health of
 
05:05:24.628 --> 05:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
the animal thank you representative
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
Marie thank you madam chair I I was just
 
05:05:28.830 --> 05:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
going to comment on on and this is just
 
05:05:30.788 --> 05:05:30.798 align:start position:0%
a point of clarification that um the
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian has the the oversight
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
over infectious disease and zoonotic
 
05:05:37.350 --> 05:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
disease transfer around things like
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
rabies so I think that that is why that
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
inclusion is in
 
05:05:45.548 --> 05:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for Miss
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
Ferrari seeing none thank you very much
 
05:05:50.510 --> 05:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much and the last
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%

Phelps good afternoon and welcome to
 
05:05:56.200 --> 05:06:01.390 align:start position:0%
Phelps good afternoon and welcome to
environment

05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
agriculture put your microphone on there
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
there you go okay you're all set can you
 
05:06:07.310 --> 05:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
all hear me thank you for having me here
 
05:06:11.070 --> 05:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
today um I am in support of this bill
 
05:06:14.830 --> 05:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
and um I will just tell you that unlike
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
maybe anybody else in the room I have
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
experience getting a medical exemption
 
05:06:21.510 --> 05:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
on an animal in 2017 I had a dog that
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with fatal cancer she was
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
10 years old that diagnosis
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
coincidentally occurred the same month
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
that she was supposed to get her booster
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
so the veterinarian
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
gave me the medical exemption Instead
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
This cancer um attacked her digestive
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
system so she was nauseous and having to
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
put a muzzle on her when sometimes I
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
know she just wants to go outside to get
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
some fresh air was a hardship for both
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
of us sadly she died within a month of
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
Her diagnosis so this didn't last very
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
long I now have a 14-year-old G ner who
 
05:07:01.590 --> 05:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
has non-cancerous liver tumors some of
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
them were surgically removed in the
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
summer of 2022 the ones that could not
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
be removed are growing and he's on
 
05:07:10.948 --> 05:07:10.958 align:start position:0%
medication to help his liver function
 
05:07:13.430 --> 05:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
properly in the spring of
 
05:07:16.430 --> 05:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
2023 he was up for his rabies
 
05:07:18.430 --> 05:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination and he did receive it
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
because he was deemed not sick enough to
 
05:07:23.590 --> 05:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
get the exemption a few days later he
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
was in the ER nearly dying of a liver
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
infection this is not considered an
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
allergic reaction to the rabus vaccine
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
but I believe his liver was not healthy
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
enough to handle the extra stress of a
 
05:07:38.230 --> 05:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination at that time should I be
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to still have this dog when
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
he's 16 years old he will be up for
 
05:07:45.230 --> 05:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
another rabies vaccine I doubt he would
 
05:07:47.470 --> 05:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
survive it but I also would not look
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
forward to putting him in a muzzle for
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
the last days of his life dogs that are
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
getting these medical exemptions often
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
have digestive issues or need to be
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
rushed outside to relieve themselves and
 
05:08:02.948 --> 05:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
taking the time to muzzle them is an
 
05:08:06.270 --> 05:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
extra burden especially if the dogs are
 
05:08:08.910 --> 05:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
vomiting on top of that I wonder that if
 
05:08:10.750 --> 05:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's really necessary to treat these
 
05:08:13.350 --> 05:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
dogs the same as if they have had an
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
exposure to rabies if one of these dogs
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
is exposed to rabies we already have
 
05:08:23.788 --> 05:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
laws specifically RSA sections 436 105
 
05:08:23.798 --> 05:08:25.070 align:start position:0%
laws specifically RSA sections 436 105
and

05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:28.270 --> 05:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
43616 that would take into effect for
 
05:08:30.868 --> 05:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
example one of these dogs could be
 
05:08:34.590 --> 05:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
considered a past their vaccination the
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
veterinarian and the dog owner could
 
05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
decide at that time to vaccinate them
 
05:08:41.150 --> 05:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
and conine them to the house for 45 days
 
05:08:44.070 --> 05:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
or opt for the stricter option which is
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
in section 1061 a at the owner's expense
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
the dog would be confined outside of
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
their home on top of that there is a
 
05:08:56.030 --> 05:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
study out of the University of Wisconsin
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
that shows they say confirmed that
 
05:09:01.150 --> 05:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine May induce a duration of
 
05:09:03.430 --> 05:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
immunity with well beyond three years in
 
05:09:06.750 --> 05:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
dogs so they're they had 80% of dogs
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
tested in their study were still
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
protected against rabies six years after
 
05:09:13.150 --> 05:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
a rabies vaccine had been administered
 
05:09:14.670 --> 05:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
the dogs who are getting the rabies
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
exemption have followed the
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
protocol their whole life up until the
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
day they are deemed too Med too sick to
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
get this exemption and according to this
 
05:09:28.150 --> 05:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
study they are highly likely to still be
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
protected against rabies even if they
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
have been exposed it seems seems like a
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary burden to muzzle these
 
05:09:38.830 --> 05:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
dogs when they go outside especially if
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
you keep in the build strict isolation
 
05:09:42.990 --> 05:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
these are not dogs that are going out in
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
public um they are just staying in their
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
owner's yards they and they're not going
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
to last long enough to worry
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
about exposure to rabies because they're
 
05:09:56.270 --> 05:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
being let off leash in the woods and
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
being exposed to wild animals
 
05:10:03.150 --> 05:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take so do you believe
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
that um there should be some provision
 
05:10:11.070 --> 05:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
for dogs who have uh some
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
life-threatening illnesses like cancer
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
or uh some uh GI issues that um they
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
should be exempt from having to deal
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
with the rabies protocol well I I feel
 
05:10:30.430 --> 05:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
like the research that went into
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
allowing the state of New Hampshire to
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a rabes exemption which I
 
05:10:35.990 --> 05:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
completely appreciate
 
05:10:38.430 --> 05:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
um that all of those decisions should be
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
made by veterinarians who are State
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
Certified and if we're not trusting our
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarians through our state
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
certification process then that needs to
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
be looked into but if the dog is sick
 
05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
enough to get
 
05:10:52.240 --> 05:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
enough to get
Rab's

05:10:53.830 --> 05:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
Rab's
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
exemption that's a decision that the
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
veterinarian should make not the dog
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
owner if that answers your question
 
05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:02.628 align:start position:0%
owner if that answers your question
sure

05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
sure
