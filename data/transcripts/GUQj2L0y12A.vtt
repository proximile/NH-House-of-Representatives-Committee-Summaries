you are not allowed to ask questions and
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
that you are not um if you were in some
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%

members of the committee and members of
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
the public originally I was coming in to
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
476 however a request for withdrawal has
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
sub been submitted to the house clerk
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so ladies and
 
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
gentlemen just so that you understand
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
and um what is what this means there has
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
been a a uh according to representative
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
pill she has submitted a request to have
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
withdrawn that as I understand the rules
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
and I you know if somebody if I'm wrong
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
on this because this is not something
 
00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:20.759 align:start position:0%
that has happened happens very often if
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong on this and somebody has uh
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
knows knows that I'm wrong please
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
correct me but the process is that when
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
this kind of a request happens at this
 
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
stage where a bill has already been
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
hearing all the the sponsor and all of
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors have to agree and then
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the matter has to go to the house floor
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
for a vote of the house floor whether to
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
approve the withdrawal of the bill that
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
could not happen at the earliest until
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
February 6th so the bottom line of that
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
and who knows whether that would happen
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
or not so the bottom line is we are
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
going going forward with the hearing
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
today on the bill and the amendment so
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um uh you know obviously
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
the the fact that the sponsor and
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
apparently co-sponsors have requested to
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
withdraw the bill I would think I could
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
be wrong on this but I would think that
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
strongly increases the chance that the
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill will not succeed but I don't know
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
that um for sure so we're going to have
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
your you know so obviously people who
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
have who have heed here to testify where
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the hearing and you
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
should be proud proud of the fact that
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
we have a low maternal mortality rate
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
and the lowest teen pregnancy rate in
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
America this is not by chance this is
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
due to the hard work that the medical
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
community provides for the women of New
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since 2022 since Row versus
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
Wade was overturned the states with laws
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
like HB 476 have the highest maternal
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
mortality rate and teen pregnancy rate
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
the more restrictive the higher the rate
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
this is not by chance it is true of all
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
states that have adopted restrictions
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
like HB
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
476 America has the highest maternal
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
mortality rate in the industrialized
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
world this is an American crisis and
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done to reverse this
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
deplorable statistic and not contribute
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
to it by adopting laws like HB
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
476 the consequences of HB 476 are
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
Beyond abortion access it will affect
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
all women of reproductive age and Beyond
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive laws result in Obi deserts
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
which is the term used for a severe
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
shortage of OBGYNs we train OBGYN
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
residents from Dartmouth and TS
 
00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
University here in New Hampshire all
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
residents must complete a residency pro
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
project recently I asked a resident what
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
she was focused on for her project and
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
she replied Obie deserts she is from
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
Utah and her preliminary investigation
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
indicated that 80% of OBGYNs had left
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
her home state since
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
2022 does New Hampshire want to become
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
an OB desert the residents will not be
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
adequately trained to handle a
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
complicated medical condition arising
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
from a restrictive law like HB 476 nor
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
will they choose to practice here we
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
need young well-trained Obi Joan
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
providers to stay in practice ice in New
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not drive them away with
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive laws a few years ago an obgy
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine in Houston Texas was
 
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
informed that a 17-year-old woman had
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
died of sepsis in her hospital that
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
morning in Houston Texas a world leader
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
of medical care this young woman was
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
pregnant and suffered the unfortunate
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
circumstance of breaking her water at 18
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
weeks too early for fetal viability and
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
with the ominous risk of becoming
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
dangerously infected with sepsis with no
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
chance for fetal survival she went with
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
her mother to hospital number one and
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
because she did not have a fever and a
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
fetal heartbeat she was told to go home
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
later that week she went to hospital
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
number two with the same no fever with a
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
fetal heart rate go home the next week
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
she went to hospital number three with a
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
fever and a fetal heart rate providers
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
are strapped with an exclusion clause
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
which I will quote an OB from Dallas
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
stating it's like a vigilante on your
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
back with the real chance of
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
imprisonment for up to 99 years in Texas
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
so they admitted her and gave her
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
antibiotics but did not perform the
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
life-saving procedure you know I'm sorry
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
abortion if she lived in New Hampshire
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
she would be alive today thank you very
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%

resident I'm a retired obstetrician
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
gynecologist and I practiced in this
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
area for 32 years I'm here to testify
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
against HP 476 which seeks to introduce
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
a 15we abortion ban one year ago in
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
January of 2024 I had the privilege of
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
testifying before the Senate Judiciary
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
Committee in support of three bills
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
which would have enshrined the right to
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
the full spectrum of reproductive care
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Constitution create
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
shield laws to protect our medical
 
00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:29.149 align:start position:0%
shield laws to protect our medical
providers

00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh from out ofate prosecution if we
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
treat patients who come to New Hampshire
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
for care and to ensure that citizens
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
have safe and and effective have access
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
to safe and effective abortion
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
medications the committee chose not to
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
pass any of those bills and the reason
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
given at the time was because New
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already had an abortion ban at
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
24 weeks a compromise that the
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
legislators on the committee said they
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
were very pleased with and saw no reason
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
to change one year later this body is
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
now proposing a 15we abortion ban
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
something that our newly elected
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
Governor repeatedly guaranteed that she
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
would veto why New Hampshire needs a
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
more restrictive abortion policy is not
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
clear to me but what will happen should
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
this law be passed is on Full display in
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
other states with abortion bans first
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
and foremost women will die
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily since the dobs decision at
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
least three women have died in Texas due
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
to delayed or mismanaged second
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
Advanced infection or fatal Hemorrhage
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
while local laws forbade or delayed
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate And Timely Care at least two
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
women have died in Georgia both from
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
infection caused by incomplete emptying
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the uterus State Medical re review
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
boards in both States ruled that those
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
deaths were preventable but in Georgia
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
the performance of a DNC the surgical
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
procedure used to empty the uterus can
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
be a felony and in Texas Medical
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
providers who who violate the state's
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
abortion ban risk up to 99 years in
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
prison fines of of $100,000 and loss of
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
their medical licenses exceptions to
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
protect the life of the mother have not
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
provided the protections for which they
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
were intended the confusion over what
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
medical complications make a pregnancy
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
too dangerous to continue how sick is
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
sick enough to intervene how much blood
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
loss is too much how bad must an
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
infection get before life-saving
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
measures can be instituted this
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
confusion is what creates the delays
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
that kill women and trying to create
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
laws which are more explicit about these
 
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
issues is Not Practical expecting laws
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
to account for all the ways that a
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy can go wrong is like expecting
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
an elephant to play the piano they
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
really can't do it and the music or in
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
this case women's lives will suffer the
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire ban at 24 weeks
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
allows that most Mis miscarriage
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
management can be conducted under the
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
standard of Safe And Timely Medical Care
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
decreasing that ban to 15 weeks does not
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
in fact reduce the number of abortions
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
performed and pushes the most complex
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
miscarriage management into the gray
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
areas which are so fatal for women and
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
be aware that this 15we ban includes no
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
exceptions for rape incest or the health
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the mother desperate women will take
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
matters into their own hand I'm sorry
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
you're you're 3 minutes is up um
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
terrific so if you if you have a you
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
know one or two more sentences you want
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to finish up that's fine but I we have a
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people here today I I do um that
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh the previous speaker spoke about um
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
about OBG Wan's leaving the area and and
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%

the
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%

told her mom she was

during my time of practice as an obser
 
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
gynecologist Row the roow decision had
 
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
been made making certain that women had

access to Safe
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%

00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
procedure that terminated the pregnancy
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
and I did provide that for my patients
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
who made that difficult decision I fear
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
that we could return to the brutal

thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee fellow graned Staters uh I'm
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the issue of the
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
pro- life but I see no enemies here I
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
see people trying to do the right thing
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
and just uh we don't agree on what the
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
right thing is I've uh given you the
 
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.029 align:start position:0%
right thing is I've uh given you the
written

00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:26.519 align:start position:0%
testimony so uh I think I think I like
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
the bill I like the direction the bill
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
moving in uh I thought it maybe needed
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
some more support maybe we need to
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
collect signatures CU people just you
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
know vot on 24 weeks or take some other
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
steps I list some suggestions there for
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
you uh but I also like that the bill
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
positioned us to aim higher and save
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
even more lives so uh if you if you
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
think you can get it past just the way
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
it is fantastic go for it but if not
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's some suggestions for improvement
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
in here uh including uh attacking that
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
mat interal mortality rate kind of look
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
at a whole ecosystem of lives get
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
focused on saving lives and I I hear my
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues with lives lost uh we got to
 
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:08.519 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to save lives next
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
picture kind of shows what 15 weeks does
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
for us in Saving Lives it's uh every
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
block is 1% in here so today we allowed
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
about 99% of abortions this would take
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
it down to about 95 so it's a modest
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement but in not Improvement
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
nevertheless to save some lives but we
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
could be uh crushing that and uh really
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
save given many many more lives by kind
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
of stepping away from the practice but
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
retaining all the things that saved the
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
lives of the mother there is another
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
life that's lost every time there's an
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
abortion and uh that a picture it's a
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
little hard to see was another rookie
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
mistake I uh I intended to give each of
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
you a little model but I heard you don't
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
accept props so I'll just put this back
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
in my pocket but that's uh that's a 10we
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
old not a 15we oldal 2 in long got her
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
own DNA got her own face fingers uh toes
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
and more I just don't think that wiping
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
nose out is Healthcare right I think we
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
can do better uh you know we're all
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
created at one point equal with the
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
right to life liberty Pursuit of
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
Happiness what was that moment of
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
creation we all had the same start we
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
all started as that embryo you me
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
everybody that was everyone that ever
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
will be that's a human that's that's all
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
a person is at that point in time I
 
00:31:27.149 --> 00:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
think it all depends how you frame the
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
issue is it a three-person reality with
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
a man and a woman and another life
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
involved or is it a oneperson reality
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
just a woman's issue I think it's a
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
three-person reality and in conclusion
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
I'd say there are many other realities
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
we've embraced in our history we used to
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
think slavery was acceptable killing
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
Native Americans right smoking was not
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
harmful right and how about those oxy
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
painkillers we have destroyed millions
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
and millions of lives with these things
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
that we've clinged to and for me
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
abortion is on this list more millions
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
of lives destroyed if you consider the
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
person inside you know a human life and
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
so it kind comes down to that you know
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
are we going to you know have this on
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
our list of big regrets or we going to
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
step away from it I promise you this sir
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
your your three minute time is really up
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
so I'd appreciate if you if you have one
 
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
or two more sentences fine but then I'd

like to ask you to uh yeah finish up
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's a prediction making it on that
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
list here's a promise we will never
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
regret focusing on saving lives thank
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
you for your time you very much all
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
right Miss Carlile and the next uh

witness will be repres after M carile
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
will be representative Jee n um Mr chair
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
yeah could you please make clear to the
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
audience that we do not um tolerate or
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
accept uh expressions of approval or
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
disapproval we just listen respectfully
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
to what people say that's your
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is absolutely right
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
please uh you know refrain from the we
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
the theatrics it it's not uh it's it's
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
not particularly helpful and I I suspect
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
P persuasive to anyone anyway please go
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
ahead hi so first thing I'll say right
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
off the bat my mother had nine kids
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
three more pregnancies a still born and
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
two miscarriages she'd probably be a
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
criminal today and I just think this is
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
appalling um in the newspaper was
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
suggested that women should just give
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
their babies up for adoption that's fine
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
for a man to say but many women
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
experience debilitating morning sickness
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
for months if she has to miss work
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
because she's sick who is replacing that
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
income many service sector jobs don't
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
even offer paid sick time many employers
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
discriminate against women for the very
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
fact that they can get pregnant I worked
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
at a company that paid for college
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
classes except they were reluctant to do
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
so because I could get pregnant and
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
leave justess how many men improved
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
their education only to move on to a
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
better paying job I know I could not
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
give up a child for adoption worrying
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
about where that child is and was it
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
being treated lovingly as a single
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
parent I had to miss workk anytime my
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
child was sick many two parent
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
households this still falls on the woman
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
the average cost of daycare if you can
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
even find it is approximately $77,000 a
 
00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:24.190 align:start position:0%
even find it is approximately $77,000 a
year

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
$325 a week you can forget about working
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
if if you have two kids housing in the
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is beyond the
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
reach of many people basic necessities
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
like groceries heating bills electricity
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
Etc are stressing family budgets you're
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
accusing women of being frivolous for
 
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599 align:start position:0%
considering financial reasons not to
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
have a child it seems irresponsible to
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
have a child or children when you can't
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
afford it you talk about the state
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
giving support to the child until it
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
reaches 18 nice try but the state and
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can't pay their own bills
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
especially the cost of Education a woman
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
needs financial help through Medicaid or
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
welfare lawmakers want to force her off
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
to to get off to work or off the program
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
all together so no I don't believe you
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
will help for a second politicians have
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
no business deciding when or if a family
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
brings a child into this world I suggest
 
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
you work on high property taxes the lack
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
of affordable housing and child care
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
which would help more families actually
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
be able to afford having a child and I
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
could add that a woman's overall
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
lifetime income is generally lower if
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
she has to stay home and take care of
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
children she misses out on promotions at
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
work her social security benefits of
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
401k contributions will suffer thank you
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative genan ner
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'll I'll be
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
very quick um there was an email sent
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
out this morning telling the pro-life
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
Community to stay home because they'd
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
heard that the will the bill had been
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
withdrawn um I did not get that email it
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
was shown to me down the hall um and I
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
know that this bill isn't likely to pass
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
and both parties are against it but for
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
different reasons and I certainly don't
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
want to jeopardize the small gains we
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
have made in the in the Life issue
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
I understand why an amendment was
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
drafted and I co-sponsor the same uh the
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
statistics bill in the other body but
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to my caucus I have
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
a higher power to answer to and my
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
conscience dictates that I must go on
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
record supporting the sanctity of
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
innocent human life lastly to quote Dr
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
Seuss a person is a person no matter how
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
small thank you thank you um uh next
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
would be Lynn Hill and on Deck will be
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
gaso good morning hi I tell my children
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
there are no good outcomes to an
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
unwanted pregnancy not a Loveless
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
marriage not abortion and not adoption
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
all of these possibilities are flawed
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire abortion laws are already
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
adequate no one can get an abortion in
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
the third trimester except for the life
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the mother or fatal fetal diagnosis
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
10 to 20% of pregnancies end in
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
miscarriage that's uh data from Mayo
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
Clinic this bill could force a girl to
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
seek an abortion for a pregnancy that
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
might have ended
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
naturally according to the CDC only a
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of abortions occur
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the third trimester about 1%
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
and you cannot find someone to do this
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
just because you want an abortion right
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
you got to have a real reason for that
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
so most um 90 to 95 % of abortions occur
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
in the first trimester about five to six
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
second um this date is corroborated by
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
Willie Parker a man of strong faith who
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
changed his Outlook that helping women
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
in need is like being a Good Samaritan
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
his book is called life's work and I
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend it he went from being
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
a fundamentalist Christian to being a
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
compassionate Christian providing
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
abortion in Alabama 15 weeks is just not
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
enough time to realize your PR schedule
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
the doctor's appointment schedule an
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
appointment with an abortion provider
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
travel to the appointment and incur the
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
cost this also assumes the girl not only
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
tracks her periods but has regular
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
periods and this is not often the case
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
and one have any of us tried to get a
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
medical or specialty appointment
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
recently my doctors are often scheduling
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
three months out or further and there
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
are fewer abortion providers available
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
every day thanks to pressure from
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislators and so-called religious
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
groups trans transportation and cost are
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
a huge barrier to the
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
girl I think legislators who pass
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
abortion restrictions often picture
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
these unwanted pregnancies turning into
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
Happy nuclear families or that the baby
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
is put up for adoption Studies have
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
shown that about 10% of women denied an
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
abortion will actually put the baby up
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
for adoption there are many reasons for
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
this and of course where are the men
 
00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
right big it off like scotf
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
free if a woman keeps a baby she does
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
not want and did not choose to birth it
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
may end okay but you should consider the
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
more likely Alternatives children
 
00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:35.790 align:start position:0%
more likely Alternatives children
unwanted

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
unwanted
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
neglected abused living in squal or in
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
filthy Apartments living with parents on
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
drugs with no food in the house 133% of
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children are food
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
insecure I work at a food bank uh the
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
children may also even be homeless I
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
would recommend a book called
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
evicted children in uced into a home
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
where there already too little money
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
time and food is not
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
optimal these are homes where food and
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
electricity your time is up I'd ask you
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
to please finish up I will um there are
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
many reasons um that I oppose this bill
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
I would implore you uh to vote against
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
it if it comes to being let women decide
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
about their bodies and their lives thank
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%

galasso gaso version I hadn't heard in a
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
while um I'm here to support the bill uh
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
quick background I do sidewalk advocacy
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
for life been doing this for a Dozen
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
Years talk to hundreds and hundreds of
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
women going in and girls I should say
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
women and girls coming out I want to
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
talk about what happens to the baby I
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
know a lot happens to pregnant moms that
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to have children but what
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
happens to the baby I'll try to do this
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
as brief briefly as possible but um I
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
want you also to know that uh you can
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
look this information up
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
WebMD uh Mayo Clinic uh Dartmouth
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock okay there's four types uh
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
medical abortion uh the are you 46 two
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
Bill procedure first bill deprives the
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
baby of needed protein the baby dies and
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
then the second Bill causes miscarriage
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh these little babies uh are then um
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
miscarried in toilets and Flushed Away
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
first trimester
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
surgical is an evacuation process uh
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
vacuum basically is used to remove uh
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
the the baby uh uh relatively less
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
complicated second trimester is a
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
dilation and evacuation where there's
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
forp used uh to remove the baby and then
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
a cur it to scrape the inside to make
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
sure there isn't any residual uh baby
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
body uh material in the
 
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
uterus and then in the third trimester
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh dilation and
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
extraction and in this case the baby of
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
course is welldeveloped uh ready to be
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
born and uh forceps are used in this
 
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
case but they have grips on the ends
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
because they remove the baby's
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
limbs uh if removing the baby's limbs is
 
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
not adequate to remove the baby from the
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
mother's uterus uh the same device is
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
used to crush the
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
skull and if that's not adequate they'll
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
go back to the vacuum device and vacuum
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is what we're
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
allowing to happen in our country
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
thankfully in the state we've limited
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
abortions to 24
 
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:20.270 align:start position:0%
abortions to 24
[Music]

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
weeks I'd ask you all please just think
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
about what's really going on here thank
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
you thank thank you very much sir uh
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
next is James Johnston and on Deck will
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
Russell thank you chairman Lynn and uh
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
committee members um my name is James
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
Johnston and I am here against this bill
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not going to talk about
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
anything about you know what happens to
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
the women's body because there's so many
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
more stories here than what I can
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
provide but there's two main points that
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to come and talk about the two
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
points are one is I uh was raised uh
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
Christian uh raised nazarine and I am uh
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
a believer in Christ but I also believe
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have the choice of
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
religion within the United States and
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
the government is not um in a position
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
to be forcing certain viewpoints upon us
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh as Citizens to you know do one thing
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
or not do one thing based off of a uh a
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
religious standpoint or a religious
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
upbringing the second point is the great
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing about New Hampshire and one of the
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why I actually live here is the
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
fact that it is Live Free or Die is our
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
motto right we're here to you know live
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
free and be able to make our own choices
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
and choose the things that you know we
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
want to do without government in
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
interference you know where where is the
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
history of you know small government
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
right why why should the government be
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
pushing things on to us you know um and
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the fact is is that you know if you
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
know me and my partner were to have a
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
child right now you know it would go
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and and financially burden us to a
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
point that you know it wouldn't it
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make sense to us right it it
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
would cause us to potentially be a
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
burden on the state even further by
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
having a child because then you know if
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
I need a good EBT or or or similar and
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
so the thing
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
is people get to make their own choice
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
if it's founded by a choice on on
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
religion and on the sanc of Life great
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
they get to choose that but why is the
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
government why is the the state trying
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
to tell us what we can or cannot do and
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
I I I support people's decisions to you
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
know go ahead and you know you know
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
respect the the pregnancy and go and and
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
have that to term but I also respect the
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
choices of people to not do that and the
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
government should not be telling us what
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
to do thank you very much thank you very
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
much sir

about their care we're not ask could you
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
move just a little bit closer to the
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
microphone maybe thank you thanks sure
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
um but we are not just talking about any
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%

people with
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
uteruses throughout my career I've
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
encountered women facing incredibly
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
challenging circumstances survivors of
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
sexual assault those caring pregnancies
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
with devast fetal diagnoses women who
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
become pregnant despite careful
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
contraceptive use individuals navigating
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
poverty and family instability we've
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in maternal morbidity
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
and we've seen the devastating effects
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
of drug use on people's lives I've also
 
00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
witnessed the profound and beautiful
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
bonds between mothers and children and
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
their incredible resilience even in
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
difficult pregnancies and births as a
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
mother of three daughters and
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
anticipating the joy of becoming a
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
grandmother I understand the Prof found
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility of Parenthood however if
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
any of my children were to face an
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancy or if medical
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
complications arose that jeopardized
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
their health I would unequivocably
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
support their right to access safe and
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
legal abortion Care at any point in
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
their pregnancy like I said I really
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
really want grandchildren but it's
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
really not my decision it's not my life
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
that will be impacted it's not my body
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
that will carry the pregnancy and it
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be your decision either in
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
summary given my commitment to patient
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
autonomy offering support and
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
information to make informed choices I
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
cannot in good conscience support
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
lawmakers dictating Medical Care
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
patients in partnership with their
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
trusted healthc care providers should
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
really be the ones making the difficult
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
choice to get an abortion or continue
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
with their pregnancy at 6 weeks of
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy at 8 weeks of pregnancy at 15
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
weeks of pregnancy at 24 weeks of
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%

out that right in the I guess in the
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
front row there it appears that we have
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
a woman with two children one of whom
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
seems to have been standing for quite a
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
while so I'm going to call on you after
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%

Dr good morning I am Dr David Crowley I
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
live in Bedford New Hampshire I work
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
full-time for Dartmouth Hitchcock my My
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
Views are my own and and are informed by
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
14 years of practice here in the state I
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill unlike many of the
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
other medical providers you're going to
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
hear today I am not in the obstetrician
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
of any type I do not perform abortions I
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
do not counsel my patients either for or
 
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.670 align:start position:0%
do not counsel my patients either for or
against

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
abortion what I do as I tell my
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
8-year-old son is I'm a baby heart
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
doctor my official title is a pediatric
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
and Fetal cardiologist I'm a
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who can diagnose and treat
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
children who have heart disease
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
all the way down to those still in the
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
womb I refer those that need surgery to
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
a pediatric heart surgeon and I think
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
it'll help this group to understand how
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
my practice works the standard of
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
medical care for pregnant women is to
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
have an ultrasound performed by their OB
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
at 18 to 20 weeks of pre pregnancy
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
called an an an anatomy scan if the OB
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
has any reason to suspect or has already
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
found a heart problem they refer the
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
mother to me for a more a second and
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
more detailed
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
fetal echo cardiogram and ultrasound of
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
the heart it is usually performed at 21
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
to 23 weeks of
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
gation only 4% of abortions occur 16
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
weeks and later of those 3% occur 16 to
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
20 weeks and 1% after 21 weeks so why
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
does this bill Target them these
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
4% are my patients this bill unfairly
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
targets some some of them and will harm
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
some of them my patients need more than
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
15 weeks to identify the major fetal
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
anomalies that influence such impactful
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
decisions they rarely get this
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
information before 20 weeks the timing
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
of both the anatomy scan in the ob's
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
office and the fetal echocardiogram in
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
mind are hardcoded into our medical
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
system they are based on when we can
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
obtain the best images to get the best
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
data to get the best information to our
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
families so they can make these hard
 
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.270 align:start position:0%
families so they can make these hard
decisions

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
doing it earlier would result in
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
incomplete data and missed diagnosis and
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's only after these families have been
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
given this information that they can
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
make what we call an informed decision
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
about their own care this bill will
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
disrupt that personal and private
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
decision it will steal their autonomy it
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
will give it to the state this bill will
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
remove the informed from the informed
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
consent process it will insert a party
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
that has no place to make this type of
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
medical decision everyone has the right
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
to make their own informed decisions
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
about their own Medical Care medical
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
autonomy is a core principle of medical
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
ethics once I diagnose a fetus with a
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
heart job with a heart disease my job is
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
to give the parents information and
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
options during a consultation I cover an
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
enormous range of topics that I don't
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
have time in three minutes to cover
 
00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:28.150 align:start position:0%
have time in three minutes to cover
today

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
when my patients receive this they may
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
seek additional counsel from their
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
spouse or partner from their extended
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
family their support groups their
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
spiritual leaders their obstat other I'd
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you'd finish up okay I
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
will wrap up all of that takes
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
time in summary a reduction in the legal
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
limit from 24 to 15 weeks will harm the
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
very New Hampshire families who need our
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
help the most who are confronted with
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
the hardest medical decision they will

00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
the the challenges and the Heartbreak of
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancies and difficult
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances um we have been foster
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
parents my husband and I um and um we
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually my daughter is is adopted and
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
um that was the result of a decision her
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
birth mother made um after um actually
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
having an abortion the month before she
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
was conceived um and then when my the
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
birth her birth mother conceived her um
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
just felt
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
very um convicted to hry through with a
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and it has been a wonderful
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
relationship with um magdalen's birth
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
um obviously my husband and I are very
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
grateful for her decision um and um we
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
are there there are you know I know
 
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
adoption people have said like it's not
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
an option for everyone and they still
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
need to go through that pregnancy which
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
I know can be very difficult um but
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
adoption is a very real option there are
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
so many parents in the United States
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
today foster parents uh waiting for
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents who would be delighted
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
to adopt there are far more adoptive
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
parents waiting um than there are
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
children like that are being adopted out
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
so there there is we do have the
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
capacity um to receive and give children
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
homes and I know it's bigger than that
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
um but I would just like to to put that
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
down as well um and and thank you um I
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
simply observing but I will say that and
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for offering me seating room I
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the two kids um and now
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%

after Riley Ward um I see a couple of
 
00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:16.839 align:start position:0%
folks uh senior citizens like myself who
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
are standing in the back of the room and
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
if you plan to testify I'm going to ask
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
hello everyone my name is Riley Ward I
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
am 17 years old and I lived in Raymond
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my whole life I should be
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
at school today but with my mom's
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
permission I'm instead sitting here in
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
front of you because I believe I should
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
have the right to make decisions about
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
my own body and because the last time
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
this governing body passed an abortion
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
ban they told us 24 weeks is where they
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
would stop yet here I am
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
a 17-year-old girl sitting in front of
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
you asking you not to give up control of
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
my body but not to tighten your
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
grip I love this state my family is here
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
as well as many of my friends I may come
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire after college I
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
may not I don't know but I do know that
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
wherever my future takes me I want to be
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
in a place where I can control my own
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
body and control my own future my
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
friends who decide to stay in New
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and those I love who already
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
called New Hampshire Home deserve that
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
as well you all as politicians should
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
should not be the ones making decisions
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
about anyone's bodies there will be
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
always be there will always be things I
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
cannot control but I know I don't want
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
to be in a state where I can't control
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
my own body these decisions that you all
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
are making will have profound impacts on
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
my future as well as others Futures and
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%

aini
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
right sorry hi good morning I'm here to
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill my name is fidelma I'm
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
a certified nurse Midwife and I've been
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
working in reproductive health for 15
 
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
years and I have the privilege of
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
delivering babies at a hospital in New
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as working at a
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
quality Health Center taking care of
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
patients getting abortions when I think
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
about the founding of equality 50 years
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
ago on Main Street in the city's capital
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
and when I ask how it came to be people
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
often describe a very different
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
political climate where conservative
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
values were present along with
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
Progressive ones but legislating
 
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
Healthcare decisions was not a priority
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
for the government of New Hampshire I
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
know we find ourselves in a very
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
different political climate now but
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
we're still in New Hampshire and we as
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
Citizens still pride ourselves on small
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
government limited executive overreach
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
and Live Free or Die I believe in you as
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
state politicians and that you're here
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
to represent the values of GR Staters
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
not to advance a national political
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
agenda which introducing increasingly
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
limited destinational limit on abortions
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
is I believe you're here to fight for
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
the best possible outcomes for your
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
community and I know that your job is to
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
represent your constituents not to
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
understand all the ins and outs of a
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
very complicated medical condition
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's why so many of us are here as
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
midwives nurses and obes and
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
cardiologists the medical experts to
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
tell you this bill is wrong for New
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill would ban abortions
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
at 15 weeks before all the essential
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
prenatal testing is complete and before
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
most of the truly difficult and
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous complications of pregnancy
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
develop I have so many examples I wish I
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
could share with you to explain why this
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
bill is wrong from a busy single mother
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
whose hyperemesis gravidarum or
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
Relentless nausea and vomiting made her
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
daily existence torture and prevented
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
her from working to provide for her
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
three kids as well as playing with them
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
caring for them making them feel
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
treasured and loved as they deserved to
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
so many parents attempting to leave
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence situations and turn
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
their kids lives around or a young woman
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
with a new diagnosis of breast cancer
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
who has to choose between her welcomed
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
and desired pregnancy and her cancer
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
treatment none of these situations are
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
technically life-threatening but they
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
are danger Dangerous and health
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
threatening I could also tell you a
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
situations of uncertainty and fear where
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
a patient is bleeding and getting sicker
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
with a miscarriage but because the
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy still has a heartbeat we risk
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
delays in Essential Medical Care because
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
the healthcare team is uncertain in this
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
political climate what's allowed
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
emergent Medical Care being delayed
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
because we have allowed the government
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
to start dictating the decisions that
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
should be made by medical experts and
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
their patients also New Hampshire is a
 
01:00:56.109 --> 01:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
proudly rural State and I see many
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
patients traveling for over an hour or 2
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
hours to get their abortion care and a
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
15-week ban disproportionately affects
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
our rural communities who struggle
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
already with access to timely Healthcare
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
including a pregnancy diagnosis and I
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
know you are all here to fight for the
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
well-being of our citizens rural or
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
Urban and not to legislate barriers
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
against them now we live this every day
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
as medical experts in reproductive care
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
so it's our job to tell you that every
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is so different so in the best
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
interest of granite Staters we cannot
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
legislate Medical Care stand up and
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
defend New Hampshire's small government
 
01:01:28.029 --> 01:01:28.039 align:start position:0%
values Live Free or Die and leave these
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
excruciating and difficult decisions to
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%

started passing um you know we we were
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
watching and we thought about moving
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
back to Atlanta um or moving to the
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire and we chose the state for
 
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.150 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we chose the state for
a

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.630 align:start position:0%
a

Anon AR okay all right yes hi you are
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
correct thank you it's Laura El aam I
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
live in London Derry and I'm here in
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I understand some
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh back and forth about why it
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
may have been withdrawn but in general I
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
like to see New Hampshire moving in the
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
direction that this bill is headed and
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of reasons for that um
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
I heard someone say that we shouldn't be
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
pushing religious views on everybody
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
with uh laws like this and I just want
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
to point out that the fact that this
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about a h an human
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
individual in the womb isn't a religious
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
um opinion it it's just scientific and
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
biological fact from conception it's a
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
human entity it's um it's a developing
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
child it's not a clumb of cells um it is
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
a developing child and this is just
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
scientific fact a couple of weeks ago I
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to see my niece who
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
was eight weeks pregnant at the time and
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
she actually had an ultrasound video of
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
the twins that she's currently carrying
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're not Blobs of cells they're her
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to be her children they are
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
already her children and in this amazing
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
video you can see these two separate
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
entities with their little hearts
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
beating even at just 8 weeks
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would be important for
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
the for the Live Free or Die State since
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's been brought up a couple of times
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
to recognize the humanity and to work
 
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.750 align:start position:0%
to recognize the humanity and to work
towards

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
having a a cultural mindset that tries
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
to get us to save both lives there are a
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
lot of people who've distinguished
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
themselves with white coats and medical
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
equipment in this room who are telling
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
us about all the difficulties and
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
uncertainties they face when they're
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
trying to treat their patients um
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
I I think that once we begin to treat
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
both patients as actual human
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
individuals worthy of life then those
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
decisions will become easier because
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to affirmatively attempt
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
to save both lives in every instance and
 
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
um the more we can work towards that the
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
more Justice Society we will have the
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
Freer we'll be all be able to be and
 
01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
just one final quick Point um I'm the
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
mother of four adopted children I know a
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot of adults who were adopted as
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
children and that's not a bad outcome um
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
the parents of these children that were
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
adopted get to know that their their
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
children are growing up usually safe and
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
in a much better situation than dead um
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
right now there's about 2 million people
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
in the United in the United States
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
seeking children to adopt and there are
 
01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:39.710 align:start position:0%
seeking children to adopt and there are
about

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
120,000 children eligible to um for
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
adoption people go all over the world to
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
try to adopt children because it's a
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
good healthy life affirming choice and
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
um i' would like to see us just
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
recognize that imbalance here that there
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
are a lot of parents who would would
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
give loving homes to to the babies that
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
are currently being aborted thank you
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
very much thank you uh

committee thank you so much for having

me I'll read my written testimony and of
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
what going off script as much as
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
possible um my name is Dr Stephanie
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
harlo I am a board certified
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
pediatrician and a practicing OBGYN
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
resident physician at Dartmouth
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock in Lebanon I'm here speaking
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
today there are many aspects of this
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
bill that I believe would cause
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
gratuitous harm and suffering to New
 
01:06:46.559 --> 01:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
gratuitous harm and suffering to New
Hampshire

01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
families and I want to share a story
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
from actually when I was a Pediatrics
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
resident to exemplify that I remember
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
child I I cared for in my ped's
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
residency that was born with multiple
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
congenital anomalies a single fused eye
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
a fused nose and mouth failing kidneys
 
01:07:05.109 --> 01:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
and a liver so hard that it was
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
described as plastic he had tubes in
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
nearly every orifice of his body down
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
into his Airway into his esophagus
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
multiple out of his abdomen Ivy lines in
 
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.589 align:start position:0%
multiple out of his abdomen Ivy lines in
his

01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
arms every day that I rounded on him I
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
worried he was suffering
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
after living for a year in the hospital
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
like this he
 
01:07:32.589 --> 01:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
died his family was unable to keep
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
visiting him during much of that year
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
both because of their eventual need to
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
return to work and their need to care
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
for other
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
children one of my greatest fears with
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill is that we will be
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
forcing New Hampshire families into this
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
suffering the majority of fetal
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
anomalies are not diagnosed until 18 to
 
01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.190 align:start position:0%
anomalies are not diagnosed until 18 to
21

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
weeks with confirmation of complex
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
diagnoses often not being made until
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
even after
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
that while the bill describes exceptions
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
for fetal anomalies incompatible with
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
life this narrow definition would
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
exclude many anomalies which are
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
profoundly life-limiting and attribute a
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
suffering no law can account for the
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
Nuance of every
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
situation questions about complex
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy outcomes should only be
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
addressed by an expert
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
clinician who understands the
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
implications of a diagnosis and can
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
guide a family through challenging
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
questions to a decision that reflects
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
their values and minimizes
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
suffering additionally as has been
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
alluded to before this bill would harm
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
patients and families in New Hampshire
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
by making the state of New Hampshire
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
inhospitable to obstetric
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
Providers I am planning to continue my
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
training in Maternal Fetal Medicine
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
meaning I would care for highrisk
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
pregnancies I would be
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosing these severe anomalies and
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
having to turn patients
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
away that's against my code of ethics as
 
01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
away that's against my code of ethics as
a

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
clinician I also think waiting until
 
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
someone is near a life-threatening or
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
severe bodily harm injury is also
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
against my code of ethics as a physician
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
ma'am could I just ask you to wrap up
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
you're at the three point sure thank you
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
so much I won't go off script anymore um
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
just abortion is a a compassionate
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
procedure for people who are facing
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
unimaginable circumstances so thank you
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
for listening thank you very much next
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
is uh Erica Evers and on Deck will be uh
 
01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:48.550 align:start position:0%
is uh Erica Evers and on Deck will be uh

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
ciac good morning and thank you all for
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
letting me speak today my name is Dr
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
Erica iers and I'm an Obstetrics and
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
Gynecology resident physician I here
 
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
today to express my strong opposition to
 
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.430 align:start position:0%
today to express my strong opposition to
HB

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
476 there are many issues with this
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that my colleagues have
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
covered so eloquently but I want to
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
specifically bring to your attention the
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
problem that exists with the exemption
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
for medical
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
emergency let me give you an example of
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
how impossible it is to Def excuse me to
 
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
define life-saving or medical
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
emergency a patient who is 17 weeks
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
pregnant presents to an emergency room
 
01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
with a fever after breaking her water
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
this is known as pre-term premature
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
rupture of membranes and is something
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we see many times each year the
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
protective barrier between the outside
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
world and the inside of her uterus has
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
disappeared allowing bacteria to grow in
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
this moment she is stable but what
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
happens next is unpredictable it could
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
be a matter of hours or days before the
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
infection spreads throughout the whole
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
body but a life-threatening infection in
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
this scenario is absolutely preventable
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
before it progresses too far and becomes
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
fatal do I wait until her heart starts
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
racing the first signs her body is
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
trying to compensate for spreading
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
infection do you think a hospital lawyer
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
would feel I am legally protected to do
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
my job once her blood pressure starts to
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
drop and she becomes
 
01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
confused in no other context would a
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
doctor be waiting with the patient until
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
she needed to be sent to the ICU on life
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
support before they were allowed to do a
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
proced procedure that she needed to save
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
her life as a physician it is against my
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
code of ethics to delay care knowing the
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
risks to my patient when such
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
complications become severe enough to be
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
life-threatening permanent harm is often
 
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.910 align:start position:0%
life-threatening permanent harm is often
already

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
done these are the questions doctors and
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
states with medical emergency exceptions
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
are asking
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
themselves none of this ambiguity has
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
been clarified by the courts and there's
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
little to no legal precedent that exists
 
01:11:58.350 --> 01:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
doctors in these states are afraid to
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
treat their
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
patients in the hours it can take for an
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise healthy patient to become
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
unstable you want your doctor focused on
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
working alongside you in diagnosing and
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
treating your illness not contacting
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
Hospital lawyers and worried they may
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
face jail time thank you thank you very
 
01:12:22.830 --> 01:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
much uh K Kyrie ciac and next will be
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
very polish name my name is Kylie sislak
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
sislak I'm sorry please I'm going to
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
start off by saying that I am one of the
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
people I'm not sitting here in a white

coat um but I'm not a public speaker I'm

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm a critical care nurse here in New
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've recently just accepted a
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
position at a level one H uh hospital
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
here um I'm here to testify and oppose
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
against House Bill 476 and share the
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
harsh realities that healthcare workers
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
face when access to Safe legal abortion
 
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.390 align:start position:0%
face when access to Safe legal abortion
is

01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
denied I'd like to paint a picture of a
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
case that we're seeing all too commonly
 
01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
now a 28-year-old woman arriving to the
 
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
ER she's in severe abdominal pain she's
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
pale febrile hypotensive and
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
tartic desperate after escaping an
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
abusive relationship she attempted an at
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
home abortion at 15 weeks using
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
unregulated methods because surgical
 
01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
abortion was no longer an option in her
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
State she's bleeding heavily she has
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
signs of infection she's requiring blood
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
transfusions tests reveal uterine
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
perforation retained pregnancy tissue
 
01:13:45.239 --> 01:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
perforation retained pregnancy tissue
and

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
peritonitis despite ICU care she rapidly
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
declines into septic shock in organ
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
failure by the next day she developed
 
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.709 align:start position:0%
failure by the next day she developed
DIC

01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
DIC
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
and we exhaust all treatment options
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
with no family to notify holding her
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
hand the healthcare workers that care
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
for her have become her
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
family this is not just a fictional
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
story this is the tragic reality when
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
women are denied access to Safe legal
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
abortion care this death and so many
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
others that have already happened could
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
have been prevented with proper safe
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and support and while I
 
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
deeply respect and support anyone's
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
religious and philosophical
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
beliefs this bill is a legislative
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
matter that should rely on scientific
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
and medical evidence particularly
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
regarding what constitutes suffering and
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
quality of life medical decisions about
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
whether to continue a pregnancy in these
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances are deeply personal and
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
should be made by the patient in
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
consultation with their healthcare
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
provider and respectfully not by
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
lawmakers I strongly urge you to
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
consider the real human consequences of
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
restricting access to reproductive
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
Healthcare all throughout our country
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
women are dying when they do not have to
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
the United States has one of the highest
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rates in a developed
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
country black women being 2.6 times
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
higher than white our foster care system
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
is failing I'd like to recognize my

20121 that was a deeply personal
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
situation that I chose and it wouldn't
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
have led me to go on to serving my
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%

call me Miss Hill I'm here to humbly
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
476 there's been a recent Trend in
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
conservative politics that I advise
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
everyone to avoid you should not want to
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
be on the side of the developing Federal
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
Administration it's clung to power
 
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
through rage and violence and when it
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
goes out it will go the same way at such
 
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
a volatile point in American politics we
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
need protection real protection bills
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
like 476 charade as child care but
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're truly a sadistic and perverse
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
abuse of political power they are not
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
protection but domination and I
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
object restricting abortion does not
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
make happy nuclear families and a
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
flourishing population it breeds
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities for financial stress
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
Foster abuse and crime forcing someone
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
to bear and birth a child after an
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary deadline is nothing less than
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
ruthless and vindictive many people who
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
seek out an abortion do not have the
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
time and resources that you expect some
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
are abuse and incest victims with
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
limited information and freedom some are
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
bipolar or of mental conditions that
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
affect the safety of pregnancy but those
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
are not addressed in this bill some are
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
already parents of multiple children
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
without the time or money for a third or
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
fourth some are teenage students busy
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and scared and without a driver's
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
license you're assuming everyone can
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
find out their pregnant usually weeks
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
after fertilization suddenly decide if
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
they can raise a new human being through
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
adulthood and schedule pay for and
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
receive an abortion at a providing
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
clinic but these are Under Fire all
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
before the 15we gestational mark That's
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
not reasonable for everyone maybe it is
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
for you but I think people tend to
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
forget that you are not
 
01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
everyone your lives may be more
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
predictable with backup plans and a
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
guest room with saving account and a
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
401k this isn't true for every
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
American to me actual protection is
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
sacrificing something to keep other
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
people from harm what they recognize as
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
harm what has actually hurt them in the
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
past you do this so they have freedoms
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
and rights a fulfilling life and agency
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
where they can choose what they think is
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
best for them even if you don't like
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
that choice that's real protection and
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
we need it now now more than ever you
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
trusted us to elect our officials why
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
not trust us with our own lives our own
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
families and leave a reasonable time
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
frame to do so that's the end of my
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
will never regret focusing on saving
 
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
lives I agree with that there are a lot
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
of people in this room who work in
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
Healthcare who have dedicated their
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
lives to the profession of learning how
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
best to save lives and I would implore
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
the committee to listen to
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
them we are trying to do the right thing
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and if indeed as a society our goal is
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
to save
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
lives I would pay attention to how many
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
people are here talking about their
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
experiences working in the actual Health
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
Care System the Health Care system as
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
probably we all know is is fairly broken
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's increasingly complex there are so
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
many factors that interfere with
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
Healthcare provider's ability to deliver
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
the best the most compassionate and
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care unnecessary
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
legislation should never be in another
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
barrier between the care that we as
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
Physicians are able to provide to our
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
patients and their
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
families every healthc care provider
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
that works in this room I'm sure can
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
come up with multi multiple recent or
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
past examples of patients who they have
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
personally cared for whose individual
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
stories um and individual scenarios
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
would have caused them to suffer greatly
 
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:09.639 align:start position:0%
because of a bill like
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
this senate committee members in States
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
like Idaho like Texas who have passed
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
abortion banss that are similar to this
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
have had to learn the hard way that
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
these bills cause doctors to leave the
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
state these bills cause rural delivery
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery units to close down
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
they cause patients to travel out of
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
state to receive necessary care these
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
bills cause patients to sue their state
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
governments based on their inability to
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
access that care they cause psychologic
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
harm and they can cause
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
death all of the Physicians and healthc
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
care providers here today are taking
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
time away from our patients we're
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
cancelling our clinics we are coming to
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
the state house after overnight shifts
 
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
we are speaking up from retirement
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
because we collectively recognize the
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
imminent disaster that this bill
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
represents for families of New Hampshire
 
01:22:00.669 --> 01:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
and for the medical landscape at
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
large please vote against this Bill
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much ma'am uh Courtney
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
Hastings hey I'm Dr Courtney nil I'm a
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
practicing OBG on here in conquer
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
abortion care is an entirely necessary
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
aspect of healthcare the circumstances
 
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
surrounding abortions are vast and there
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
should should not be judicial claim over
 
01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
an individual's Healthcare choices no
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
matter those
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances being pregnant is more
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous than not being pregnant or of
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
having an abortion a woman should not be
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
required to take on this deadly risk if
 
01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's not desired additionally I'm
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
exceptionally concerned about the
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
verbiage in this bill which references
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
criminal action against healthcare
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
providers who manage abortion care the
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
line between abortion and management of
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
spontaneous miscarriage between women
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
when a woman's life is endangered or not
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
is truly momentary and ambiguous
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
there are not always moments of saving
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
both lives these moments can be the
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
difference in life or death for a
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
patient and laws like this are set to
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
elicit fear amongst doctors and thus
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
delay care due to worries about
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
retribution which can destroy one's long
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
worked for career a career built around
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
helping others and protecting the health
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
of women to put this in the context of
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
your work as a lawmaker instead of mine
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
as a doctor consider if you were to be
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
asked to come to a decision on a bill in
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
a matter of minutes without any
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues to debate it with without any
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
constituents to weigh in your choice
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
alone and let's make it 4:00 a.m. hour
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
22 of your shift cuz that's what our
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
world is like by supporting the bill a
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
woman and the fetus as it's
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
parasitically connected to the woman's
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
life will die and by opposing you may
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
undergo a lengthy criminal investigation
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
and risk Financial personal and
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
professional ruin even if ultimately
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's found that you did act
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately this is the decision
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking us to make regularly if
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
this bill were to become a law and one I
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
suspect none of you would be interested
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
in making were those really the stakes
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
on behalf of patients and providers
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
alike please oppose this Bill thank you
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Charlotte
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
banister hi hello um members of the
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
House Judiciary Committee uh my name is
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
Dr Charlotte Hastings and when I'm not
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
on crutches I'm a practicing OBGYN in
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I sit before for you today
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
in strong opposition to HB
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
476 prior to working in New Hampshire I
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
briefly trained as an obn in Dallas
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
Texas at one of the busiest hospitals in
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
the country we were not able to offer
 
01:24:40.109 --> 01:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
abortions except in the case of lethal
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
anomalies or significant risk to the
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
life of the mother I can assure you
 
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
those limitations did not protect the
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
fetus or the mother they instead limited
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
the reproductive choices of
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
well-informed women and muddied the
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
waters in terms of the safe
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based care that we as
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
Physicians were able to provide I cared
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
for 11 and 12 year-olds who were forced
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
to carry a pregnancy to term not
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
surprising many many of those fifth and
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
sixth graders didn't know they were
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
pregnant until after 15 weeks I was
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
forced to watch as women came to the
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
emergency department with pain and
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
bleeding secondary to ectopic
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancies implanted in their C-section
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
scars these women were at risk of their
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
uteruses rupturing and potentially dying
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
but didn't yet meet the level of
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
significant risk to the life of the
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
mother and therefore no intervention was
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
allowed and we had to turn them away
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
instead of providing the potentially
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
life-saving care that existed in other
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
states one patient of mine broke her
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
water at 19 weeks and instead of being
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
offered an abortion given that her fetus
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
was non-viable an option she requested
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
she was forced to undergo a delivery
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
following her delivery she had excessive
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
bleeding and as she was wheeled back to
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
the o I watched as her husband held a
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
gasping dying neonate not capable of
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
living outside the uterus my patient
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately required an emergent
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy and was never able to carry
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
another baby she was 19 years old I can
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
only imagine the trauma that she and her
 
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
husband live with after that experience
 
01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
these laws have real consequences I left
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
Texas because I felt I wasn't training
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
in a location where I could provide the
 
01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:23.719 align:start position:0%
safe evidence-based care that I knew
 
01:26:26.189 --> 01:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
existed and as a result was limiting my
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
abilities and the safety of my patients
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
I came to New Hampshire because I knew
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'd be able to provide that care this
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
bill brings me back to my days in Texas
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
I hope you will oppose House Bill 476
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
and allow us to provide the care that
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
the women of New Hampshire need and
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
deserve thank you thank you uh next
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
Kristen banister and on Deck will be
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
hi my name's Dr Kristen banister and
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
I've been a practicing OBGYN in New
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 24
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
years um as you consider House Bill 476
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that you all
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
understand kind of what happens in the
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
first 20 weeks of pregnancy the first
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
visit around 8 weeks consists of
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
ordering lab work discussing future
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
tests and visits but no ultrasound at 12
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
weeks we do the first alter sound and
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
offer blood test to screen for
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
chromosomal problems the results usually
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
take about 2 weeks to come back so now
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
we're at around 14 weeks if the test is
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
positive for a chromosomal problem the
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
patient will be referred to a specialist
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
to discuss further testing assuming
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
there are no unexpected results from the
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
early testing the next major visit is at
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
20 weeks with the anatomic ultrasound
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
this is the ultrasound that shows us how
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
the fetus has developed are there any
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
major malformations or concerning
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
findings all of the testing that we do
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
in pregnancy takes time and it is not
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
until 20 to 22 weeks at the earliest
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
that we have the information need to say
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
that a pregnancy is healthy or not I
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
hope you can understand why 15 weeks is
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
too early for an abortion restriction
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire allows abortion
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
hair up until 24 weeks unless there's a
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
threat to the mother's life or a fetus
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
with an anomaly considered incompatible
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
with life at the time of that vote you
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
heard concerns from my professional
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
Community about the ambiguity of these
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
terms we have seen the consequences and
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
of the confusing language in the other
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
states as you've heard from the previous
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh providers women are dying from
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
abortion bans this is avoidable and 100%
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
stems from abortion restrictions vague
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
terminology and the threat of legal
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
repercussions for providers the other
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
phenomenon we're seeing in states that
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
are tightening restrictions is that
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
OBGYN do not want to practice there
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
they're relocating and recruitment is
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
difficult this is not just an a loss of
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
abortion providers but your obstetric
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
providers your infertility Specialists
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
and your gynecologic surgeons in short
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
restricting abortion care compromises
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
the overall quality of Women's Health
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
Care the final issue I want to address
 
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
is as you consider house build 476 is
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
the exception for conditions
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life where is that
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
line for example if feet is found to
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
have spinal muscular atrophy will be
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
born alive and may live several years
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
but they will slowly Lo lose muscle tone
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
becoming unable to move and eventually
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
no no longer able to breathe is that
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
considered incompatible with life how
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
long does a baby need to live to count
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
an hour a month a year 5 years does
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
quality of life matter there's no
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
clearcut to this answer to this
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
Physicians are trained to manage these
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
complex difficult problems and can still
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
struggle with what incompatible with
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
life means legislators should not be
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
trying to make it a legal standard my
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
request is that you vote to allow
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
patients and their Physicians to work
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
through the medical issues of pregnancy
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
without the pressure of a 15we deadline
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
families need solid information support
 
01:29:50.189 --> 01:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
they need time to process so they can
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision that is right
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
for them please do not erode the quality
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
of Women's Healthcare in New Hampshire
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
by unnecessarily your time is up could I
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
ask you to please uh finish up um we do
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
not want to increase our maternal death
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
rates and we don't want to see a
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
migration of Physicians out of our state
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
please vote against thank you very much
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%

McLoud

01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Lori KY and I thank you all
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
for being here and for having me um I'm
 
01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to House Bill
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
476 this bill puts unnecessary burden on
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and seeks to
 
01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
redefine the terms fetus and late term
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
abortion so that they are not in line
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
with the science behind pregnancy I want
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
to ask did any of the authors of this
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
bill actually speak to an OBGYN or visit
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
Google before they wrote this bill when
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
any group of politicians starts making
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
false assumptions about the science
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
behind pregnancy we all know that that
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
is a way to impose their religious
 
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
values on people who have the
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional right freedom of
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
religion not the politicians
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
religion I know we all know this but
 
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes it needs to be said out loud
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
what the authors of this bill are also
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
doing is trying to sprinkle in wording
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
about fetal personhood that prioritizes
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy over the Pres pregnant
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
person I believe people who can get
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant would choose to have more
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
babies if New Hampshire started
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
prioritizing the pregnant person and the
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
children and life they already
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire residents need bills
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
that will help us in our daily lives
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
such as food prices gas prices education
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care taxes
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
taxes um so why are we starting here at
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this um legislative
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
session with an abortion
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
ban it's disgusting it has zero to do
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
understand

01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about now the uh
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
mandatory obstetric
 
01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
ultrasounds first who will be
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying for this
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
procedure that is going to be forced on
 
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
women by the
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
government I didn't see that in the bill
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
either second are the gentlemen
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for drafting this bill at
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
least a little bit familiar with what an
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
obstetric ultrasound is well Google is
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
free and I will start I will offer the
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
drafters of this bill the name of an
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
excellent OBGYN here in New Hampshire or
 
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
even in this
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
room that can help you with that concept
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the authors of this bill
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
make no exceptions for rape or or incest
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
is inhumane unconscionable and proves to
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
me the religiosity origins of the bill
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
to begin with ladies and gentlemen New
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not living in the
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
handmaid's tail yet and I intend on
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
being here at the state house every time
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
Daniel McLoud the fourth uh followed on
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%

01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%

good morning committee and uh fellow New

Hampshire residents my name is Miss
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
Aurora weatherbe I'm a resident of Derry
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and have been for all of
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
the nearly 23 years of my life and I'm
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
here to testify against House Bill
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
476 HP 476 seeks to limit access to
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
necessary Medical Care not only does it
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
lower the term limit for abortion
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
significantly moving from 24 weeks to
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
only 15 but more frighteningly it does
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
not provide exceptions in the case of
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
rape or incest to be very clear under
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
this proposed law people can be forced
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
to carry two term pregnancies that
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
resulted from a rape worse yet they can
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
be forced to carry to term pregnancies
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
resulting from incest proponents of this
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill May say that in such cases those
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
people should simply receive an abortion
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
before 15 weeks yet this argument does
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
not take into account that many
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
incestuous and rape pregnancies are
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
coerced many times in these cases the
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
victim is impregnated against their own
 
01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
will and afterwards coerced to keep that
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
child out of fear of Retribution from an
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
abusive partner this would include cases
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
of marital rape meaning abusive husbands
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
could force their wives to undergo the
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
traumatic process of carrying and
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
birthing an unwanted child all the while
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
suffering from continued abuse at the
 
01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
hands of their
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
husband most frighteningly of all this
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
bill proposes a breach of patient
 
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
confidentiality for ing certain medical
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
procedures and their circumstances to be
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
reported to the Department of Health and
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services a department I will note
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
which was not listed in the contacted
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
agencies of the original draft of the
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill something which should be
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
incredibly concerning why is the
 
01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
who will be directly involved with the
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this bill not
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is by far the most dangerous piece
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill New Hampshire is a state of
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die and this state
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
certainly does not promote living free
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
and I think that only leaves one other
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
option in that motto now doesn't it as a
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
as a resident of Derry I would
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
specifically like to call out one of the
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill I don't know if
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%

01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
constituents I must say I'm frankly
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
ashamed to be represented by one of the
 
01:40:54.669 --> 01:40:54.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill all right um I
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%

to be from New Hampshire I love this
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
state but what I and so many others love
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
about this state is our freedom I'll say
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
it again our motto is Live Free or Die
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that's supposed to represent the

ideals of our people and this bill goes
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%

uh regardless of uh the bill being
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
withdrawn it means a lot to the people
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
in this room regardless of what side of
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
the bill you're on so thank you uh for
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
having us today um I just want to use my
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
time today to talk a little bit about
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
General Health Care um unfortunately
 
01:42:12.669 --> 01:42:12.679 align:start position:0%
Healthcare delivery is really in a tough
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
spot right now uh you have all seen the
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
headlines uh if you have received Health
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
Care in the last few months or few years
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know it is hard it is expensive it
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
can be extremely frustrating to get
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
health care for you or your loved ones
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
and there are many factors in play um
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
factors that none of us in this room are
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to be able to solve overnight we
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
know that these are much bigger than us
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
um but at planed Parenthood Northern New
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
England and in a postro world uh we as
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
an organization are incredibly Nimble
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to respond to
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
patients needs especially in the last
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
few years so I just want to give one
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
example um we recently be began to offer
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
new service in
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester um and that is vasectomies uh
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
interest in vasectomies
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed after Rowell um and that
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed that interest has
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
continued to grow uh thousands of
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
granite Staters come to us every year
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
hundreds every week and they come to us
 
01:43:14.189 --> 01:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
because we are able to adapt and change
 
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
needs in this uh interesting time for
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare in this difficult time for
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
our Healthcare we are able to adapt
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
patient needs uh we work through the
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
challenges we work for the be barers we
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
can still a we can still offer
 
01:43:28.910 --> 01:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
affordable health care it's timely and
 
01:43:31.229 --> 01:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
compassionate and it's award-winning and
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
you don't have to take my word for it
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
because one in five American women have
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
been to a Planned Parenthood uh at some
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
point in her life
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
so why in this extremely precarious time
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
in healthare would the state make it
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
harder for us to provide health care
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
because that's what this bill does uh it
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
makes the health care situation worse
 
01:43:52.109 --> 01:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
this bill has no purpose there's no
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
scientific or medical justification for
 
01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
this arbitrary cutoff line 15 weeks is
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
months before the point of viability
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
which was recognized in decades of
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
medical research and referenced by the
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and it does nothing but
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
put a barriers for granite Staters and
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
it prohibits highly qualified and
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
trained providers at hospitals and at
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire abortion clinics from
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
offering this care this bill is harmful
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and deeply unpopular and I
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
want to thank this committee again for
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawing this bill and I'm happy to
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
all right any questions for this witness
 
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much um next
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
is Christina warer and on Deck will
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
Aaron seamons I hope I got that right or
 
01:44:41.669 --> 01:44:41.679 align:start position:0%
yes Aaron Seaman I believe yes please go
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
ahead ma'am thank you chairman and
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
members of the House Judiciary Committee
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Christina
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
Warner and I serve as the New Hampshire
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
state director for Reproductive Equity
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
now and I will be speaking in opposition
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
to house bill 476 it is undeniable from
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
the abundance of testimony you have
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
heard including over 11,000 signin in
 
01:45:01.589 --> 01:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
opposition to this proposal that this
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
ban on abortion at 15 weeks is out of
 
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
line with granted State values today I
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
want to Echo the concerns brought up by
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
providers and patients and we'll focus
 
01:45:11.589 --> 01:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
my testimony on uplifting the evidence
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
we've seen on the harm to patients a
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill like this poses and the negative
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
maternal Health outcomes it would cause
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
a recent propublica investigation
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
examined the impacts of strict abortion
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
bans in States across the country it
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
found that in states with bands pregnant
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
women have bled to death contracted
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
sepsis and faced other serious infection
 
01:45:30.589 --> 01:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
risks while waiting for providers
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
uncertain about their authority to offer
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
legal care as you've heard time and time
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
again this morning women are dying due
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the impacts of abortion banss with
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
similar exceptions for medical
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
emergencies as are proposed in HB 476
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
these heartbreaking stories clearly
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that in practice abortion
 
01:45:48.350 --> 01:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
banss that include medical exceptions do
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
not work there is no and there will
 
01:45:52.109 --> 01:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
never be a universal definition of the
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
distinct point at a pregnant person's
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
life becomes endangered research also
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
shows that states with abortion bands
 
01:45:59.229 --> 01:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
pose a direct threat to maternal Health
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
outcomes states with bands are more
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
likely to have fewer maternity care
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
providers more deserts for maternity
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
care higher rates of maternal mortality
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
and infant death and higher overall
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
death rates for women of reproductive
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
age these findings should be of major
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
concern to the legislature which has
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
taken significant action in the past few
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
years to make progress on maternal and
 
01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:23.719 align:start position:0%
infant Health outcomes the passage of HB
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
476 would be in direct opposition to the
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan progress achieved for New
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire moms and families through 2023
 
01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:31.639 align:start position:0%
is momni bus and the potential success
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
of this session's babus 2.0 in closing
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is out of line with Granite
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
State values puts women and mothers at
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
risk and would imperal our state's
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
fragile maternal Health ecosystem
 
01:46:43.149 --> 01:46:43.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
women and families that abortion is safe
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
and legal in our state globally the
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
frequency of abortion is not correlated
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
by availability or legality which means
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
bands do not decrease abortion rates
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
they just make pregnancy more dangerous
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the country we have seen that
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
states with the strictest abortion laws
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
have the highest rates of maternal
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
deaths every pregnancy and every person
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
are unique and different and there is
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
simply no possible way to anticipate
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
every situation where a pregnant person
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
finds themselves making the incredibly
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
personal decision to seek an abortion
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy can be complicated it is not a
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
health neutral state in fact the most
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous time in a person's life is
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
while they're pregnant it is
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
unpredictable when abortion care may be
 
01:48:24.669 --> 01:48:24.679 align:start position:0%
needed even in a plan and wanted
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but in states with gational
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
banss it gets confusing what's
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
constitutes a maternal Health exemption
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
who decides this does the hospital
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee have to be woken up in
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night to weigh in on
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
this decision does a judge have to be
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
contacted to declare that a person's
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
life is in danger how long does it take
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
how dead do they have to be have you
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
ever sat with a patient who was bleeding
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
out losing a desired pregnancy and
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
risking their own life and not being
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
able to do anything about it while their
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
providers scramble around to figure out
 
01:48:58.109 --> 01:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
if they can act how hopeless and
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
terrifying that is I have uncertainty
 
01:49:04.109 --> 01:49:04.119 align:start position:0%
causes delays in care and at no point in
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy are politicians better experts
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
than a patient and their provider to
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
make these tough decisions abortion is
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
healthare it is common and it is
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep abortion easily
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
accessible and safe for the health of
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
all Granite Staters thank you thank you
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
very much um yeah um I'm sorry could I
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
ask a question of you of course uh thank
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
you for U letting me do that several
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
people have thanked this committee for
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the bill but my
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that is not an
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
accurate statement I understand that the
 
01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.229 align:start position:0%
accurate statement I understand that the
prime

01:49:43.229 --> 01:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:49:46.510 --> 01:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor has asked to withdraw the bill
 
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
but the bill is in fact before this
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
committee the committee has taken no AC
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
action and I don't think can take any
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
action since our obligation is to hold a
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
hearing um and follow procedures once a
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill has been filed and therefore um to
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
say that the committee has withdrawn the
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill is inaccurate am am I wrong on that
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
I think you're correct on that the as as
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
I said before as I understand the
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
procedure the bill is before this
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee um if if the prime sponsor and
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
all the co-sponsors want to withdraw it
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
at this stage
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
um uh that can only be done when if the
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
house votes to accept a withdrawal but
 
01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
the bill you're you're correct it's Bill
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
is still before this committee but so
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
meanwhile there'd be no reason for us
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
not to finish this hearing finish that
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
open and hold the hearing on the non
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
gerain uh Amendment and then in fact for
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote on the non gerain
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the bill well that there
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
we will certainly hold a hearing on the
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
non- gerain amendment uh in terms of
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
voting on the bill um I I'm I'm not so
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
sure about that um but but you're right
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
we could do that I don't dispute that we
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
could do that whether we will or not
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen thank you very much
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
one I'm sorry did somebody yeah I think
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn had a question too I was just
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask uh with regard to to uh
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's comments the one
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
thing I heard that I wanted to to be
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
crystal clear on uh because I had
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
understood from listening to the start
 
01:51:32.510 --> 01:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
of this hearing that while of course the
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
withdrawal is not within our purview
 
01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
that that goes to house session day that
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
this is reported as being a desire not
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
merely of the Prime sponsor but of all
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsors is is that correct my my
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
understanding my understanding is that
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
in order for a bill to be withdrawn even
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
when it can be done without it having to
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
go to the house for a vote and there is
 
01:52:00.069 --> 01:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
some time period I think maybe it's
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
before the bill has been scheduled for a
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the prime sponsor and all the
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors May withdraw the bill yeah
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
just on their own I'm with you on the
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
house rule I'm just simply asking
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
whether we know uh whether the other
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors are of similar mind to the
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor my understanding is that
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
they are but um I'll the other
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors have signed
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
off and representative kutab did you
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
have something you all right all right
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
so Matthew uh Bean beam I'm sorry and on
 
01:52:42.510 --> 01:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
wolper good morning thank you for having
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
me sure my name is Matthew beam I'm a
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
resident of
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
samton uh I'm also an ordain Minister uh
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
which appears to put me at a
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in this
 
01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.069 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in this
debate

01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just going to speak more
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
generally here on abortion just for the
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
record I guess I was just asked to speak
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of days ago my views on this
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
topic have evolved over time and uh I
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
certainly can't claim to have any moral
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
High Ground in any of this I'm just a
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
guy in search of the truth like
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
you I do know uh I've been thinking
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
about human history a lot lately and
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
there have been times in human history
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
when those who had power were able to
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
oppress or exterminate another group of
 
01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
people and one of the ways they were
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
able to do this was to classify that
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
group of people as not fully
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
human American slaveholders could do
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
what they did because Africans were
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
classified as not fully
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
human the Nazis could do what they did
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
because they reclassified the Jewish
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
people as not fully
 
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
human and I see us doing it
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
again um there's an old quote attributed
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
to Mark Twain which says history doesn't
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
repeat itself but it often Rhymes um so
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear here I'm not saying
 
01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
that people are Nazis or that they're
 
01:54:07.229 --> 01:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
like slaveholders I'm just saying that
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
history has recurring patterns and we
 
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
tend to be shortsighted and I'm seeing
 
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.790 align:start position:0%
tend to be shortsighted and I'm seeing
it

01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:15.629 --> 01:54:15.639 align:start position:0%
today uh I think one day history is
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
going to come back around on this just
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
like it has in the
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
past one day these babies will win the
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
fight for human rights probably not
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
today based on what I'm hearing maybe
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
not in 50 years but one day they
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
will I realize it's not politically
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
expedient for most of you to pass a bill
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
like this um it was not politically
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
expedient to speak up for the rights of
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
Africans in the 1800s and it was not
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
politically expedient to speak up for
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
the rights of Jews in Germany in the
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
40s but uh I remind you that your public
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
office isn't merely about political
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
expediency it is about what's doing
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
what's right in the long
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
term these are human beings I think most
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%

of the
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
table I I sit here I'd say I stand here
 
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm here today to say this I serve
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
the Living God the creator of the
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
universe The Giver of
 
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
Life and the only owner of every life
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
that he creates God loves everyone of
 
01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.069 align:start position:0%
that he creates God loves everyone of
his

01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
creatures the Supreme
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
Court not not what I'd call a religious
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
organization when the issue of the
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
famous Infamous which I started that
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
year on Ro versus Wade
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
decision did so on the basis of the
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
inability to tell
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
what the object of the abortion
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
was they claimed they could not identify
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
when human life began and consequently
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
they would say you can do abortion today
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
we can identify
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
when we know very precisely in a b
 
01:56:44.350 --> 01:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
biological way when it
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
begins according to the Supreme Court in
 
01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
1973 if we knew
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
that abortion would already be
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional under the 14th Amendment
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
of the United States
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution but they said we're not
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
going there and they
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
didn't medical
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
ethics So today we're
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
here medical ethics up until the the
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
abortion era
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
prohibited any abortive Fati or any
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
practitioner of healthcare from
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
assisting in any way in the death of a
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
pre-born child they prohibited it of
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
course they had to change the hypocritic
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
go to line with what you want to call
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
current practice and so it has been
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
changed and most of the providers that
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard talk
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
today never heard of that orth never
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
took that oath but they all used
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
to we've heard a lot about mental heal
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
maternal health care I don't know what's
 
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
wrong with the Medical Health Care
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
system of the United States what I do
 
01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:52.910 align:start position:0%
system of the United States what I do
know

01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
is that in countries like England and
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
Sweden and France and many others in the
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
European region and around the
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
world where the standard for abortion
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
care is 15 weeks or
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
less have higher maternal success rates
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
lower M maternal mortality than in the
 
01:58:17.639 --> 01:58:18.830 align:start position:0%
lower M maternal mortality than in the
United

01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
United
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
States so if in fact the these
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
laws do increase inter uh maternal
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
mortality I'm thinking the problem is
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
with the health care system and not with
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
the law because your your time limit is
 
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
up I'd ask you if you could finish up
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
please thank
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
you abortion is a temporary a permanent
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
solution to a temporary problem it
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
should be under the Constitution and
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
illegal I urge you to support the Bill
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank thank you very much
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%

holistic health center um I've come here
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
today to tell you that I almost didn't
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
exist um The Story Goes that my father
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
had a previous marriage before he
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
married my mother um they were married
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
she wanted children and after marrying
 
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
they saw those two pink lines so when my
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
mother went to tell my father that she
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
was pregnant um she was met with anger
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
betrayal h how could you do this to me
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
um he was scared he had a lot of fear he
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
was scared that he couldn't be a good
 
02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
father scared that he wouldn't be enough
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
scared to bring a baby into the world
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
after the marriage you know his first
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
marriage wasn't successful um so after
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
that reaction my mother in obedience to
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
my father said I'll go find out so she
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
went she went to the clinic and she
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
found out um she gathered information
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
pamphlets brochures she was educated on
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
what would happen What To Expect and she
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
left that clinic and she went to my
 
02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
father and she said I'm so sorry I don't
 
02:00:28.030 --> 02:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
know where this leaves our marriage but
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
I cannot do it so she spent the next
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
nine months of her pregnancy um with her
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
husband not acknowledging her pregnancy
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um she says that he didn't
 
02:00:42.030 --> 02:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it until I was on my way out
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
but I did come out I showed up into the
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
world and do you want to know what
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
happened he fell in love like all
 
02:00:51.629 --> 02:00:51.639 align:start position:0%
parents do in their own way he fell in
 
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
love with me and he forgot all that fear
 
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
and all the doubt and all his upset I
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
became his world and he raised me to be
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
a strong resilient woman with a tackle
 
02:01:04.069 --> 02:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
anything attitude I lived every day
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
feeling cherished and loved now I have
 
02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
three beautiful children of my own but
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
what if what if he had been stronger in
 
02:01:14.069 --> 02:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
his convictions or my mother had been
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
weaker what if she had said yes in the
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
clinic that day the answer I wouldn't be
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
here and the countless lives that I've
 
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
touched in my nursing business business
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
my family life my friends who have
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
reached out when they needed a shoulder
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
to cry on would all be worse off for me
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
not being here and it doesn't just stop
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
there the killing of a baby in the womb
 
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't just stop at that one fetus the
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
baby in the womb is full of potential
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
and what ifs if my mother had said yes
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
my own children wouldn't exist and how
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
those children have impacted lives in a
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
positive way already in their short life
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's the thing um you know the light
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
that lives in people's Souls has
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
positive Ripple effects on an infinite
 
02:01:57.069 --> 02:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
number of people and things can you
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
think of a single person that you know
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
who has never had a single positive
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
impact on anyone or anything in their
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
whole lives the answer is of course no
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's an
 
02:02:08.639 --> 02:02:10.470 align:start position:0%
it's an
impossibility

02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
impossibility
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
alternately if my mother had said yes to
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
abortion that yes would have left a dark
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
mark and an abusive mark on my mother's
 
02:02:19.709 --> 02:02:19.719 align:start position:0%

Kylie Bearer from someone from
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
Bedford please go ahead sir oh thank you
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
so uh I just wanted to relay my
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
experiences so when my wife was pregnant
 
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
with her first son uh she began to make
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of predictions about his
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
personality and how he would be and and
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
like really specific things uh like what
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
foods he liked and how active he was if
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
you liked to dance like all all these
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of things needless to say I
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
thought it was bunk I just thought she
 
02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
was I just thought she was um just being
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
silly but uh after he was born and after
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
he started to grow up I saw all of her
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
predictions come true and what
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
is especially pertinent here is that the
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
prediction started when she was about
 
02:03:46.030 --> 02:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
like 12 in between 12 and 16 weeks so
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
like 12 13 14 weeks and so um based on
 
02:03:53.069 --> 02:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
that based on my experience is you know
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
I would say that a fetus even that young
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh is not just some unfeeling organism
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
it is a person and its life shouldn't be
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
forfeit so easily now in regards to the
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
medical providers that have all come out
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh I would just say that if you feel
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
that strongly the thrust of these laws
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
is mainly against unnecessary abortions
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
obviously medical necessary things are
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
medically necessary and so if you feel
 
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
that strongly about it what I would
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
suggest you do is just write up your own
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines for
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
what exceptions should be made because
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
the legislators don't know they don't
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
know your profession so why don't you
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
guide them through it and then you might
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with a more
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh solution to a problem
 
02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
that's obviously very divisive that's
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
what I have to say thank you very much
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir um again K

Klean hi good morning morning my name is
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
Carly fines I'm 28 years old and my
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
residence in Hometown is Bedford New
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm from a family of Jewish
 
02:05:23.069 --> 02:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
doctors in reformed Judaism we are
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
taught that life begins at Birth I
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
repeat myself birth not conception if
 
02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.430 align:start position:0%
repeat myself birth not conception if
anything

02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
anything happens that puts the mother in
 
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
danger rape incest fatal fetal anomaly
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
septic uterus cancer miscarriage any of
 
02:05:40.159 --> 02:05:41.069 align:start position:0%
septic uterus cancer miscarriage any of
that

02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
happens in reformed Jewish law we are
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
taught that she has the option if not
 
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
the obligation to save herself and
 
02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
terminate the fetus especially in
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
scenarios where she already has children
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
postpartum that she has obligations to
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
either way she regardless of decision
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
and outcome she has spared any and all
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
judgment from or vilification from her
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
peers her as is her
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
doctor the that's the main problem with
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
these abortion laws and restrictions
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
medical events like which like the
 
02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
forces of nature have their own timeline
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
they don't care about human-made laws so
 
02:06:23.229 --> 02:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
something can go wrong long after the
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
15we deadline and it could turn a
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
miracle into a
 
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
tragedy it's if if you choose to vote
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
Yes on this bill please note that what
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
you are doing is hermetically sealing
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
off the emergency exit and taking away
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
resources from women who really need it
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
I certainly would not go into an
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
abandoned building because it isn't safe
 
02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
and I certainly would not jump out of a
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
plane without a parachute for that exact
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
same reason as reformed Jews our orders
 
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
are go forth and multiply why how are we
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that if we're not
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
safe this is the main reason I'm
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
choosing to remain childree because
 
02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and and motherhood in America
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
is just not safe or sustainable anymore
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
I repeat myself if you care about life
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
at all you would vote no on this bill I
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
will not be taking questions thank you
 
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%

Sergeant do you have written
 
02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
well hi hi um my name is Francis ker and
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm from Bo um so I um I'm here in
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to the proposed legislation
 
02:07:44.589 --> 02:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm registered nurse I've been
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
working for uh 44 years taking care of
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
patients and um this ban will definitely
 
02:07:51.079 --> 02:07:52.709 align:start position:0%
patients and um this ban will definitely
harm

02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
harm
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
women and I don't speak um H in
 
02:07:58.589 --> 02:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals um I speak in reality and
 
02:07:58.599 --> 02:07:59.750 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals um I speak in reality and
with

02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
experience um I would also like to bring
 
02:08:06.189 --> 02:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
to your attention that not every child
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
adoptable um I I work at a safety net
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh I am that person that cares
 
02:08:17.229 --> 02:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
unadoptable um people with devastating
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
intellectual and phys physical
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities when they come into the
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
hospital um I also take care of these
 
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
children when they are no longer
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
children when they're in their 60s and
 
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
70s and their parents are dead and they
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
have no one um it would be nice if
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
people would adopt these people but they
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
usually don't um unfortunately that's
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
reality um women need the freedom to
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
consult with their Physicians and health
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
care providers to discuss medical
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
options then they need to have the
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
freedom to make the choices that are
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
right for them as
 
02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
individuals um secondly I'm here as a
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
mother and a grandmother to protect the
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
rights of my daughters and
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
granddaughters um they are afraid that
 
02:09:10.430 --> 02:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
they might need medical care and might
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
not be able to get the care that they
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
need um my 11-year-old granddaughter
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
Natalya asked me to be here today to
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
protect her
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
rights um one of my daughters is a
 
02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.030 align:start position:0%
rights um one of my daughters is a
surgeon

02:09:22.030 --> 02:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
and she's fearful um for her patients uh
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
lastly I'm here as a Jew um Judaism
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
teaches that life begins a birth not
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
conception it also teaches that pregnant
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
a pregnant
 
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
woman uh if they are in any way
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
negatively affected by the pregnancy
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
whether that be physical emotional
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
psychological Financial she is permitted
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
to terminate her
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy um so if this um OS
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed um it would
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
actually violate um a Jewish person's
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
right to practice their faith thank you
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
very much for listening to me thank you
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
very much ma'am um Jessica sergeant and
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.390 --> 02:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
gag hi my name is Jessica Sergeant um
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here representing myself um
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
I sit here in a incredible seat of
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
position of privilege because my husband
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
does support and prioritize me that he
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
got of a sectomy so that when we decided
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
to be childree that I didn't have to
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
bear the brunt of reproduction I got to
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
get off birth control because it was
 
02:10:37.149 --> 02:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
making me so Su so suicidal that he had
 
02:10:39.709 --> 02:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
to hide things in our home um
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
constitutionally we are able to not have
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
to participate in any sort of religion
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that also means that if people are
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
able to um with that
 
02:10:54.270 --> 02:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
laws that dictate my life should not
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
have to um have any sort of religious
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
undertones um I also believe that
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
corpses should not have more rights to
 
02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
body autonomy than a living breathing
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
human being who can tell you what they
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
do and don't want to do with their body
 
02:11:10.109 --> 02:11:10.119 align:start position:0%
I also shouldn't have to make this
 
02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
argument to men in this room who do not
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
know that my urethra is not in my vagina
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
and also to women who are being wolves
 
02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
and sheep's clothing by sitting here and
 
02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
and sheep's clothing by sitting here and
um

02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%

wolves
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
um if people can tell you what they do
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
and don't want to do then that that
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
should be your right it's it's Medical
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
Health Care at the basis of it we have
 
02:11:38.189 --> 02:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
bastardized abortion when it's just the
 
02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
medical terminology we don't bastardize
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy or any sort of therapy

Bedford New Hampshire and I'm actually
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
Dr Flynn I'm uh Internal Medicine phys
 
02:14:53.549 --> 02:14:53.559 align:start position:0%
pH currently retired taking care of my
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
family so I am here in support of the
 
02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
bill and in support of life this all
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
became personal for me during my
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
training um in my third year of
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
residency I had an infinite home and a
 
02:15:10.589 --> 02:15:10.599 align:start position:0%
husband who was a student I was the
 
02:15:13.549 --> 02:15:13.559 align:start position:0%
breadwinner and I was in the ICU
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
rotation after rotation um where I
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
didn't get a lot of sleep and I didn't
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
take care of myself very well but I
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
started to notice I had symptoms of
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
pregnancy with a less than one-year-old
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
at home I was the bread winner and I had
 
02:15:27.549 --> 02:15:27.559 align:start position:0%
a job lined
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
up so when I finished my rotations and
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
finished my training I got an ultrasound
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
and um expecting a little liab bean
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
maybe with a heartbeat and instead I was
 
02:15:41.950 --> 02:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
really shocked that there was a fully
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
formed baby sucking his thumb and his
 
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
time was about 15 weeks um
 
02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
gestation and I thought I have a job I I
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
have all this responsibility should I
 
02:15:56.669 --> 02:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
terminate the pregnancy but honestly as
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
a doctor looking at that that was a
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
sentient human being and I couldn't
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
dismember him he's now 30 years old and
 
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
he's an engineer he makes works on
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
artificial hearts and is
 
02:16:10.790 --> 02:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
married things worked out for me at that
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
time but I just had to really come to
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
grips with the personhood of my child
 
02:16:18.189 --> 02:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to just speak up for the
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
personhood of the of the children of the
 
02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
babies that are in utero because I do
 
02:16:25.629 --> 02:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
believe they are persons and as a
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
physician I want to say I believe that
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
they are their other Solutions I
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
understand there's some babies that are
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
very very sick but as a doctor and as a
 
02:16:37.629 --> 02:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
mother I don't believe in taking the
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
life of a sick person but treating them
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
treating them with compassion and with
 
02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
nurturing and with love and I feel that
 
02:16:48.509 --> 02:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
the abortion
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
mindset makes life
 
02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
expedient and denies the reality that
 
02:16:56.509 --> 02:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
suffering exists in every one of our
 
02:16:58.309 --> 02:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
lives and it would be nice to control
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
all of suffering and control all of
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
illness but we can't and I feel like we
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
need compassionate solutions to this uh
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
two sick babies in the womb that don't
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
involve in my mind taking their life um

factors a recent poll by data orbital um
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
reflects that the majority of people in

15we bill I know that many of you face
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
other factors of consideration beyond
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
the simple issue of the
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
bill today though I would like to appeal

good morning uh my name is Dr Emily zjo
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
and I ask you to oppose HB
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
476 15 weeks is an arbitrary date
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
meaning if someone received new
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
information on the first day of the 15th
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
week they could be banned from an
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
abortion as a doctor and as a patient I
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
understand just how different every
 
02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is I'm a pediatric Emergency
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
Physician a mother of two living
 
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
children and I have had two abortions it
 
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
was my first pregnancy and very much
 
02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
wanted my husband and I were shocked and
 
02:20:13.469 --> 02:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
thrilled when our first scan at 12 weeks
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
showed two
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
babies however the ultrasound also
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
showed I had a uterine anomaly a
 
02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
potentially life-threatening condition
 
02:20:23.550 --> 02:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
the Twins were in two different areas of
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
my uterus more studies suggested I was
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
safe and we would have our baby
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
girls that took a few
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
weeks we chose names I marked the date
 
02:20:38.349 --> 02:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
on my calendar when they would be 29
 
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
weeks and hopefully likely to
 
02:20:45.389 --> 02:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
survive at 16 weeks and 4 days pregnant
 
02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
I woke up in severe pain it hurt to
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
breathe I was hospitalized wi while we
 
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
learned more my husband and I sat in a
 
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
dark room where monitors showed the
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
ultrasound images turned on during happy
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
scans turned off during the sad ones
 
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
they were off for
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
ours the news was worse than we could
 
02:21:08.550 --> 02:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
imagine the left side was a previously
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
unrecognized rudimentary horn and the
 
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
uterine wall had ruptured in two places
 
02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
this fetus had no chance my womb was
 
02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
this fetus had no chance my womb was
literally

02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
literally
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
broken on the right side the baby Had A
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
congenital heart defect which would
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
require surgery and functioning lungs to
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
survive if she could make it to
 
02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
viability in my broken
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
womb these findings changed everything
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
to save my life I needed surgery and one
 
02:21:41.070 --> 02:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
of my daughters inside needed to be
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
removed after surgery the fetus on the
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
right was still
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
there but it was clear that allowing the
 
02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to continue would put me at a
 
02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
huge risk
 
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
2 weeks later at 19 weeks pregnant we
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
went to Boston for the appointment the
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
day before the DNC the
 
02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
abortion we were there for medical care
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
we were there to save my life we were
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
there because this was the most
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate decision for our family my
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
abortions saved my life allowed me to
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
have more children and allowed me to
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
continue my work to save your children's
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
lives Gran Staters and their medical
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
providers need all options available to
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
them without government
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
interference people need to make medical
 
02:22:27.389 --> 02:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
decisions with their providers and loved
 
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
ones without the state placing arbitrary
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
limitations every pregnancy is unique
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
the complexities and situations that can
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
arise are innumerable ma'am your your

abortion ban simply do not work Granite
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%

support and options
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%

02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
a resident of Campton and I been a
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
practicing pharmacist for the last 15
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
years I am here to oppose House Bill 476
 
02:23:28.349 --> 02:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is yet another attempt to
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
curil the autonomy of New Hampshire
 
02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
residents it is scientifically
 
02:23:33.950 --> 02:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and it is an attempt to solve
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
a problem that does not exist it uses
 
02:23:38.110 --> 02:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
medically incorrect language plainly in
 
02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
its title which is indicative of a
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
dedication to protecting Dogma rather
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
than protecting
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
citizens I would also like to take this
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to remind everyone in this
 
02:23:50.269 --> 02:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
room that we do not live in a theocracy
 
02:23:52.269 --> 02:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
and and if you have religious
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
convictions that those are yours and
 
02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:56.110 align:start position:0%
convictions that those are yours and
yours

02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
yours
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
alone um firstly the American College of
 
02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
OB Obstetricians and gynecologists or
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
AOG recommends the removal of the term
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
elective abortion from any policies and
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and Advocates that all
 
02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
abortions are considered medically
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
indicated the reasons patients choose to
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
terminate pregnancies are diverse and
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
complex every abortion is performed for
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic reason again that is from
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
an AOG guidance statement from this year
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
currently there's an abortion ban at 24
 
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
weeks in New Hampshire with exception
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
for the pregnant person's health or
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
fetal nonviability the currently
 
02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation seeking to ban late
 
02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
term abortion which again is not a
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
medically accurate term would restrict
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
that banned to 15 weeks according to
 
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
National Data from 2022 from the CDC
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
92.8% of abortions are performed at less
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
than or equal to 13 weeks gestations as
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
others have already stated only
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 1% of abortions
 
02:24:53.950 --> 02:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
occur after 21 weeks dropping the
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
Restriction down to 15 weeks will only
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
set a precedent that abortion rights are
 
02:24:59.269 --> 02:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
made of sandstone rather than granite
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
and can be re eroded easily over time
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
with little pre PR pressure applied I
 
02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
must again refer to the AOG statement on
 
02:25:07.469 --> 02:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
abortion rights which opposes
 
02:25:10.269 --> 02:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
gestational age banss according to AOG
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
these banss sometimes but not always
 
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
include vaguely and arbitrarily defined
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions that contribute to the
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
confusing legal landscape for patients
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
and Healthcare professionals there is no
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
just state ational age ban that
 
02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
increases the safety of abortion
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
procedures in fact gestational age bans
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
create unnecessary barriers that make it
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
more likely that patients may need to
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
seek abortion Care at later gational
 
02:25:36.510 --> 02:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
ages again that is from ACOG I am tired
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
of having to fight for my right for
 
02:25:40.349 --> 02:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and the autonomy of my
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
children and my family members and
 
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
friends every legislative cycle how many
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
male members of the House of
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives are kept up at Night by
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
the concern that their young Sons will
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
have fewer rights to their own body than
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
they did why is our state motto Live
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
Free or Die it feels like a gimmick
 
02:26:00.429 --> 02:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
rather than a solemn commitment to the
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
right to live without government
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
overreach into deeply private and
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
personal decisions if this law is an
 
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
argument for the protection of children
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
then I would like to remind you that the
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
number one killer of children in this
 
02:26:13.469 --> 02:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
country is gun violence in the current
 
02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
Administration your three minutes is up
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
I'd ask you to please finish up sure um
 
02:26:20.590 --> 02:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
I would encourage everyone here says
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
they are four children to call the White
 
02:26:24.750 --> 02:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
House every single day to reinstate that
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
office of gun violent prevention I would
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
also like to is there another is there
 
02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
another hearing for the amendment you're
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
at yes there will be heing amend I'll be
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
back have do you have written testimony
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
I'll have to email it okay that's
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
fine uh Jake Barry and on Deck will be
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.230 --> 02:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
so Jake Barry is Jake Barry
 
02:27:08.429 --> 02:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
here oh all right so uh Jake Barry's not
 
02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
here then attorney Ian yout and on Deck
 
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
Courtney oh Courtney heed oh Courtney
 
02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
Reed yeah Courtney Reed
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
yes Mr uitt Mr chairman and members of
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
the committee Ian huitt Council for
 
02:27:29.309 --> 02:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone in support of House Bill
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
476 two points for the committee one on
 
02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
the rationale behind 15 weak banss and
 
02:27:38.429 --> 02:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
two on how a 15we line could affect a
 
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
long-term settlement of this issue in
 
02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the dobs against
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
Jackson case chief justice Roberts wrote
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
a separate concurrence where he said the
 
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
court should uphold a row case framework
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
while also upholding a 15we ban and his
 
02:27:56.670 --> 02:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
argument was that the core right in
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
Rowan Casey was always about Choice
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
which 15 weeks provides the court has
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
always said that at a certain point a
 
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
woman who fails to act consents to the
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
state's intervention on behalf of the
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
child and he wrote quote 15 weeks is
 
02:28:15.389 --> 02:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
well beyond the point at which nearly
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
all women are aware that they are
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant most Granite Staters share that
 
02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
same intuition that's why people's
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
opinions in this state on abortion drop
 
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
off sharply around 15 weeks about 70% of
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
the state supports unlimited elective
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
abortion before 15 weeks after 15 weeks
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
if you do polling asking about specific
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
policies and not just abortion
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
generically up or down 60 to 64% of the
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
state agree with Banning elective
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
abortion after 15 with only 32 to 34%
 
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
disagreeing most regular Granite Staters
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
see 15 weeks as an adequate window to
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
make a choice secondly a lot of the
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
polarizing rhetoric around the 24-week
 
02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
ban was a result of cynical
 
02:29:04.910 --> 02:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
misinformation such as many people
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
describing it in the media as an
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
abortion ban with no exceptions for rape
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
period that would not be the case under
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
under this bill because even the
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
opponents of the bill need to
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
differentiate it from the existing law
 
02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
in order to mobilize their supporters
 
02:29:21.790 --> 02:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
against it and in fact we can already
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
see people referring to it as the 15we
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
ban two things would happen if this bill
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
moved forward through the Democratic
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
process one is that the Bill's opponents
 
02:29:34.110 --> 02:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
would actually diffuse the energy on
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
their own side because they would be
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
highlighting the moderate nature of this
 
02:29:42.429 --> 02:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
bill and their own unpopular extremism
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
and secondly through this process people
 
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
on the opposite poll would come to see
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
that the idea of going even further than
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
this bill bill is not viable in this
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
state under this political system so
 
02:29:57.429 --> 02:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
this bill could affect a long-term
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
settlement between Granite Staters of
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
deeply held and divided views in a way
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
that most people of the state if not
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
most of the political class agrees with
 
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
if the committee is doing any questions
 
02:30:12.429 --> 02:30:12.439 align:start position:0%
today I'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
for this wedness I have one yes
 
02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.830 align:start position:0%
for this wedness I have one yes
representative

02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
far so I I know that today uh we have
 
02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
heard from quite a lot of uh folks
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
testifying including some medical
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners testifying that there are
 
02:30:31.469 --> 02:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
very significant defects that cannot be
 
02:30:34.590 --> 02:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh practicably determined before the 15
 
02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
to 24- we window uh and that some of
 
02:30:39.150 --> 02:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
those defects including some of the
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
heart defects that were described are
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
such as to uh have a an extremely
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
negative impact uh on the child's uh
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
future life does Cornerstone have a
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
point of view not on whether or not
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
knowing about those defects uh ought to
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
change a
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
decision uh on that child uh and whether
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
or not to abort that child but do you
 
02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
have a point of view on whether or not
 
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
it is in fact impracticable to
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
satisfactorily diagnose those defects
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
prior to 15
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
weeks we do we did not take a position
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
though on the addition of the broad
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
fetal anomalies incompatible with life
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
exception that's included in our current
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
law and that exception is reiterated in
 
02:31:26.269 --> 02:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
this law I'd also point out that we have
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
a very broad Health exception in the
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
state almost all the cases you've heard
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
about today from Deep Red States like
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
Texas are in states where there is
 
02:31:36.429 --> 02:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
effectively only a life exception New
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a very broad exception for
 
02:31:40.429 --> 02:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
any serious risk to the mother's
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
physical health uh which is the same
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
exception the court required under R
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
casy existed in States like
 
02:31:47.389 --> 02:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for many years until
 
02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
around 2020 and that same broad help
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
exception is reiterated in this law so
 
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
the kinds of situations we see in Texas
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
would not arise here in New Hampshire
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this wit
 
02:32:00.269 --> 02:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed and on Deck will be uh
 
02:32:14.269 --> 02:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
mcginness thank you chair Lyn and
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
record my name is Courtney Reid I as
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
policy Advocate with the ACLU of New
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm speaking in opposition
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh as we've observed today
 
02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh and in numerous polls we know that
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters overwhelmingly support
 
02:32:36.750 --> 02:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
the notion that everyone has the freedom
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
to make their own decisions about their
 
02:32:41.230 --> 02:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
bodies and their Futures and that that
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
this includes the decision to have an
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
abortion and I want to express thanks to
 
02:32:48.910 --> 02:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill and the
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee for their perception uh to
 
02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
this opposition to the underlying
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill because HB
 
02:32:59.830 --> 02:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
476 if enacted would undermine our
 
02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
country's and our state's long-standing
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
values to protect personal autonomy by
 
02:33:07.469 --> 02:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
stripping away this fundamental right in
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
real world situations with cruel
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
consequences we've heard many stories
 
02:33:15.550 --> 02:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
today about the devastating effects of
 
02:33:18.190 --> 02:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
abortion bans even with exceptions like
 
02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:20.190 align:start position:0%
abortion bans even with exceptions like
476

02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
476
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I would just outline a few uh since
 
02:33:27.070 --> 02:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
2022 over 100 pregnant women in distress
 
02:33:29.349 --> 02:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
across the country were mistreated or
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
were turned away from emergency rooms
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
because of bans in Florida a 15-week
 
02:33:37.309 --> 02:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman miscarried after being
 
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
negligently discharged despite having a
 
02:33:42.429 --> 02:33:42.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous ultrasound she later needed
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
emergency care and was placed on a
 
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
ventilator and spent 6 days
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
recovering in Georgia Amber
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
28 years old died after being denied an
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
abortion despite the state's medical
 
02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:57.110 align:start position:0%
abortion despite the state's medical
emergency

02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:33:59.150 --> 02:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions the state's maternal
 
02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
mortality review deemed her death was
 
02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:05.479 align:start position:0%
preventable we know that the inability
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
to access abortion laws not only leaves
 
02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh women suffering from these horrible
 
02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
Health consequences but that they're
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
more likely to experience poverty
 
02:34:17.469 --> 02:34:17.479 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to stay with abusive
 
02:34:19.710 --> 02:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
partners and that these bands have shown
 
02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
known to be correlated with poor
 
02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
maternal Health outcomes across the
 
02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
board and we've heard and we know that
 
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
doctors are bound to Medical ethics but
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
that HB 476 does not accommodate for all
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
of the variances in individual
 
02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and it would make it
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for doctors to act in the best
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
interests of their
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
patients and that's because this bill
 
02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
hovers severe criminal liabilities over
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
doctors when they're exercis ing
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
discretion um it puts them in an
 
02:34:56.030 --> 02:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
impossible situation where they would
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
exercise an abundance of caution and act
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
against their best medical judgment to
 
02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:01.790 align:start position:0%
against their best medical judgment to
avoid

02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
criminalization this will not only
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
endanger patients but it will deter
 
02:35:07.950 --> 02:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
future clinicians from practicing in the
 
02:35:10.670 --> 02:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
state in fact in 2021 when New
 
02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current abortion ban was
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
introduced we heard from providers that
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties would
 
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
disincentivize them to work in three
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
minutes is up I'd ask you to please wrap
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you uh just on a final note we
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%
know that the choice to have an abortion
 
02:35:27.429 --> 02:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
is a private important decision that
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
should be free from critical
 
02:35:32.429 --> 02:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
interference and uh our residents
 
02:35:34.830 --> 02:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
deserve access to care when they need it
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
so again we urge legislators to vote in
 
02:35:39.389 --> 02:35:39.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to this Bill thank you thank
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
you do you have a written question thank
 
02:35:44.309 --> 02:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
you so much yes if you could bring that
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh so Jean mcginness and on De will
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
be shot
 
02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:52.469 align:start position:0%
be shot
sh

02:35:52.469 --> 02:35:52.479 align:start position:0%

02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether we will EXA either this bill or

02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm I I as far as whether we would
 
02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:41.560 align:start position:0%

please thank you chairman I hope none of
 
02:36:57.150 --> 02:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
you leave my name is Gan mcginness and I
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
02:37:01.950 --> 02:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm here as a citizen as a
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
grandmother um and as actually a citizen
 
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who is female and I
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of people talking about
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire but it's
 
02:37:14.550 --> 02:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
really the women of New Hampshire who
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be affected by this bill
 
02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand how a group of of
 
02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
politicians who have been elected in a
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
state that really believes in Live Free
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
or Die would decide that half of the
 
02:37:33.230 --> 02:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
population should have a a decision made
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
that is not theirs uh a medical decision
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
for me has been about choice and I
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
respected that law that said I could
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
choose whether I wanted to have an
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
abortion or not and yes I was a person
 
02:37:50.550 --> 02:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
who was pregnant before I thought I
 
02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
should be but I got to choose and his
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
name's Joshua and he's 40 and he just
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
had twins so I have Evelyn and Ronan now
 
02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
as well and all of these decisions to me
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
just seem so strange that you do not
 
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
trust women enough to make their own
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
decision these are very difficult
 
02:38:14.269 --> 02:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
complex decisions for women to make they
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
should not be legislated by law they are
 
02:38:19.870 --> 02:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
a moral decision they are a decision
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
about belief they are decision about
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
economy they are decision about your
 
02:38:28.150 --> 02:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
life and your your future life and the
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
medicine that you're using when this law
 
02:38:34.349 --> 02:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
passed 50 years ago when I was quite
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
young that it was to save women's lives
 
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
and as many of the medical professionals
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
have told you you'll be essentially
 
02:38:46.910 --> 02:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
letting women die again or find ways for
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
them to get rid of fetuses that they
 
02:38:52.269 --> 02:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't want because it's a power struggle
 
02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
when someone is taken by another human
 
02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
and usually it's a man who takes that
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
person and violates them so to let this
 
02:39:08.269 --> 02:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
law even come into a discussion is
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
shocking to me and I realize it's only
 
02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
about a hundred years ago that I as a
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
woman got a right to vote I believe it
 
02:39:18.750 --> 02:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
was 1920 so it's not that long and not
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
only that I didn't have a right to
 
02:39:23.150 --> 02:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
property prior to that as well so I
 
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would not go back in
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
time and go back to a time when I was
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
very young I was able to grow up during
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
a time that I had the right to make that
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
decision and that decision I made was a
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
choice because I had the power to do it
 
02:39:44.269 --> 02:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
and it was my faith and my belief and my
 
02:39:48.349 --> 02:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
ability as a human as a woman to say yes
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
I can make this choice
 
02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
his name is Joshua and I would like
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
every other woman in this state to have
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
that right to make that choice thank you

care that so many need I ask you to
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%

most intimate decisions of her life
 
02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
not only that but this is deeply
 
02:41:25.469 --> 02:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
unpopular poll after poll shows that
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%

02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:50.240 align:start position:0%

the Second Step a nonprofit domestic
 
02:42:30.439 --> 02:42:31.389 align:start position:0%
the Second Step a nonprofit domestic
violence

02:42:31.389 --> 02:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
organization many people who have
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
testified today have discussed the OB
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
deserts and the ramification of banss to
 
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
accessing Healthcare I want to speak
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
about the intersection of domestic
 
02:42:43.630 --> 02:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
violence and abortion
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
access we know that any changes to the
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
power and control Dynamic associated
 
02:42:50.349 --> 02:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
with intimate partner violence
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
significantly increases the risk of
 
02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
lethality pregnancy is an increasingly
 
02:42:59.630 --> 02:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
significant change to this
 
02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
Dynamic domestic violence including
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
abuse that involves reproductive
 
02:43:06.910 --> 02:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
coercion frequently results in
 
02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
non-consensual pregnancies restrictive
 
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
abortion access exacerbates domestic
 
02:43:14.110 --> 02:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
violence resulting in increased
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
isolation vulnerability health risks and
 
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
delays in seeking help by passing this
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill and entertaining similarly
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
restrictive bills there will undoubtedly
 
02:43:26.429 --> 02:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
be an increase in domestic violence and
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
thus creating a situation in which
 
02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
survivors cannot feel safe coming
 
02:43:35.230 --> 02:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
forward to seek help I oppose HB 476 and
 
02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
if you support domestic violent
 
02:43:38.910 --> 02:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
survivors I implore you to oppose this

horror and disgust at the injustices of
 
02:44:54.349 --> 02:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
slavery where the lives and rights of
 
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
millions of men and women were violated
 
02:44:58.910 --> 02:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
those violations occurred because the
 
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:00.920 align:start position:0%

02:45:07.469 --> 02:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
were the politicians who looked the
 
02:45:10.510 --> 02:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
other way for political gain those men
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%

shameful memory a with a real chance to
 
02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
take ground against slavery is proposed
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
and the Very ones who elect to push it
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%

that we are any better than our
 
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
ancestors or that we have progressed we
 
02:45:45.309 --> 02:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
are fighting the same battle we were
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
fighting 200 years ago but with
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
different victims and 10 times the
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
number of victims you're being lied to
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
choose death do not seek the approval of
 
02:45:58.110 --> 02:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
those who would tell you to sacrifice
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
the lives of The Unborn they're making
 
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
promises to you um that you will gain
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
from compromising the truth but um my

friends they are lying to you someday
 
02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
our nation will look back on abortion
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
with the with the same abhorrence and
 
02:46:14.429 --> 02:46:14.439 align:start position:0%
shame that we see slavery now the
 
02:46:16.349 --> 02:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
dehumanizing slaughter of the innocent
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
that our nation engages in will be seen
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
for what it is barbaric idolatrous child
 
02:46:24.510 --> 02:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
sacrifice today you have the choice to
 
02:46:26.269 --> 02:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
be counted among those who played along
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
with this Abomination for political gain
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
or to use your influence to do what is
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
right to do what you were elected to do

stand before God and it will be no
 
02:46:43.750 --> 02:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
Comfort to your generational reputation
 
02:46:45.309 --> 02:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
when the wicked murder of children is
 
02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000 align:start position:0%

submitted it online coup sheets that's
 
02:47:17.630 --> 02:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
fine thank you hi good afternoon my name
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
is Sue Allen I live in
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hollis I many years ago had a
 
02:47:28.030 --> 02:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
spontaneous abortion uh this is the kind
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
where with only a couple hours of uh
 
02:47:35.469 --> 02:47:35.479 align:start position:0%
warning I was holding a perfectly
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
formed baby in my hand I was 16 weeks
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant and the doctor told me that the
 
02:47:48.349 --> 02:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
baby measured at 12 and a half weeks now
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
my testimony is I want to emphasize is
 
02:47:56.590 --> 02:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
that I've seen and held the baby which
 
02:47:59.230 --> 02:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh further research told me that um
 
02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
around 12 weeks is when the babies are
 
02:48:06.150 --> 02:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly formed um they they they don't
 
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
look like a space alien um and I I can
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
tell you with my own eyes it took me
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
years to get over the shock of it I'd
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
speak of it at inappropriate times
 
02:48:20.910 --> 02:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
um in any case uh the point I want to
 
02:48:25.389 --> 02:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
make here um is according to the numbers
 
02:48:28.630 --> 02:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
that this proposal for a 15we ban which
 
02:48:32.269 --> 02:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
I support is that uh as been already
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
testified there's um uh 95 plus I forget
 
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
the numbers uh um abortions are already
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh between the 8 and 12 week Point um
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
also to try to explain to you why
 
02:48:49.230 --> 02:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's this sentiment
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
of 60
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
plus% I forget what was testified of
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
General support that will after uh after
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
15 weeks the majority of us in New
 
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire don't don't support this well
 
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
I want to say that it's a sense of the
 
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
humanity of the the baby at that point
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
of development that I can tell you that
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
I saw with my own eyes so what I
 
02:49:16.110 --> 02:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you to recognize here is that
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
what's at stake is life and death
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
decisions over a
 
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
developed baby um there's an issue among
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
um many women who are like me Mothers uh
 
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
and and me myself at my younger stage
 
02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
where we have to choose our health
 
02:49:43.309 --> 02:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
providers carefully because of the
 
02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
bizarre situation of being told this
 
02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
gets reported among women that well I I
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
was told that the baby was going to be
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
have such and such defect
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
and it their their their proposed
 
02:50:01.950 --> 02:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
abortion when well no we're we're going
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
to see how this turns out and then it
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
turns out that there aren't defects
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't Down syndrome or
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
whatever there there's a certain
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
mistrust of is there this zero
 
02:50:18.190 --> 02:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
population growth agenda maam you're
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%

attorney and I practice fertility law so
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%

02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
to get pregnant or who are pregnant I'm
 
02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600 align:start position:0%

people who are trying to build their
 
02:51:12.830 --> 02:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
families so I work with people who want
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
to be pregnant who desperately want to
 
02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
have a baby this bill is bad for them
 
02:51:20.190 --> 02:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
there are complications that can happen
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
during the pregnancy that are going to
 
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
hurt these women and hurt and and just
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
cause tremendous pain you've heard about
 
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
that from the doctors the things that
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
happen after 15 weeks impact very much
 
02:51:36.870 --> 02:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
wanted pregnancies and we want our
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
doctors to be able to treat those women
 
02:51:41.309 --> 02:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
and to provide them with Compassionate
 
02:51:43.870 --> 02:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
Care at a very difficult time of very
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
much wanted pregnancy and I'll I'll I'll
 
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
just address that question about the the
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
fetal Anatomy coming from a lawyer's P
 
02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
perspective we work with surrogates and
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
when we have a surrogate we will have
 
02:51:57.309 --> 02:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that surrogate is having an
 
02:51:59.469 --> 02:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
anatomy scan around 20 weeks of
 
02:52:02.389 --> 02:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we would love to do it earlier
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
if we could do that at 10 weeks or 12
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
weeks we absolutely would do that
 
02:52:08.229 --> 02:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
everybody wants answers to know how that
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
fetus is forming but we can't do it
 
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
until later on because the the vital
 
02:52:16.190 --> 02:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
organs are not formed until later on so
 
02:52:18.229 --> 02:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
20 weeks is where we can start really
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
looking look at the heart the kidneys
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
all of those things that that we need to
 
02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
look at and these are very much wanted
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancies this bill would be very bad
 
02:52:29.790 --> 02:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
for these pregnancies and it's just not
 
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire thank you very
 
02:52:35.630 --> 02:52:35.640 align:start position:0%

02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
my name is David laru I'm the father of
 
02:52:52.750 --> 02:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
two sons under three years old uh a
 
02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
little under seven weeks ago I just
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
caught my second son in my own hands in
 
02:52:59.389 --> 02:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
my own home with my wife and I and I can
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
tell you coming through the birth canal
 
02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
does not change whether that is a life
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
or not okay I don't know whether I
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
actually support this bill or not
 
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
because I really do not hear
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about the true issues here
 
02:53:13.870 --> 02:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
okay we are not speaking about the due
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
process of law that is supposed to be
 
02:53:18.870 --> 02:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
afforded to life if you Google life AI
 
02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
Google says life is defined by a set of
 
02:53:23.030 --> 02:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
characteristics that distinguish living
 
02:53:24.590 --> 02:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
organizations from non-living matter

02:53:37.469 --> 02:53:37.479 align:start position:0%
undergoing Evolution I would challenge
 
02:53:39.590 --> 02:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
you to run that definition through the
 
02:53:41.349 --> 02:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
idea if you were in a car accident and
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
you are now on life support or in a coma
 
02:53:45.389 --> 02:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
or you are born with Down Syndrome or
 
02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
you have some other anomaly or some
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
action that happens to you in life are
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
you no now are you no longer now
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
subjected to the protections of Life do
 
02:53:56.349 --> 02:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
we have a right to life we have a right
 
02:53:59.309 --> 02:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
to not be deprived of our life until we
 
02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
have had due process whether that is
 
02:54:04.030 --> 02:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
while we are alive or post humously in
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
the case of a wrongful homicide explain
 
02:54:10.590 --> 02:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
to me how we can give due process of law
 
02:54:13.150 --> 02:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
to that clearly defin Defined
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
Life when it is still in the womb as I
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
understand it New Hampshire still on the
 
02:54:20.309 --> 02:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
books has a fetal homicide law that in
 
02:54:23.229 --> 02:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
March of this last year somebody was was
 
02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
indicted for a double homicide for
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
killing a woman and 37 week old baby as
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
I read that law as I understand it's
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
still in the books that is a 20 we
 
02:54:36.150 --> 02:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
standard that the state says after 20
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
weeks this is considered personhood for
 
02:54:41.710 --> 02:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
the purposes of Criminal
 
02:54:45.309 --> 02:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
Intent at between 20 and 24 weeks I
 
02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
cannot kill the baby without fear of
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
homicide but a mother or a For Hire
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
practitioner can legally medicine is not
 
02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
a right in this country I'm old enough
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
to remember Co where it was demanded you
 
02:55:00.110 --> 02:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
follow the government instructed um
 
02:55:03.309 --> 02:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
rights and most medical organized people
 
02:55:05.229 --> 02:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
were demanding you bow down to
 
02:55:09.870 --> 02:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
government pressure okay a baby has its
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
own independent DNA from
 
02:55:16.590 --> 02:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
conception if you had your DNA or there
 
02:55:19.349 --> 02:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
was another set of DNA at a crime you
 
02:55:21.870 --> 02:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
would demand that that was not your
 
02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to pay for that because it is
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
not your DNA okay the right to not be
 
02:55:31.469 --> 02:55:31.479 align:start position:0%
deprived of your life this is what is
 
02:55:34.030 --> 02:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
essential it is not a feel-good measure
 
02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
it is not a right to medicine if that
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
was logically true and legally true we
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
must bring in all manner of surgeries
 
02:55:44.750 --> 02:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
and expensive cares into the domain of
 
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
your rights that you must be forced to
 
02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:48.990 align:start position:0%
your rights that you must be forced to
take

02:55:48.990 --> 02:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
the fruit of somebody else's labor and
 
02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:52.269 align:start position:0%
the fruit of somebody else's labor and
their

02:55:52.269 --> 02:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
occupation because it is your right I'm
 
02:55:56.309 --> 02:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
sorry sir you know you've reached your
 
02:55:58.349 --> 02:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
three minute Mark so I'd ask you to
 
02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
please finish up to sum it up medicine
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
in this country is almost $5
 
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
billion it is over 17% of our gross
 
02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:11.269 align:start position:0%
billion it is over 17% of our gross
domestic

02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
product the right to life is a gross
 
02:56:15.870 --> 02:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of what we actually
 
02:56:19.229 --> 02:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
have under the law but clearly this is
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
life and that is the issue that needs to
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
be decided within the courts before you
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
place arbitrary deadlines on these
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
things thank you thank you very much all
 
02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
right Ryan McKennon and on Deck will be
 
02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:34.710 align:start position:0%
right Ryan McKennon and on Deck will be
Brian

02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
Brian
 
02:56:39.070 --> 02:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh Richards Richardson yes all
 
02:56:41.870 --> 02:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
right hi my name is Ryan McKenna I'm an
 
02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
attorney and a native to this state um
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
this I I am here to urge support for
 
02:56:51.950 --> 02:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 476 in uh opposition to the
 
02:56:54.429 --> 02:56:54.439 align:start position:0%
amendment uh this is clearly a touchy
 
02:56:56.429 --> 02:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
subject while I was here my wife texted
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
me that there was a 3.9 magnitude
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
earthquake which uh I'm sure happened by
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
chance but regardless this is a touchy
 
02:57:05.309 --> 02:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
subject and I come here to make two
 
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
points and a practical
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
observation um my first point is that I
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
think this issue is right for debate and
 
02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
um and the and the subject is when when
 
02:57:18.510 --> 02:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
is the deadline up to which you can have
 
02:57:20.190 --> 02:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
an abortion right I think that issue is
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
right for debate based on the Overton
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
window I think the second uh point I
 
02:57:27.309 --> 02:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to make is is really to ask the
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
question whose job is it to have this
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
debate and in the opinion of this
 
02:57:33.990 --> 02:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
speaker it's it's your job and I'd urge
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
you to have that debate and then my
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
practical observation is just as a
 
02:57:41.870 --> 02:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
father who uh recently lost a baby at 10
 
02:57:44.590 --> 02:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
weeks through miscarriage um and have
 
02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
seven children I'm somewhat familiar
 
02:57:49.630 --> 02:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
with the with the physical aspects of it
 
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
as well as um the effect on the on the
 
02:57:55.510 --> 02:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
men right on the father um but what what
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
it made me realize is there's a custom n
 
02:58:00.429 --> 02:58:00.439 align:start position:0%
really around the world when do you
 
02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
announce that you're pregnant how many
 
02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
weeks should you be before you make that
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
announcement and there's clearly a
 
02:58:09.469 --> 02:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
higher risk of miscarriage before you
 
02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
know 10 weeks uh and I think the custom
 
02:58:14.510 --> 02:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
was always 12 weeks you wait waited 12
 
02:58:16.830 --> 02:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
weeks to make the pregnancy public to
 
02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
your friends and family so I think that
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to come here and make that
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
practical observation as to there's a
 
02:58:25.309 --> 02:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
time when this sort of um Private Matter
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
becomes public and the custom is 12
 
02:58:29.590 --> 02:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
weeks we we chose to announce a little
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
bit premature I'd say 10 weeks and that
 
02:58:34.469 --> 02:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
happened so here the medical providers
 
02:58:36.030 --> 02:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
in the room provided many examples of
 
02:58:38.110 --> 02:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
exceptions that imply in my opinion
 
02:58:40.229 --> 02:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
logical asent to the general rule that
 
02:58:42.750 --> 02:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
an adequate medical reason or other
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
reason is needed and often exists for
 
02:58:47.710 --> 02:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
terminating a pregnancy I've not heard
 
02:58:49.469 --> 02:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
of medical provider make the case for
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
opposition using example of a healthy
 
02:58:54.070 --> 02:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
mother and a healthy 16we child in utero
 
02:58:55.469 --> 02:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
I think you have a responsibility to
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
balance the state's obligation to
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
preserve Life In Utero with the mother's
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
interests for for health and safety and
 
02:59:03.950 --> 02:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
this is the debate in in my opinion it's
 
02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
your job to have that issue is whether
 
02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
15 weeks is the appropriate Mark um
 
02:59:12.750 --> 02:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone action published a survey
 
02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
that showed that 60 to 65% of New
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constituents support an
 
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
abortion ban after 15 weeks with
 
02:59:21.670 --> 02:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions that should be debated and
 
02:59:23.830 --> 02:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
that um this bill enables debate on a on
 
02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
a topic that's been suppressed for for
 
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
over 50 years and biased I think over
 
02:59:30.750 --> 02:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
that time C culturally um I have nothing
 
02:59:32.269 --> 02:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
further to add other than that I call
 
02:59:34.110 --> 02:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
upon you especially New Hampshire
 
02:59:37.389 --> 02:59:37.399 align:start position:0%

02:59:41.389 --> 02:59:41.399 align:start position:0%

Bill 476 the legislation seeking to
 
03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
restrict reproductive care in New
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the New Hampshire Medical
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
Society strongly opposes governmental
 
03:03:27.950 --> 03:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
inter interference in the doctor patient
 
03:03:29.870 --> 03:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
relationship and laws that restrict a
 
03:03:32.670 --> 03:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
patient's right to access evidence-based
 
03:03:35.229 --> 03:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
Health Care as you've heard from the
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
many Physicians clinicians and parents
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
providing testimony today elective
 
03:03:44.229 --> 03:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
abortions are medical care care that
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
takes into consideration the physical
 
03:03:48.510 --> 03:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
and mental health of the patient
 
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
as well as other complex
 
03:03:53.190 --> 03:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances the Physicians on my board
 
03:03:55.950 --> 03:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
of directors on the council that governs
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
the advocacy of the medical society and
 
03:04:00.269 --> 03:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
the members of my Association have
 
03:04:02.309 --> 03:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
countless years of experience practicing
 
03:04:04.190 --> 03:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
medicine and taking care of New
 
03:04:07.349 --> 03:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's citizens and families these
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
doctors took an oath to First Do no harm
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
and as you know unplanned pregnancy
 
03:04:15.870 --> 03:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
happens sometimes in spite of the use of
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate contraception and proper
 
03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:21.080 align:start position:0%
precautions some of their patients have
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
been raped trafficked and vict and are
 
03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
victims of incest some patients will
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
have no medical complications of
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy until much later in their term
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
under this law there is no pres
 
03:04:36.030 --> 03:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
provision for a 13-year-old child who
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
would be required to deliver a baby
 
03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
resulting in unimaginable trauma and
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
additional loss of bodily autonomy and
 
03:04:47.030 --> 03:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
victimization there's no Pro provision
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
for the victim of rape or the mother of
 
03:04:52.110 --> 03:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
two who faces considerable medical risk
 
03:04:54.190 --> 03:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
in carrying an additional
 
03:04:56.830 --> 03:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
child this law would deny patients the
 
03:04:58.830 --> 03:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy they deserve and the
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to proceed with medical care
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
that is safe and performed within a
 
03:05:05.110 --> 03:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
trusted medical
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
relationship the medical society opposes
 
03:05:09.550 --> 03:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislation that penalizes and
 
03:05:12.670 --> 03:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
criminalizes evidence-based practices it
 
03:05:14.590 --> 03:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
is imperative that New Hampshire laws
 
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
continue to support clinical
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
relationships between a physician and
 
03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
their patient and the full spectrum of
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
Health Care within a well-informed
 
03:05:25.870 --> 03:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
clinical setting I would like to leave
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
you with a few thought-provoking points
 
03:05:31.469 --> 03:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
medical decisions as we've heard today
 
03:05:34.429 --> 03:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
are personal like all medical matters
 
03:05:36.269 --> 03:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding abortion should be
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
made only by patients in consultation
 
03:05:41.229 --> 03:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
with their physician and Health Care
 
03:05:43.710 --> 03:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
Professionals regulating scientifically
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
and evidence-based Medical Care is a
 
03:05:48.630 --> 03:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
slippery slope to all of us
 
03:05:50.630 --> 03:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
the decision to treat heart dis me ma'am
 
03:05:52.190 --> 03:05:52.200 align:start position:0%

just please sum sum it up okay in
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
conclusion the medical society believes
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
that well-informed evidence-based
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
practices should not be tampered with
 
03:06:05.309 --> 03:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
should not tamper with a physician and
 
03:06:07.710 --> 03:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
clinician and their patients that they
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
serve the medical society opposes the
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
criminalization of any medically
 
03:06:14.190 --> 03:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
necessary treatment thank you very much

03:06:50.110 --> 03:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:06:52.830 --> 03:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
476 I believe this bill is harmful to
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
patients providers the entire Healthcare
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
System and our economy but more
 
03:07:00.510 --> 03:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
importantly I think it's politically
 
03:07:02.670 --> 03:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
impracticable let's just say that we
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
decide to ignore the governor's
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
statements or our own caucuses our the
 
03:07:10.830 --> 03:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors in this case and maybe your own
 
03:07:10.840 --> 03:07:11.950 align:start position:0%
sponsors in this case and maybe your own
campaign

03:07:11.950 --> 03:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
03:07:14.229 --> 03:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
assurances let's say you ignore the
 
03:07:16.990 --> 03:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
science the polling the economics the
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
testimon of experts and the really
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
passionate thoughtful testimony from
 
03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
everyday Granite Staters and even some
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
religious leaders let's say you ignore
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that a cruel 15we abortion ban
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
with vague language will effectively be
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
signing death warrants for people like
 
03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
your family members who might experience
 
03:07:42.190 --> 03:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
complications in pregnancy and run out
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
of time or could not afford to travel to
 
03:07:47.510 --> 03:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
other states for healthcare access let's
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
just say you ignore all the science the
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
facts the logic the reason the humanity
 
03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
and you go ahead and you pass this bill
 
03:07:57.790 --> 03:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
let's be clear passage of HB
 
03:08:00.830 --> 03:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
476 will accelerate the quickening pace
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
of voting age electorate members in New
 
03:08:06.150 --> 03:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that run not walk away from
 
03:08:08.590 --> 03:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
the party that passes the law and
 
03:08:10.830 --> 03:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
towards candidates who will protect
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
independent medical decision-making and
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
the right to reproductive healthc care
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
Choice let this be a warning a 15we
 
03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
abortion ban will trigger a gener a
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
generational wave against entrusting
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
those who pass it to craft public policy
 
03:08:28.630 --> 03:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
the party responsible will be unlikely
 
03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
to fully recover passage of HB 476 will
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
be a strategic failure and a colossal
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
mistake I'm here finally on behalf of my
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
provider constituents and the maternally
 
03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
reproductive age individuals of my
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
district and myself to express my deep
 
03:08:46.990 --> 03:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
disappointment that we even need to
 
03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:47.950 align:start position:0%
disappointment that we even need to
expend

03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
expend
 
03:08:50.510 --> 03:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
this much Collective energy and these
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
resources to entertain a bill that
 
03:08:54.429 --> 03:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
further restricts reproductive health
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
care for women without acknowledging and
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
without naming the true discrimination
 
03:09:00.510 --> 03:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
that pregnant individuals in New
 
03:09:02.229 --> 03:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are facing due to ongoing
 
03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
political attacks the mere fact that
 
03:09:06.910 --> 03:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
we're not discussing the efficacy or
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
wisdom of restricting male reproductive
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
Health Care procedures when a man is 50%
 
03:09:15.229 --> 03:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
of all causes for pregnancies
 
03:09:17.070 --> 03:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the true discrimination
 
03:09:19.550 --> 03:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
against and Injustice thrust upon women
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
and pregnant people here in New
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is the point that really
 
03:09:26.830 --> 03:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
gets me upset a tax on access to women's
 
03:09:29.309 --> 03:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
health care but not to Men's Health Care
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
is blatant discrimination based on sex
 
03:09:33.710 --> 03:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
and it's a substantial government
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
interference into privacy and medical
 
03:09:39.030 --> 03:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
privacy but even though I'm angry about
 
03:09:41.469 --> 03:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
these attacks and for my constituents
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
providers patients and myself I'm
 
03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated to defeating bills like this
 
03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
HB 476
 
03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure access to safe and effective
 
03:09:53.469 --> 03:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthare procedures your
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
time and for these reasons I urge
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan defeat of HB 476 please vote
 
03:10:01.309 --> 03:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
no if you have the opportunity today um
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%

03:10:06.510 --> 03:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
see fit thank you thank you very much um

turned the yeah that's it thank you I'm
 
03:11:26.190 --> 03:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
actually very disappointed that we're
 
03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
still here talking about this this is
 
03:11:31.469 --> 03:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
something that has it should have ended
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
52 years ago with roie Wade and the fact
 
03:11:37.870 --> 03:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
that I am here I'm a student I should be
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
studying right now not here defending my
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
rights and trying to make sure that the
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
little girls that I took took care of I
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
was a nanny for
 
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
years and I have to look at them and
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
watch them grow with less rights than I
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
did when I was born to do this to put
 
03:12:04.229 --> 03:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
this bill through robs them of the
 
03:12:06.990 --> 03:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
rights that I should have that they
 
03:12:09.469 --> 03:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
should have to their own bodies to their
 
03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
own bodily autonomies to say yes to
 
03:12:17.950 --> 03:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
continue to push women back down
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
it puts us back into a time where I I
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't even remember cuz I wasn't born
 
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
yet this is 52 years that you will be
 
03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
sending us back
 
03:12:32.469 --> 03:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
to 15 minutes I mean 15 weeks is not
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
enough time to be able to make a
 
03:12:37.469 --> 03:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
decision like this this is a
 
03:12:37.479 --> 03:12:39.790 align:start position:0%
decision like this this is a
life-changing

03:12:39.790 --> 03:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
life-changing
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
decision and it affects so many pregnant
 
03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
women I've had reconsider whether or not
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have children because of
 
03:12:55.389 --> 03:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
bills like this because I don't know if
 
03:12:58.229 --> 03:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
I can trust that you have our best
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
decisions in mind when I see these
 
03:13:05.349 --> 03:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
things especially at the very beginning
 
03:13:08.790 --> 03:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the year this is January and we're
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
already discussing a ban on abortions
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
again this is the beginning of the year
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
and this is where we're taking our first
 
03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
steps we're not
 
03:13:21.910 --> 03:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the actual problems that
 
03:13:24.910 --> 03:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
are going on in this state right now
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
there is a major housing issue where I
 
03:13:32.590 --> 03:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
probably won't be able to afford a home
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
until I'm well into my 40s and even then
 
03:13:39.870 --> 03:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
I probably still won't be able to afford
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
one I'm so disappointed that I am here
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
today that I had to drive over over an
 
03:13:51.150 --> 03:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
hour to get here and wait for
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
hours listening to all these
 
03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:55.389 align:start position:0%
hours listening to all these
heartbreaking

03:13:55.389 --> 03:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
stories and to worry that it's falling
 
03:13:59.950 --> 03:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
on De
 
03:14:03.389 --> 03:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
ears that is my fear right
 
03:14:06.269 --> 03:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
now that people are not being
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
heard because if we were we wouldn't be
 
03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.750 --> 03:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
now I'm so disappointed and I'm so ma'am
 
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%

Sienna hi hi I'm Katherine Evans I'm

from nsha and um I'm here to um oppose
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill um I want to take just a moment
 
03:14:49.790 --> 03:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
to to invite everyone to think about the
 
03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
word choice I have been thinking about
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
that a lot ever since I came into this
 
03:14:57.630 --> 03:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
room I want to thank everyone who's here
 
03:15:01.070 --> 03:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
I want to thank everyone who came who um
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
drove a long time uh maybe came last
 
03:15:06.229 --> 03:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
minute because they were nervous like me
 
03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
I was kind of scared to come I just
 
03:15:12.030 --> 03:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
never did something like this before um
 
03:15:14.590 --> 03:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
and I was you know not planning on
 
03:15:17.469 --> 03:15:17.479 align:start position:0%
talking but here I am and those are all
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
choices you know simple choices but some
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
of us have really hard
 
03:15:28.429 --> 03:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
choices um I have two children uh 13 and
 
03:15:32.110 --> 03:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
11 they're wonderful and I'm so grateful
 
03:15:34.870 --> 03:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
I have great health insurance and it's a
 
03:15:37.150 --> 03:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
good thing I do because my son needs a
 
03:15:40.750 --> 03:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
lot of support uh for uh he's um
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
autistic and um lots of therapies um
 
03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
there are women who do not have such um
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
or um as fortunate as I am um I am
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
fortunate that I did not have to make a
 
03:15:58.550 --> 03:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
choice to keep or terminate a child a
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
pregnancy um but I'm glad that I had the
 
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
choice I never thought that I wouldn't
 
03:16:08.269 --> 03:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm worried about my 11-year-old
 
03:16:11.349 --> 03:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
daughter um you know I can't help but
 
03:16:13.229 --> 03:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
think am I supposed you know will we
 
03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
have to talk about you know birth
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
control at a young age because says who
 
03:16:19.710 --> 03:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
knows what could happen I have never
 
03:16:22.349 --> 03:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
been raped I am so fortunate in all of
 
03:16:24.469 --> 03:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
those senses but there are women who are
 
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
not as fortunate my heart goes out to um
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
the women who shared their experiences
 
03:16:34.269 --> 03:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
of losing a pregnancy that was truly
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
wanted that's devastating and my heart
 
03:16:40.590 --> 03:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
goes out to them um one more thing I
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
want to say about Choice when people are
 
03:16:45.070 --> 03:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
able to adopt a child they're able to
 
03:16:47.710 --> 03:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
choose they're able to
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
choose the child that they're going to
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
adopt if someone's going to use a
 
03:16:54.189 --> 03:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
surrogate they get to choose who's going
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
to carry their baby if a person has like
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
a long history of mental illness in
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
their family like me or is on
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
anti-depressants and anxiety medicine
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
like me and they want to be a surrogate
 
03:17:08.429 --> 03:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
chances are they're not going to be
 
03:17:13.349 --> 03:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
chosen so please allow women to have a
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
choice um factchecking I I did look at
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
France to see what their abortion laws
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
were um and I just want to share real
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%

sism it's sh sorry
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Amanda shenna I'm 46
 
03:18:23.150 --> 03:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
years old I've got a couple kids um I'm
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
here from California I live in exitor
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
now um I've had one ectopic one
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
miscarriage and one abortion and two
 
03:18:33.389 --> 03:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
live births um at 17 I discovered I was
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
pregnant at 21 weeks despite uh what
 
03:18:40.110 --> 03:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
others may have said I had no uh visible
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
symptoms I continued to have my period I
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
was unaware of my pregnancy I gave birth
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
to my son after becoming pregnant by an
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
abuse Ive partner two weeks following my
 
03:18:51.189 --> 03:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
delivery I developed a severe infection
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
from retained tissue in my
 
03:18:56.269 --> 03:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
uterus I had a high fever excruciating
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
pain and couldn't walk without a DNC
 
03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
which is a dilation and cage um and
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
antibiotics I would have gone into
 
03:19:05.469 --> 03:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
septic shock and this procedure saved my
 
03:19:07.630 --> 03:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
life I want to emphasize that
 
03:19:10.030 --> 03:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthc care is complex
 
03:19:11.469 --> 03:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
there are countless pieces to this
 
03:19:14.429 --> 03:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
deeply personal puzzle medical history
 
03:19:17.550 --> 03:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
personal circumstances physical health
 
03:19:20.189 --> 03:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
mental well-being safety and
 
03:19:22.910 --> 03:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
survival no single law can capture the
 
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
intricate Realties women face when
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
making reproductive decisions and
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence has also shaped my
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
story um and the DNC procedure itself um
 
03:19:38.110 --> 03:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
is often misrepresented as being solely
 
03:19:40.830 --> 03:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
used for abortions but it's critical for
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
treating complications after childbirth
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
miscarriages and even diagnosing
 
03:19:47.830 --> 03:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
conditions that I have like endomet
 
03:19:50.429 --> 03:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
iosis unfortunately restrictive laws in
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
some states have created confusion and
 
03:19:53.710 --> 03:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
fear among Health Care Providers when
 
03:19:53.720 --> 03:19:55.309 align:start position:0%
fear among Health Care Providers when
performing

03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
performing
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
dncs for pregnancy related complications
 
03:19:59.950 --> 03:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
like incomplete
 
03:20:02.309 --> 03:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
miscarriages or
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
infections I also had an ectopic
 
03:20:06.309 --> 03:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
pregnancy at the age of
 
03:20:08.990 --> 03:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
28 um I faced it's obviously a
 
03:20:12.550 --> 03:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
life-threatening situation um and again
 
03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
they use the DNC to see if there was any
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
fetal tissue in my uterus which there
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:19.680 --> 03:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
laparoscopy

03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
laparoscopy
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
um so these experiences underscore the
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
importance of accessible reproductive
 
03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:31.189 align:start position:0%
importance of accessible reproductive
Health

03:20:31.189 --> 03:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.199 --> 03:20:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
Care

03:20:33.670 --> 03:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
Care
 
03:20:37.469 --> 03:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
um restrictive laws like House Bill 476
 
03:20:39.189 --> 03:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
could delay or deny life-saving care to
 
03:20:41.710 --> 03:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
women facing medical emergencies like
 
03:20:45.510 --> 03:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
mine and like Porsche and other women in
 
03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
Missouri um um please oppose this bill
 
03:20:50.910 --> 03:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure women continue to have access
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
to the critical nuanced care that they
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
need to survive and enclosing
 
03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care is about
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
survival not
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
politics these procedures Sav lives they
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
saved mine every restriction puts women
 
03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
at risk protect our right to critical
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and oppose House Bill 476
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much ma'am uh
 
03:21:14.830 --> 03:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
Michaels I hope I'm pronouncing this
 
03:21:16.750 --> 03:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
right schism
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
from West
 
03:21:21.269 --> 03:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
Sanbornton West
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
Sanbornton right not seeing him here I
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
guess put that aside Uh Kevin costum
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
 right and on deck and I believe our
 
03:21:34.110 --> 03:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
last witness oh no I'm sorry on Deck
 
03:21:35.469 --> 03:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
will be uh
 
03:21:39.189 --> 03:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
Patricia gadzik hi there um I'm Kevin
 
03:21:41.229 --> 03:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
costan I'm a native of New Hampshire and
 
03:21:43.870 --> 03:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
um just a concerned citizen I showed up
 
03:21:45.790 --> 03:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
today not prepared to speak or anything
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
like that but I just wanted to make a
 
03:21:50.309 --> 03:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
few observations that I don't see many
 
03:21:53.070 --> 03:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
medal medical practitioners in favor of
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was there any um I think that
 
03:21:59.670 --> 03:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
we should be more trusting to science
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
than denying it and I heard some murmur
 
03:22:04.710 --> 03:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
outside saying that you know these
 
03:22:07.389 --> 03:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners are for-profit and
 
03:22:08.670 --> 03:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
that's all they care about and I think
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's pretty
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
despicable um with that said just short
 
03:22:16.870 --> 03:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
and sweet uh If you deny science you're
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
denying life because life is science
 
03:22:22.750 --> 03:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir Patricia Gad
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
gadz I think and then I the last witness
 
03:22:32.630 --> 03:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
Peters hi I'm Patricia godzik um I am a
 
03:22:37.870 --> 03:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
hookit resident and a small business
 
03:22:41.469 --> 03:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
owner here in um New Hampshire I'm also
 
03:22:44.590 --> 03:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
a um Survivor of not only domestic
 
03:22:46.229 --> 03:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
violence from the time of I was very
 
03:22:46.239 --> 03:22:47.110 align:start position:0%
violence from the time of I was very
young

03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
young
 
03:22:53.189 --> 03:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
but also a survivor of um essay and um a
 
03:22:56.150 --> 03:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
foster mom who recently adopted
 
03:22:59.309 --> 03:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
her adoptive son who I love to death um
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
so it's really easy to say that adoption
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
is the answer to this but unless you are
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
going through the adoption process you
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
that um recently I want to tell you a
 
03:23:15.150 --> 03:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
story and I'm hoping that you're all
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
listening I have PCOS and I've been
 
03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with PCOS at a young age so I
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
was infertile for many many years um
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
after eight years of trying to have a a
 
03:23:29.710 --> 03:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
child we gave up and decided to go
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
through the TR the foster care system um
 
03:23:36.150 --> 03:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
only to magically conceive and not
 
03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:37.150 align:start position:0%
only to magically conceive and not
remember

03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:38.990 align:start position:0%
remember
conceiving

03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
conceiving
 
03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.790 align:start position:0%
conceiving
um

03:23:41.790 --> 03:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:44.950 --> 03:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
2022 New Year's Eve I found out about my
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
daughter Amelia and and I was absolutely
 
03:23:51.309 --> 03:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
in love and didn't tell anybody until we
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
were 13 weeks along we didn't find out
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
until we were 8 weeks
 
03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
along when this all happened we were so
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
blessed but if you remember in 2022
 
03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
everyone was talking about the 24-week
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
abortion man the 24-week abortion man I
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
looked at my husband and I said who
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know at 24 weeks whether they
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
want to keep a child or not and we
 
03:24:17.189 --> 03:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
laughed about it
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
until my 16
 
03:24:23.870 --> 03:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
week uh doctor's appointment and I felt
 
03:24:25.110 --> 03:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
something wrong and I asked for an
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
ultrasound and they said sorry we don't
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
do that you're going to have to wait
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
until your 20we
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
checkup they let me hear her heartbeat
 
03:24:35.590 --> 03:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
and everything was fine everything was
 
03:24:38.110 --> 03:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
normal because of covid we couldn't hear
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
my daughter's heart we could only hear
 
03:24:40.830 --> 03:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
my daughter's heartbeat we didn't get to
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
get in until 2020 22 weeks at 22 weeks
 
03:24:46.030 --> 03:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
we found out she was only measuring at
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
15 weeks and that she had a genetic
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
abnormality that made her not compatible
 
03:24:56.110 --> 03:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
with Life she had a heartbeat bands like
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
this 15 week band started in States like
 
03:25:03.189 --> 03:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
Texas that now have heartbeat
 
03:25:07.110 --> 03:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
bands in my condition I in Texas we
 
03:25:08.429 --> 03:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to go through
 
03:25:09.870 --> 03:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
termination because she had a heartbeat
 
03:25:15.550 --> 03:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
but you know what you need to have lungs
 
03:25:17.469 --> 03:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to survive survive you need
 
03:25:19.229 --> 03:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
to be able to have kidneys to be able to
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
survive and I was in hysterics I called
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
my doctor every single day and I said
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
are you sure are you sure I don't know
 
03:25:28.910 --> 03:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
what to do and because of the 24 week
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
band I had 4 days to make a
 
03:25:36.750 --> 03:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
decision four days and as I'm holding my
 
03:25:39.389 --> 03:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
daughter in my belly I had four days to
 
03:25:41.389 --> 03:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
make a decision ma'am I'm sorry you're
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh you're really over the line ask you
 
03:25:45.189 --> 03:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
to finish up your testimony to make a
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
decision whether it she could be here or
 
03:25:52.590 --> 03:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
not so I just ask that when you guys are
 
03:25:54.750 --> 03:25:54.760 align:start position:0%

ahead with today's hearing even though I
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
understand it's not likely this bill is
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to go forward um in its original
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
capacity at least um I came here today
 
03:26:31.469 --> 03:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
initially to ask you to let the bill go
 
03:26:33.070 --> 03:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
to the floor and let those in the house
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
who wanted to go on record um in favor
 
03:26:39.389 --> 03:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
of protecting babies who are paying
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
capable from having their lives ended
 
03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
apart from some of the exceptions that
 
03:26:46.469 --> 03:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
are laid out in the bill as I've sat
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
here this morning my heart goes out to
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
many women I too have experienced
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy complications I have um held
 
03:26:56.189 --> 03:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
the hands of women who have uh been
 
03:26:58.269 --> 03:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
notified their babies were not
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
compatible with life and and I I think
 
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
we all understand that when the life of
 
03:27:04.710 --> 03:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
the mother is in danger when the
 
03:27:06.990 --> 03:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
certainty of fetal demise has been
 
03:27:09.189 --> 03:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
confirmed those are not situations we're
 
03:27:11.670 --> 03:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
talking about what we are talking about
 
03:27:15.510 --> 03:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the value of two lives and uh again I
 
03:27:17.710 --> 03:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
would like to have seen this be able to
 
03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
go forward so that the rest of your
 
03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues could have the same
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
conversation uh on the house floor um
 
03:27:26.429 --> 03:27:26.439 align:start position:0%

the table um so I'm uh I uh offer this
 
03:30:35.550 --> 03:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
amendment this uh is an amendment uh a
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
non gerain Amendment to the bill it
 
03:30:42.269 --> 03:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
establishes a reporting requirement for
 
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
reporting on um abortion abortions that
 
03:30:49.750 --> 03:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
are conduct that are conducted um and it
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
requires the Department of Health and
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services basically to provide that
 
03:30:59.870 --> 03:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
information um on an annual basis um uh
 
03:31:02.469 --> 03:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
to to provide reports it contains
 
03:31:06.189 --> 03:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
Provisions for confidentiality now I I
 
03:31:08.910 --> 03:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
from discussions I've had uh with
 
03:31:12.070 --> 03:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood over the weekend I
 
03:31:14.269 --> 03:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
understand that they have
 
03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
the terms of this bill in terms of
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
whether it provides sufficient
 
03:31:24.389 --> 03:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
protection for for um uh
 
03:31:27.030 --> 03:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality um I'm going to be
 
03:31:28.429 --> 03:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
interested to hear what they have to say
 
03:31:31.189 --> 03:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
I it it seemed to me as I looked at this
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
that that it did have sufficient uh
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
protections but you know obviously I and
 
03:31:38.910 --> 03:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
and I think all of us would stand to be
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
educated if if I'm wrong on that I
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
should say so that everyone knows this
 
03:31:49.710 --> 03:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
bill is Tak literally word for word from
 
03:31:49.720 --> 03:31:50.710 align:start position:0%
bill is Tak literally word for word from
a

03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:31:54.229 --> 03:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
2016 bill I believe it was
 
03:31:57.790 --> 03:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
2016 House Bill 629 I think I've got
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
that number right um it's taken
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
literally from that and the only changes
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
that I made to that bill um was did
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
obviously change the dates of
 
03:32:13.189 --> 03:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and things like that and
 
03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:23.790 --> 03:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh in on which is on page two it begins
 
03:32:29.070 --> 03:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
at uh line 16 it it it's the the
 
03:32:31.990 --> 03:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
sentence there that that uh States a
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider or Facility Who
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
knowingly or recklessly fails to report
 
03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
the induced termination of a pregnancy
 
03:32:41.790 --> 03:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
under this section shall be guilty of a
 
03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
violation and shall be fined an amount
 
03:32:47.229 --> 03:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
not to exceed $11,000 for each offense
 
03:32:49.630 --> 03:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's other than the date changes uh
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's the only change that I made to
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
that 2016 house bill um other than that
 
03:32:58.189 --> 03:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
um that's that's all I have to say well
 
03:33:00.349 --> 03:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I should say one other thing
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and again from this
 
03:33:05.710 --> 03:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
is from discussions with various people
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
that there
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
isn't much in the way of opposition to
 
03:33:13.229 --> 03:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
the idea that there should be a
 
03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement um I as I
 
03:33:18.269 --> 03:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
understand from my discussions with par
 
03:33:20.269 --> 03:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood they are on board
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
with with uh with the idea of a
 
03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement it's just the the
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
details of what the confidentiality
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions should be that that are the
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
matter an issue I would note that as in
 
03:33:36.750 --> 03:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
the brief research I did with Mr Google
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
it appears that um there are only four
 
03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
states that don't have some kind of
 
03:33:43.870 --> 03:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement California
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
Maryland New Jersey and New Hampshire
 
03:33:48.990 --> 03:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
um so it's you know it doesn't sound
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
like this is a um red state blue State
 
03:33:55.349 --> 03:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
kind of thing um other than that um
 
03:33:57.150 --> 03:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say and to the
 
03:33:59.710 --> 03:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
extent I know the answers to any of the
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions you may have I'm happy to try
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you representative Lynn um
 
03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a substitute on the committee today
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
so um what what is the purpose of of the
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
bill why do we need reporting I guess is
 
03:34:21.309 --> 03:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at well you know
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's a really good question
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
and you know I should I I if I suspect
 
03:34:29.950 --> 03:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
you probably know this but um I'm
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
someone who is not I am not going to
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
vote for the underlying bill I mean I
 
03:34:35.950 --> 03:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
basically consider myself to be a
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
pro-choice person I favored the 24 week
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
band because I do think that even for a
 
03:34:44.429 --> 03:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
pro-choice person like me at some point
 
03:34:46.269 --> 03:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
it just gets to be too late and I think
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
24 weeks is a reasonable thing but
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
having said that I do support a
 
03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
reporting bill because I think you know
 
03:34:57.150 --> 03:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to have accurate
 
03:35:00.269 --> 03:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
information on what um on how many
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
abortions are being performed and you
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
know I I've said this before maybe last
 
03:35:09.910 --> 03:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
year in committee I think that um in
 
03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
some sense both sides of this issue um
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
there there's some
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
sentiment to uh to want to not to want
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
to not do this in new I'm not quite sure
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
why in New Hampshire but there seems to
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
be and I can't help thinking that both
 
03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
sides are afraid of what the result
 
03:35:28.750 --> 03:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
might be because if the result shows as
 
03:35:31.790 --> 03:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
I suspect it will that there are very
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
few late term abortions for example then
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know one side is going to say well
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
look why do we need these what do we
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
need a 24 restriction week restriction
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
for there aren't really very many if any
 
03:35:46.510 --> 03:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
abortions after 24 weeks anyway and most
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
of them would be allowed because there's
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
some kind of you know exceptional
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance so what do we need to have
 
03:35:54.670 --> 03:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
a 24-week ban for and the other side
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
would say wait a minute there aren't
 
03:35:58.670 --> 03:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
very many 24 week there aren't very many
 
03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
abortions after 24 weeks so what's the
 
03:36:02.950 --> 03:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
harm why don't you know maybe there are
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
some that are really you know it's just
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
outrageous so what's the harm of having
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
the 24-week ban and my sense is let's
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
get the information and then I don't
 
03:36:15.630 --> 03:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
know who will win that argument if there
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
if that is the kind of argument that's
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
made but let's at least have the
 
03:36:21.550 --> 03:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
information so that's why I support
 
03:36:25.189 --> 03:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um I have a
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
problem and I guess I need
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
advice left to my own devices and always
 
03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
wanting to hear from the public I would
 
03:36:44.429 --> 03:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
not ask you any questions now but wait
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
for other people to come before us and
 
03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:49.269 align:start position:0%
for other people to come before us and
help

03:36:49.269 --> 03:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
elaborate either support or opposition
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the amendment with the possibility
 
03:36:57.870 --> 03:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
that we might ask for you to to be
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
willing to sit in that chair
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
again um but I I'm now
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
confounded about what to do
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
because you've made some statements that
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
are very interesting but I don't think
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
address the real focus of this amendment
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
for example I have always
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
supported and it's this is a question
 
03:37:33.229 --> 03:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
but no it is a question I'm trying to
 
03:37:35.550 --> 03:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
figure out how to ask it um that see
 
03:37:37.550 --> 03:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
that that's that's usually usually you
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
can end by saying isn't that true or
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah but you know
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's disingenuous and that's not the
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
way I really like to proceed
 
03:37:48.870 --> 03:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
um I I guess what I'd like to say Mr
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
chairman is at this point I would like
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
to see the um the hearing unfold and
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that if it would
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
be appropriate we might want to ask the
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to come and sit before us
 
03:38:08.670 --> 03:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
again so that we could ask questions
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
after that with that be acceptable I
 
03:38:13.950 --> 03:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
think we could do that all right all
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
03:38:19.830 --> 03:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
sure thank you I I'm also a substitute
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
um nice to be
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
here um I'm just trying to put this in a
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
in a broader context um uh I uh you know
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
we just listened to you know close to
 
03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
four hours of of of uh testimony about
 
03:38:36.910 --> 03:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill which uh I
 
03:38:39.950 --> 03:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
understand the the depth of uh feeling
 
03:38:44.189 --> 03:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
on both sides uh and as I see this bill
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
um it is uh it doesn't have that uh
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
depth of uh controversy and feeling is
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
that fair thing to say on the reporting
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
yes I think on the reporting I think
 
03:38:58.030 --> 03:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's true I mean I you know I have we
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
have other Witnesses who may may prove
 
03:39:04.590 --> 03:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
me wrong but followup followup um
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm just again putting this in
 
03:39:09.950 --> 03:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
context so as I see it this is gathering
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
this data is useful but fair to say it's
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
not necessary
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
well I you know I guess I would I don't
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
think I I mean it depends I suppose on
 
03:39:23.950 --> 03:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
what you mean by necessary but 46 other
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
states have thought that it was
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
necessary so I tend to think for the
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
reasons I've said before um and maybe
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
for other you know other sort of Health
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
Care kind of reasons it might be
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
necessary I I think it probably I think
 
03:39:40.269 --> 03:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't wouldn't agree with you on
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
that okay fair to say we could both
 
03:39:44.790 --> 03:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
agree that it certainly would be helpful
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that a Fair that's that's all right I
 
03:39:49.710 --> 03:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
I I agree with that okay thank you any
 
03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
thank

03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%

03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
is proud of providing reproductive
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
Health Care to women across the Spectrum
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
um we have Services uh for pregnant and
 
03:40:27.189 --> 03:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
parent parenting women um all the way to
 
03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
providing abortion Services uh to women
 
03:40:31.469 --> 03:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
who need and want to access those those
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
services and uh we are proud to be the
 
03:40:37.110 --> 03:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
home of specialized uh um obstetric
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
services for women who are in need of
 
03:40:40.910 --> 03:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
abortions at a later
 
03:40:44.189 --> 03:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
term we believe that access to Quality
 
03:40:45.750 --> 03:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
protected Health that
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
does Ensure Better Health outcomes and
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's in these rooms where we're
 
03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
always working to balance um protected
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
health information for our patients the
 
03:40:58.110 --> 03:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
safety of our providers and ensuring
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
that we as a state have access to
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
Quality comprehensive data um to drive
 
03:41:06.150 --> 03:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
better health outcomes and so when I
 
03:41:07.830 --> 03:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
think about that I know you don't have
 
03:41:10.030 --> 03:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
to think about vaccine Registries or
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
cancer Registries in this committee but
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
we do in other committees and so um I
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that as we as I
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
testify on this amendment that I'm
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
underscoring it's really important for
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
us that we're balancing the right of
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
privacy and uh collection of of health
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
information representative Lynn is
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
correct there are 46 other states that
 
03:41:32.630 --> 03:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
do collect this information um and this
 
03:41:34.269 --> 03:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
concept is not new as representative
 
03:41:36.149 --> 03:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
Lynn pointed out this was contemplated
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
in 2016 but it's also being contemplated
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the Senate there's a bill Senate Bill
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
36 uh that we just testified on last
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
week and um I believe the Senate is
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
going to be doing some work on that bill
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
we do have some concerns about this
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and I and I have to oppose
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I'm committed to
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
working on Senate Bill 33 with the
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
Senate and hopefully with this committee
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
as it as it crosses over um as it
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
crosses over here one thing that is
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
really important for the record we in
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have a really low volume
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
of later um term abortions here in New
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so any data into a
 
03:42:14.990 --> 03:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
registry or um a collection entity like
 
03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:15.910 align:start position:0%
registry or um a collection entity like
this

03:42:15.910 --> 03:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
it we're going to have to be really sure
 
03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
that we're buttoning up privacy
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
protections because of that low volume
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very easy to identify
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
patients and providers if that is not
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
done in a protected um thoughtful way
 
03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
03:42:34.349 --> 03:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's our testimony thank
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
03:42:39.870 --> 03:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
maner thank you um does this bill comply
 
03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:40.870 align:start position:0%
maner thank you um does this bill comply
with

03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
HIPPA so um it looks to be that this
 
03:42:44.359 --> 03:42:45.710 align:start position:0%
HIPPA so um it looks to be that this
amendment

03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I have concerns about uh Hippa
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
because this amendment would require the
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
the collection of abortion statistics to
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
a non-hp covered entity this collection
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
entity would be um through our security
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh Secretary of State and so um our
 
03:43:03.870 --> 03:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is not a hip cover
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
entity and for that reason we would be
 
03:43:07.630 --> 03:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
privacy are you specific are you
 
03:43:12.349 --> 03:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
specifically concerned that it does not
 
03:43:17.189 --> 03:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative mcfar
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
further to that last
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
question I I want to take this in two
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
parts you spoke to concerns around the
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
anonymity of the data and I'll come back
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
to that sure I if you
 
03:43:40.030 --> 03:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
accept uh arguendo that the an anonymity
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
achieved by saying over 20,000 is
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient then could you explain what
 
03:43:49.590 --> 03:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
it is in the nature of the data that
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
would be submitted to the Secretary of
 
03:43:54.030 --> 03:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
State's office uh that would in fact
 
03:43:56.830 --> 03:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
constitute Phi under
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hippa um well over there are not over
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
20,000 abortions uh after the after 18
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
weeks that are being provided in the
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire in fact there's
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
fewer than a 100 from our entity alone I
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
think your misunderstanding I'm
 
03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
referring to the the part of the
 
03:44:14.229 --> 03:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
amendment where it talks about
 
03:44:17.229 --> 03:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
anonymizing data uh at least to the
 
03:44:19.950 --> 03:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
level of and let me find the actual
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
reference here um if the population of
 
03:44:26.510 --> 03:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
the municipality exceeds 20,000 you know
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
but again let's come back to the
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
question around how it's anonymized and
 
03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
and first of all address as written in
 
03:44:37.710 --> 03:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment the data that would be
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
submitted to the Secretary of State's
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
office what is in the nature of that
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
data that you think is covered under
 
03:44:47.070 --> 03:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hippa so there I so my testimony is that
 
03:44:48.750 --> 03:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
there that the Secretary of State's
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
office Vital Records is not a hpoc
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
covered entity I I heard that so this
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
would not be protected health
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
information and I would have concerns
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
about this amendment um flying in the
 
03:45:05.229 --> 03:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
face of of Hippo as in totality would
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
you agree that if I sent a newspaper
 
03:45:10.229 --> 03:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
article containing information about how
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
many abortions there had been in New
 
03:45:13.870 --> 03:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the Secretary of State's
 
03:45:15.790 --> 03:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
office that the secretary of state would
 
03:45:17.550 --> 03:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
still not be a hip covered entity and
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
that that would be frankly irrelevant so
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know would you agree to
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm not sure I I I'm not sure
 
03:45:27.070 --> 03:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to explore that with you but
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how to answer that right
 
03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
now okay is there any further testimony
 
03:45:32.510 --> 03:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you could provide that would help
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
us understand more about the nature of
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
your specific concerns with regard to
 
03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
Hippa I am happy to work on the concept
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
of of an abortion collection process
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I just don't think
 
03:45:47.630 --> 03:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
this bill the vehicle thank you any
 
03:45:47.640 --> 03:45:48.469 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank

03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
Montgomery we can do
 
03:46:28.149 --> 03:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Abby Rogers I'm
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%

come to to speak about the amendment
 
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
today um we have some serious concerns
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
around certain elements of amendment
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
25318 uh one of the top priorities of
 
03:46:56.149 --> 03:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
Services is the health of mothers and
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
babies with the objective to promote
 
03:47:01.469 --> 03:47:01.479 align:start position:0%

adolescents um I'll let you

continue so the amendment number 2500
 
03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
31h would require the division of Vital
 
03:47:19.070 --> 03:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
Records Administration under the
 
03:47:21.189 --> 03:47:21.199 align:start position:0%

induct uh indued the termination of
 
03:47:29.309 --> 03:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
pregnancy using the New Hampshire V
 
03:47:32.189 --> 03:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
records information Network never
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
systems so the proposed uh Amendment
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
states that the termination of pregnancy
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
statistic data will be released from Nan
 
03:47:45.790 --> 03:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
to the department DHHS uh to to analyze
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
and compile um an annual report the
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
report will contain and aggregate
 
03:47:53.710 --> 03:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
statistical summary of all induced
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
determination of pregnancy performed in
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and will be available to
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
the public starting on November 1st
 
03:48:05.790 --> 03:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
2026 the proposed legislation requires
 
03:48:09.229 --> 03:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
the department uh DHHS to assign a
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
confidential number to each health care
 
03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
provider and medical facility that are
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
required to submit the induced
 
03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
determination of pregnancy data on a
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
department uh created electronic forms
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
so the amendment uh unfortunately does
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
not uh contemplate contemplate the
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
needed appropriation to support data
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
collection review validation preparation
 
03:48:40.510 --> 03:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
and posting um of this
 
03:48:43.710 --> 03:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
report the department has concerns with
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:48:48.790 --> 03:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for certain data elements
 
03:48:51.790 --> 03:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh protection of privacy and alignment
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
with the current statue in addition uh
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
the department is a hippoc covered
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
entity so the department is concerned
 
03:49:02.149 --> 03:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the lack of clarity around Hippa
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
protection in the amendment languages in
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
order to protect the privacy of the
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
protected health information collected
 
03:49:14.110 --> 03:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
there is a need to reference to Hippa
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
law in including definition of
 
03:49:18.990 --> 03:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health um prohibited
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
purposes and requirements for an
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
attestation for disc colure or use of
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
the um protective health information
 
03:49:31.469 --> 03:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
potentially related to productive health
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
and currently there are specific statute
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh that governs how V record statistic
 
03:49:41.189 --> 03:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
data is shared between the division of V
 
03:49:42.790 --> 03:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
record Administration under the
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and the department
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS if this bill moves forward this may
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
require the statute Chang to include uh
 
03:49:55.630 --> 03:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
the induced determination of pregancy
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
data information and how it will be
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
shared with the
 
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
Department it is also unclear how this
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
legislation will align with the Federal
 
03:50:07.469 --> 03:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
Life protection act reporting
 
03:50:10.149 --> 03:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
requirement which is under the statute
 
03:50:10.159 --> 03:50:11.469 align:start position:0%
requirement which is under the statute
RSA

03:50:11.469 --> 03:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
329 um column 45 uh which we have
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
included in our written Tes
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
monies so while no fiscal impact note
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
was requested the department estimate an
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh an approximately of
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
$150,000 in staff resources plus $10,000
 
03:50:37.149 --> 03:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
for training in the fiscal year 26 for
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
data collection review validation and
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
Reporting and please note that this
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
estimate does not include the resources
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
needed for the division of vle Records
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
under the Secretary of State to create
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh the required modules in their never
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
system the department understands its
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility in protecting privacy and
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
securing this information which is why
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
ex streeming care must be taken in
 
03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
defining potential data elements and
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring that adequate resources are
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
available to support support uh the
 
03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
development of necessary systems and
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations because of the
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
technical requirements and financial
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
considerations it is unlikely the data
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
will be securely reported and collected
 
03:51:29.429 --> 03:51:29.439 align:start position:0%
by January
 
03:51:33.070 --> 03:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
2026 and I'll hand it over to
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
as thank you chawe um the over the past
 
03:51:38.910 --> 03:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
decade the general court has considered
 
03:51:40.590 --> 03:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
several ways as representative Lynn has
 
03:51:43.149 --> 03:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned previous bills uh dating back
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
from 20 I think you said 2016 maybe um
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
we also found um in our history um
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
various abortion uh statistic bills back
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
in 2022 as well um and the general court
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
has has considered several ways in which
 
03:51:58.349 --> 03:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
to collect abortion statistics but
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
currently um the department has not been
 
03:52:02.910 --> 03:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
has not been given authority to do so um
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
currently as um one of our previous
 
03:52:06.189 --> 03:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned um there is Senate
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
Bel 36 which the department did testify
 
03:52:11.269 --> 03:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
on last week as well as some other folks
 
03:52:13.710 --> 03:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate health and human Human
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
Services committee
 
03:52:16.830 --> 03:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh that bill is proposing a method which
 
03:52:19.229 --> 03:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
may have fewer technical concerns than
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
what has been being proposed in this
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I know that there were um uh
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
it is being worked on um regardless of
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
the method um the cost of Hipp hippoc
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
compliant data collection and Analysis
 
03:52:32.830 --> 03:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
must be considered there are currently
 
03:52:34.710 --> 03:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
no funds budgeted for this purpose now
 
03:52:36.990 --> 03:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
or contemplated in future budgets and
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that the department had
 
03:52:41.670 --> 03:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
worked on um for that other bill would
 
03:52:45.630 --> 03:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
um have been um quite expensive over 900
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh $900,000 for a HIPPA secure uh
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
database and as well as some staff
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
positions so um we're happy to take any
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions um on Upon Our
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
concerns thank you any questions yes
 
03:53:02.950 --> 03:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative uh McFarland thank you so
 
03:53:05.870 --> 03:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um further
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the the testimony we've heard from
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
you and from the last individual I'd
 
03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
just like to understand would you agree
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
that under Hippa information that is
 
03:53:18.550 --> 03:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
deidentified uh as defined by removing
 
03:53:20.990 --> 03:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
direct and indirect identifiers is not
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
considered Phi and therefore would be
 
03:53:27.790 --> 03:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
HIPPA thank you for the question first
 
03:53:32.590 --> 03:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
of all I'm not really a hip-hop privacy
 
03:53:36.189 --> 03:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
officer per se but whatever we release
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
related to health risk we also take into
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
account on the suppression rules so to
 
03:53:44.429 --> 03:53:44.439 align:start position:0%
suppress like little numbers that even
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
even in the state level uh to avoid this
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
kind like identifications so um for the
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
general um reporting we do report for
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
example um asthma rate uh in the state
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire applying the separation
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
rule in it and for this kind of
 
03:54:08.670 --> 03:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
reporting it will not be um revealed the
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
Phi and that's what we are allowed to
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
report so forgive me if I misunderstood
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony I I was under the
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
impression from what you were saying
 
03:54:22.110 --> 03:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
that the the thrust of your argument is
 
03:54:25.469 --> 03:54:25.479 align:start position:0%
that this amendment would contravene
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
hipper but you're saying you're not a
 
03:54:29.309 --> 03:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
hipper expert is that right sorry again
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so we are
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
talking about two parts to collect the
 
03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
data that would be under our Hippa um
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether we have the authority legal
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
authority to collect this kind of a data
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
in to us to report the data we also need
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
to follow the Hippa and then to report
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
the Hippa if it's aggregated level with
 
03:54:52.830 --> 03:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
implementation and also Safeguard
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
methods implemented then we will be able
 
03:54:58.349 --> 03:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
to release the data that without U
 
03:55:01.229 --> 03:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
violating the Hippa so those are the two
 
03:55:05.550 --> 03:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
um um two two two things two component
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we we are talking about in this
 
03:55:10.110 --> 03:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you thank you
 
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sher thank you um
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
fair to say dhss has been uh engaging in
 
03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
strategies I'm looking at uh the letter
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
to support healthy pregnancy and early
 
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
childhood and reduce unintended
 
03:55:26.070 --> 03:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancies particularly among
 
03:55:29.149 --> 03:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
adolescent before the existence of this
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
bill better to
 
03:55:34.910 --> 03:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
say uh you actually have to say a word
 
03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
rather than just not that's correct um
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
and this bill would improve that uh dhss
 
03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
say you mean the qu is it the question
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
whether this bill will improve our
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
ability to to provide this transact to
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
develop continue to promote strategies
 
03:56:02.189 --> 03:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
to deal with um healthy pregnancies
 
03:56:04.910 --> 03:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
early childhood and reducing unintended
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
pregnancies this would improve your
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
ability Gathering these statistics would
 
03:56:10.950 --> 03:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
improve your ability to do
 
03:56:13.950 --> 03:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
that you want this one I thank you for
 
03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
um certainly as uh you know collecting
 
03:56:19.510 --> 03:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
data is important to our work I'm not
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
sure how how it would change what we're
 
03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
currently doing I mean it would inform
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure how we would how would
 
03:56:27.309 --> 03:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
it be improved what would
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
be other purposes what what other value
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
would it have beyond what we've just
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
talked about collecting the
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
data um well for us the um the the data
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
statistics we don't currently collect
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
those statistics um it's the obviously
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
ly the legislature's decision whether we
 
03:56:48.189 --> 03:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
move forward with data collection for
 
03:56:50.590 --> 03:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
these statistics so uh we don't
 
03:56:51.950 --> 03:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
currently collect them so I I don't
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
really have an answer to that one okay
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
um I just want to
 
03:57:00.630 --> 03:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
um uh provide more information that uh
 
03:57:02.349 --> 03:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
we collect data under our legal
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
Authority so if this bills also um
 
03:57:08.309 --> 03:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
provide enough legal Authority for DHHS
 
03:57:11.710 --> 03:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
under hippoc um privacy rules and also
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
the St statute Etc uh then then we will
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
be able to um collect the data and then
 
03:57:21.870 --> 03:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
for the program areas where is internal
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
external uh who will need to use the
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
data to make the data more useful so
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
from the data standpoint that is
 
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
something that we have been continue
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
doing whether it's collecting this uh
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
data set or other health data set as
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
well so uh let me just one more followup
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
you've had three already if you want to
 
03:57:41.630 --> 03:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
ask another question in a minute I'll
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
have representative bergon ask a
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
question fair enough we can get back you
 
03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'll be quick thank you very much I
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
was just curious about the data I don't
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
know if there are other programs that
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
you've done this with but do other
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
departments like make requests from some
 
03:57:59.229 --> 03:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
of that data is that available to people
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
or can you just go and look it up or is
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
that something that we should make a
 
03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
request for but I'm just curious because
 
03:58:07.710 --> 03:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
I would probably have a lot of curiosity
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
on some of that data so uh thank you for
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
the question so if I uh understand your
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
question correctly are you asking
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
whether the abortion data is available
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
to us uh right now department is not um
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
collecting the the abortion data so well
 
03:58:26.349 --> 03:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if this was to go
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
through can other people make requests
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
with that data or is it guarding um this
 
03:58:35.030 --> 03:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
will actually fall back to the hipop
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
reproductive um rules that we will need
 
03:58:40.830 --> 03:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
to confirm with our uh hipop privacy
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
officer um so this this is the
 
03:58:46.110 --> 03:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
information that I gather from our
 
03:58:49.710 --> 03:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
privacy officer that the the abortion is
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
now for under reproductive health and
 
03:58:54.269 --> 03:58:54.279 align:start position:0%
then there is a new Hippa rule that
 
03:58:56.670 --> 03:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
regulate that part so sorry I do not
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
have the question uh answer to your
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
question but we are happy to get back to
 
03:59:02.349 --> 03:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
you well thank you I'm just glad to know
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
we have a privacy officer so thanks any
 
03:59:07.229 --> 03:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
other questions from any other members I
 
03:59:08.830 --> 03:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't your subs I don't know
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
what your name okay uh representative
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
lane lane thank you um uh thank you for
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you and I just
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
kind of spaced out you were talking
 
03:59:22.149 --> 03:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
about there a fiscal note but there is
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note on this
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you uh we were we had
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
provided a fiscal note on S sp36 in the
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
senate or we're working on that we were
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
not requested to um assess this for
 
03:59:35.950 --> 03:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact but we just included that
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
information what we thought would we if
 
03:59:41.550 --> 03:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
this um Amendment were um enacted what
 
03:59:43.149 --> 03:59:43.159 align:start position:0%
what the cost would be to the department
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
and we put that in our test
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
testimony you're
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative sh did you want
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
to follow up I'll pass thanks thank you
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:01.149 --> 04:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
much uh Kayla monom do you want to go
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
red button red means go yes um thank you
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
Kayla mon I'm very nice to um be back uh
 
04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
vice president of public affairs for
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood Northern New England
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to clarify a couple of
 
04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
things um I actually put on my pink card
 
04:00:43.309 --> 04:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
support anap POS because I didn't really
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
know exactly what I want to say here but
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
to be clear we do we do oppose this
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
amendment as
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
drafted however uh we do not oppose the
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
underlying concept of this type of data
 
04:00:58.670 --> 04:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
collection so uh representative Lane
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
asked earlier what the purpose of this
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
and we would say that we are fully
 
04:01:05.349 --> 04:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
recognizing that when we have good
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
Public Health Data when we have good
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
when we have good data Imports we get
 
04:01:11.630 --> 04:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
good Public Health outcomes and if the
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to create better
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
Public Health outcomes if we're all in
 
04:01:17.510 --> 04:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
agreement on that then that is certainly
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
something that Planned Parenthood would
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
um be interested in working um on a bill
 
04:01:26.910 --> 04:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
that would do just that um we are plan
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
parent is a three-state organization so
 
04:01:30.269 --> 04:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
we have health centers across Maine
 
04:01:31.870 --> 04:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont in New Hampshire we have 15
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
Health Centers plus teleah health and
 
04:01:35.550 --> 04:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in Maine and Vermont
 
04:01:38.349 --> 04:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
already do this so this would not be
 
04:01:39.870 --> 04:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
something that would be that we would
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
oppose to be doing because our
 
04:01:44.110 --> 04:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues do it uh but they have a
 
04:01:48.830 --> 04:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
different way of doing it um and we also
 
04:01:51.790 --> 04:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
provide data to The gutmacher Institute
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
um which is on your testimony um
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative berson asked if you could
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
see this data if you wanted to Google
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
and you go to the G marer Institute and
 
04:02:04.790 --> 04:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
you wanted to Google um New Hampshire
 
04:02:06.510 --> 04:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
abortions that number would be there
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
because we voluntarily provide that
 
04:02:13.149 --> 04:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
information to them uh we are confident
 
04:02:15.550 --> 04:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
that they uh we're confident in their
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that that data is
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
collected in a way that is secure and
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
that there would be no data breaches and
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're confident that what they do with
 
04:02:26.070 --> 04:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
that information is to benefit public
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
health so we have no problem providing
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
that information uh to The gutmacher
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
Institute and I believe the other
 
04:02:33.790 --> 04:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
abortion providers in New Hampshire do
 
04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
the same as well um but of course uh
 
04:02:40.990 --> 04:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
like all laws the devils in the details
 
04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
right and I think we can all agree that
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
when it comes
 
04:02:49.269 --> 04:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
to Private health care data uh it needs
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
to be secure and uh we can't be working
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
on anything that would jeopardize or
 
04:02:58.950 --> 04:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
compromise safety security or privacy of
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
patients and also providers
 
04:03:05.710 --> 04:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
um and we have seen this bill as uh
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
chairman Lyn mentioned this was from
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
this is a bill from 2016 so we have seen
 
04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
it I would say every year maybe every
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
other year we've seen different versions
 
04:03:17.429 --> 04:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
of this bill um often it was in a house
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
HHS um and every year it's gotten a
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
little bit different we've gotten a
 
04:03:21.950 --> 04:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
little more comfortable with it we've
 
04:03:25.630 --> 04:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
worked on it we've made some changes um
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
this kind of takes us back though so uh
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
like previous speakers mentioned uh
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 36 was heard last week in
 
04:03:35.550 --> 04:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
the house that is something that we are
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
we know it's not in final form yet there
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
is a fiscal Note coming we went in last
 
04:03:42.990 --> 04:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
week and we made five suggestions to
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
that particular bill um and I'd be happy
 
04:03:47.149 --> 04:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
to walk through some of those
 
04:03:49.309 --> 04:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
suggestions um but for the amendment
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at today right in
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
front of us there's um just a couple of
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
fundamental flaws that I just want to
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
point out of reasons why we're opposing
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
this particular bill um one being that
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
we think the data should be aggregated
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
and not incident
 
04:04:02.880 --> 04:04:04.590 align:start position:0%
and not incident
reporting

04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:04:08.349 --> 04:04:08.359 align:start position:0%
um we again because just for privacy
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
purposes we think that's really
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
important we don't want um anyone facing
 
04:04:13.710 --> 04:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
threats of violence no no one wants
 
04:04:17.950 --> 04:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
wants that no one wants that um and we
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about Hippa the
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records who I don't
 
04:04:23.229 --> 04:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
speak for and is not here but um they
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
don't regularly deal with this type of
 
04:04:28.229 --> 04:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh Healthcare information it's more like
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
birth and death and um they just don't
 
04:04:31.710 --> 04:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
that's just not something that they're
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
that they do
 
04:04:37.469 --> 04:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I know that Miss Tanner
 
04:04:38.670 --> 04:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that as
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
well um and then this um one thing
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh important to note about and
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use Maine as an example
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
because we have health centers there and
 
04:04:50.590 --> 04:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with it the way Maine
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
collects data is they have a secure
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
online portal so we our providers put
 
04:04:58.429 --> 04:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
the information directly into the portal
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
so if DHHS and when they have a uh
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note could create a portal A
 
04:05:07.910 --> 04:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
system that is hippoc compliant it is
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
secure it we the providers know exactly
 
04:05:12.030 --> 04:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
what to do then that would work but this
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of you doesn't have
 
04:05:16.590 --> 04:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
um really any information about how that
 
04:05:19.630 --> 04:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
data is going to be collected so those
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
are our concerns with this amendment in
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
front of you but like I said Senate Bill
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
36 in the house um in the Senate sorry
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
um is being worked on um and I'd be
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
happy to offer the five suggestions that
 
04:05:34.189 --> 04:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
we put in on that bill but I realize
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's not in front of you so um I think
 
04:05:40.030 --> 04:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
I can pause there and just um you know
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
reiterate that we are more than happy to
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
work with you all on
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
um some type of Bill that gets to a
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
place where we can all be confident that
 
04:05:54.750 --> 04:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
this data is being securely inputed and
 
04:05:57.870 --> 04:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
used for the right reasons um uh but
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of you uh is
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
something that we would that we oppose
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
as written happy to take questions thank
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
you representative uh Sher um would it
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
be fair to say that the Senate bill
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
right now is probably the better vehicle
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what uh Planned Parenthood
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh cares about in terms of privacy than
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's currently
 
04:06:22.510 --> 04:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
written yes and um the sponsor of the
 
04:06:24.670 --> 04:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
bill said that that bill is not
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
finalized yet either they're waiting on
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
their fiscal note and then there's some
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
areas that they um are looking to clean
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
up a little bit the the amendment the
 
04:06:34.750 --> 04:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor said that it's more of a
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
placeholder right now but I would agree
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
that when we're comparing these two
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
bills side by side which I know you
 
04:06:42.030 --> 04:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
don't have in front of you but that um
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
bill would be a better vehicle for
 
04:06:47.469 --> 04:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
confidentiality thank
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
you representative pel thank you and
 
04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
said that in um that you already report
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statistics to gut maler
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
and if
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
so how do you report on the aggregate of
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
abortions that are performed or do you
 
04:07:07.710 --> 04:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
or do you report based on the type of
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
abortion that's performed or the um a
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
age of gation so we report based on what
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
they ask us to report so they're not
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
always going to be asking us for the
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
same thing but we always report in the
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
aggregate we don't do individualized
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
incident reporting which is why we feel
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know a much more secure way
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
of doing our
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
reporting yes
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so to um
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's um question or
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
comment earlier in his
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
testimony um he thought that possibly we
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
would be able to differentiate um early
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
abortion versus late term abortions
 
04:07:47.229 --> 04:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
would that is you do
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
not report based on the length of the
 
04:07:56.269 --> 04:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
so you I don't know what has been
 
04:08:00.910 --> 04:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
recently reported but you can go on
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
gutmacher in Institute website and look
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
to see if those are you know things that
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
are being reported but I will say it
 
04:08:12.910 --> 04:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill does require gational
 
04:08:12.920 --> 04:08:14.189 align:start position:0%
this this bill does require gational
reporting

04:08:14.189 --> 04:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
one way that you could make that more
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
secure is to say an estimated gational
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
range um so there's a couple of ways
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
that we could improve that um but if you
 
04:08:27.070 --> 04:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
know planed Parenthood of course follows
 
04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
all state and federal laws so if we're
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
asked to be reported on that we
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
certainly would but there's ways that we
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
can make sure that we're not de
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
identifying patients that is really
 
04:08:38.830 --> 04:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
important when we live in a small state
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a lot of um a lot of
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
abortion numbers in General and so we
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that no patient is
 
04:08:49.950 --> 04:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
being de being reidentified um that is
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
definitely our priority and I'm and I'm
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone in this room agrees
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
that that is a priority as well no one
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
wants that personal Health Data um being
 
04:09:01.149 --> 04:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
public are there any other questions for
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
this witness yeah representative
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
McFarland further to representative
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
pel's questions uh let me make sure I
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
understand before I get to the thrust of
 
04:09:13.109 --> 04:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
my question am I right in understanding
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
that when you were talking about the
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
submissions that you make to the good
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
marker Institute that you regard those
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
as deidentified data yes yeah it's
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
aggregated data yep okay and you you
 
04:09:27.630 --> 04:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
talked about Maine as an example where
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
they have a secure online portal as you
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
put it the submissions that Planned
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
Parenthood makes in the state of Maine
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
are they submissions of identified data
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
or deidentified data um I believe it's
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
incident reporting so deidentified but
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh so identified however it is it's
 
04:09:51.990 --> 04:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
secure and it is so Maine has um a state
 
04:09:54.109 --> 04:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
level CDC so if you drive through
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
Augusta you'll see the building right
 
04:09:58.590 --> 04:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
there and it is information that goes to
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
this like state level CDC which is
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
hippoc compliant um they've been doing
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
this for a long time so I don't know
 
04:10:07.389 --> 04:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
exactly how this came about or why but I
 
04:10:09.309 --> 04:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
know that they've made some tweaks to it
 
04:10:11.109 --> 04:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
um in order to ensure more patient
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
privacy taking away a few um reporting
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
ing you know things that just weren't
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
necessary anymore um but there is a
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
agreement between abortion providers in
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
the state Dom main that that data is
 
04:10:23.950 --> 04:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
always going to be secure because they
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
have this additional level of um of
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
support through this state level CDC so
 
04:10:32.229 --> 04:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
am I correct in understanding then that
 
04:10:33.630 --> 04:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying that in the case of the
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
state of
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
Maine they uh have this secure online
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
portal which happens to be HP compliant
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore can accept identifi data
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the case of the good Market Institute
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
the reason that you're able to submit
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
that information is because it is
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
deidentified and therefore does not fall
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
under hipper is that right that's
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
04:10:56.149 --> 04:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
you any other questions on this witness
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:05.710 --> 04:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
you Meg and I apologize over B thank you
 
04:11:05.720 --> 04:11:06.590 align:start position:0%
you Meg and I apologize over B thank you
thank

04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:11:06.600 --> 04:11:10.630 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
oops thank you um I spoke earlier I'm a
 
04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in um a three Hospital health
 
04:11:20.670 --> 04:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
system and I'm a native New Hampshire
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
resident um and I did just want to voice
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
my opposition to this amendment um as
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
it's written I agree that it would
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
probably be reasonable to collect data
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
um because the majority plurality of
 
04:11:36.790 --> 04:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
states do um collect data and send that
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
to the CDC but I do have concerns about
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
privacy um I'm not a hip expert but I've
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
have been adjacent to it it for 20 years
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
working in healthcare and I will say
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we are very concerned
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
about um data that can be used to
 
04:11:53.630 --> 04:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
potentially identify people even though
 
04:11:55.870 --> 04:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like it might be um neutral
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
data such as age because if you have a
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
patient who's from a very small town and
 
04:12:03.870 --> 04:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
you require that they record their age
 
04:12:06.189 --> 04:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
and other features like that data
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
becomes more likely to be identifiable
 
04:12:12.109 --> 04:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
um that would be one concern of mine um
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
also quote the American College of
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians and gynecologists they are
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to any reporting requirements
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
that are um disproportionate to the risk
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
um so I um don't know that the way the
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill is written that we're going to um
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
add value to Providers to have to have
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
them submit monthly into a portal or
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
some other um submission mechanism and
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
then I'm not I'm not sure if familiar
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative um if all the other 46
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
states have this $1,000 penalty for
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance which was a little bit of
 
04:12:55.149 --> 04:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
a concern of mine as well um I was also
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about how this is going to be
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
getting financed um it's um some
 
04:13:03.510 --> 04:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
additional administrative burden both
 
04:13:05.630 --> 04:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
for any Hospital Health Care system or
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
provider and also the state um in a time
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
when we have a Statewide hiring freeze
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
so we have to find funds to create this
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
portal potentially or whatever mechanism
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
staff positions to monitor to this data
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
um so again um not inherently imposed to
 
04:13:25.469 --> 04:13:25.479 align:start position:0%
better data collection but not in this
 
04:13:28.590 --> 04:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
format of this Bill thank you thank you
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
any questions of this witness see
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh trip uh thank you
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:44.109 --> 04:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh I believe you said that uh
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
depending on the data
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
requested that it may be I per it may be
 
04:13:50.439 --> 04:13:51.790 align:start position:0%
requested that it may be I per it may be
possible

04:13:51.790 --> 04:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
to identify the
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
patient yes um in my experience um again
 
04:14:00.990 --> 04:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not a Hipp professional but just in
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
my experience working in healthcare we
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
get concerned when you start collecting
 
04:14:08.750 --> 04:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
granular data about people who would be
 
04:14:10.590 --> 04:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
potentially from a small population area
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
if you say this patient was a
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
25-year-old woman from a town with only
 
04:14:15.630 --> 04:14:15.640 align:start position:0%
you know 40
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
people like she could be re could be
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably identified in that scenario
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of scenario that I'd be
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about um so like measures like
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
patient age um I don't know that they
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily add value um and again maybe
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
if like a secure hippo like a fully
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
hippoc compliant portal would be created
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
but um I think that will add some time
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
in an expense that might not have been
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
considered in this
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative Morton thank you um and
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for speaking
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
today are there any other health
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
statistics that are not
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
reported I'm not an expert in public
 
04:14:59.349 --> 04:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
health reporting um so I'm like what do
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
you mean like to whom and about what
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
what health measures well I mean a few
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
years ago I mean world meter was a
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
website it's not part of the CDC it's a
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
non hippoc compliant website I guess um
 
04:15:14.590 --> 04:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
and it reported everything about covid
 
04:15:16.750 --> 04:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
the website still exists talks about
 
04:15:18.590 --> 04:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
number of people who die every day and
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
and so forth all kinds of St statistics
 
04:15:24.630 --> 04:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
like that um the number of flu uh
 
04:15:26.710 --> 04:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
incidents and deaths and all that that's
 
04:15:29.070 --> 04:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
reported um I'm just wondering are there
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
any other health statistics that are not
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
reported is this like an anomaly is it
 
04:15:34.319 --> 04:15:35.070 align:start position:0%
reported is this like an anomaly is it
by

04:15:35.070 --> 04:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
itself um I think your examples are not
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
analogous because those are public
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
health which is a very different um
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
environment and obviously you know like
 
04:15:49.630 --> 04:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
abortion is not contagious um so um from
 
04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
a public health perspective I I um for
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
example I don't know of a registry like
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
let's say we create this registry
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
because we're concerned about
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
complications right like abortions
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
generally have a complication rate of 2%
 
04:16:05.309 --> 04:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh a hip or a knee replacement
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
complication rate could be 2 to 5% so
 
04:16:09.790 --> 04:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any state registry
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's saying oh we need to track every
 
04:16:13.590 --> 04:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
hip and Joint procedure
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
for complications um like that's kind of
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
the an analogy I came up with um so um I
 
04:16:22.429 --> 04:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
mean there's cancer Registries and like
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
cancer data out there but
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
um infectious disease is its own game as
 
04:16:29.710 --> 04:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
far as like kind of like data reporting
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
goes in in my experience right and and
 
04:16:35.469 --> 04:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
when you mention cancer that's I don't
 
04:16:37.790 --> 04:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
think that's uh contagious either
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other things that
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
are reported that are not contagious so
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
is there a question
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
I guess I guess the question is is this
 
04:16:48.269 --> 04:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
by itself aside from the fact that it's
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
not a contagious uh situation I think
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
she answered that okay yeah like I don't
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of like numbers that get
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
reported to the state about like how
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
many patients have diabetes or you know
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
what I mean um but that is also like not
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
a particular purview of mine any other
 
04:17:10.750 --> 04:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:17:28.429 --> 04:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.870 --> 04:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hoy uh it's Hitt Mr chair but I've heard
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
every possible
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
mispronunciation I apologize speaking
 
04:17:39.550 --> 04:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
for Cornerstone today Cornerstone is the
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
only full-time Christian advocacy
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire we work
 
04:17:47.070 --> 04:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
with an advocate for over a 100 churches
 
04:17:49.469 --> 04:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
around the state and in this most recent
 
04:17:52.149 --> 04:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
election Cornerstone endorsed 159
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
candidates of whom 138 were elected with
 
04:18:01.389 --> 04:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
only to the bill to the amendment Mr
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
chair may I speak just giving a
 
04:18:05.429 --> 04:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
background of his organization I assume
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
04:18:09.630 --> 04:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
right I'm speaking on cornerstone's
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to the committee's
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
vote on this amendment Mr chair of the
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
138 candidates that Cornerstone endorsed
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
with only two or three exceptions
 
04:18:22.950 --> 04:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone screened for not just
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
whether people were pro-life in some
 
04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
abstract theoretical sense where perhaps
 
04:18:29.790 --> 04:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
Jesus Will enact pro-life policy at the
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
end of days but whether they would
 
04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
support specific incremental and
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
moderate abortion restrictions now some
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
of those 138 Representatives have
 
04:18:42.269 --> 04:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
changed their policies many in the last
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
7 2 hours but nonetheless dozens of
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
districts voted for candidates they
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
believed would support moderate abortion
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions if not just the 64% of the
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
state that supports moderate
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions but the 10% of the state
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
that is very strongly pro-life is not
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
even permitted to lose a floor vote on a
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
moderate abortion restriction I'm going
 
04:19:07.030 --> 04:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
to have to ask you at this point are you
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
speaking about the
 
04:19:10.750 --> 04:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
amendment about two sentences left Mr
 
04:19:12.429 --> 04:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
chair yes I am speaking in opposition to
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
the the amendment thank you uh then the
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
small r republican process is not
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
functioning and for that reason I would
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
ask that if the committee does exec this
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
bill today it vote in opposition to the
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
amendment and I would welcome any
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair okay thank you any
 
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
04:19:35.109 --> 04:19:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
you last witness I have is uh Courtney
 
04:19:39.439 --> 04:19:48.710 align:start position:0%
you last witness I have is uh Courtney
Reid

04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.229 --> 04:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reid with the ACLU of New
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh I am speaking in
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
opposition to this amendment uh mostly
 
04:20:00.830 --> 04:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
for reasons that we've heard from other
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
speakers uh I just want
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
to uh restate that in 2016 when
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
considering the balance of data for
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
public health use uh and privacy rights
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
this body did decisively vote down a
 
04:20:17.790 --> 04:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
very similar Bill and has voted down a
 
04:20:21.389 --> 04:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
very similar Bill numerous times uh and
 
04:20:21.399 --> 04:20:22.189 align:start position:0%
very similar Bill numerous times uh and
with

04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:20:24.269 --> 04:20:24.279 align:start position:0%
that uh the Senate right now is
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
considering a similar
 
04:20:29.070 --> 04:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
Bill to collect data that uh as we've
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
heard is a work in progress uh we
 
04:20:33.109 --> 04:20:33.119 align:start position:0%
provided testimony on that bill with
 
04:20:36.189 --> 04:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
several of the the concerns that we have
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh however we feel uh in agreement with
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
the speakers today that that is a better
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle that will
 
04:20:44.830 --> 04:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh better address some of the privacy
 
04:20:47.149 --> 04:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
concerns laid out in the amendment
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
before us uh I could outline a few of
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
those um you've heard some of these
 
04:20:54.910 --> 04:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
concerns from other speakers uh for
 
04:20:57.790 --> 04:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
example we have a couple of of concerns
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
about the individualized data uh being
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
collected um for one uh the lack of
 
04:21:08.349 --> 04:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
funding to safeguard this data being
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
protected is certainly at the top of
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
mind uh wanting to ensure that there is
 
04:21:15.389 --> 04:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
a system in place to make sure that
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
there are are limited risks to data
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
breaches um in addition to that uh we we
 
04:21:24.670 --> 04:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
do support the uh changes to collect
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
aggregate data and I would advise
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
members of this committee or those who
 
04:21:30.030 --> 04:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
are interested in making adjustments to
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill uh as it goes through
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative process to also consider
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
models from Massachusetts and Vermont
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
which uh prompt aggregate data or uh
 
04:21:43.870 --> 04:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
data about the um the abortion itself
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
rather than data about the
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
patient uh another concern we heard from
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
dhj during the Senate Bill hearing was
 
04:21:54.429 --> 04:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
that uh they would like to have some
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
sort of rul making Authority uh we
 
04:21:58.830 --> 04:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
talked about considerations of privacy
 
04:22:00.910 --> 04:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
in rural areas and what data might be
 
04:22:02.710 --> 04:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
public facing I think giving the
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
department that discretion um would help
 
04:22:08.309 --> 04:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh dissuade some of these privacy
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
concerns uh also want to underscore the
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
concern about having the uh Department
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
of Vital Statistics be the collector of
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
data on the front end uh that not being
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
a hipa protected uh
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
entity um I could go into a couple other
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
considerations with this bill but I want
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
to protect your time um I do want to
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
note that this bill does have a 91a
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
exemption that is not in the Senate bill
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we would be
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing um should the two
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
bodies want to continue to collaborate
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
to uh make the best of this bill go
 
04:22:43.319 --> 04:22:46.469 align:start position:0%
to uh make the best of this bill go
forward

04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:48.510 --> 04:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll just I'll stop there and I'm
 
04:22:49.950 --> 04:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
open to taking questions thank you so
 
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions of this
 
04:22:53.550 --> 04:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
04:22:55.710 --> 04:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you and thanks for typing my
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
question um so on the
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
91a are you saying you want it in the
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill or you don't want it in the bill
 
04:23:05.149 --> 04:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to make assumptions
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
the 91a exemption thank you for your
 
04:23:09.550 --> 04:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
question the 91a exemption is something
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we would be open to having
 
04:23:13.630 --> 04:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
conversations about um including in the
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any other
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
you that's the last speaker I have is
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wants to speak on
 
04:23:24.199 --> 04:23:24.910 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wants to speak on
this

04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
amendment seeing none I'm going to close
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Amendment 2025
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
so here's what I'd like to do I'm I'd
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
like us to take a recess for about 15
 
04:23:54.429 --> 04:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
minutes or so and then um uh I'll deal
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
with the issue of the executive session
 
04:24:00.550 --> 04:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
both on this bill and um what I what I
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
would like to uh specifically want to
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
talk to the ranking member about is
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
whether it is possible that we may we
 
04:24:10.349 --> 04:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
may be able to exact some or perhaps
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
even all but at least some of the bills
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
that we now have scheduled to exec on
 
04:24:18.189 --> 04:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
January 30th I think that there are my
 
04:24:20.590 --> 04:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
my impression is that there are some
 
04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
that we would be very much in agreement
 
04:24:25.109 --> 04:24:25.119 align:start position:0%
on um and I but I'd like to talk to her
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
about that so why don't we recess and
 
04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.319 --> 04:25:11.309 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.319 --> 04:25:41.229 align:start position:0%

04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to call uh the Judiciary
 
04:50:58.990 --> 04:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
Committee back uh to order um and I'm
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to um open the executive session
 
04:51:09.070 --> 04:51:09.080 align:start position:0%
on uh House Bill 476 and the non-gain
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and um I'm happy to hear if
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
somebody if anybody objects but my very
 
04:51:17.510 --> 04:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
strong inclination will be that I will
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh immediately recess the executive uh
 
04:51:23.628 --> 04:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
session Mr chair yes does this come as a
 
04:51:28.910 --> 04:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
surprise to you I strongly object to
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
that and let me tell you
 
04:51:32.638 --> 04:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
that and let me tell you
why

04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:51:34.160 --> 04:51:36.350 align:start position:0%
why
you

04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled the
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and we were
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
told that we were going to have a
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on the underlying Bill and then
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
we were going to
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
exec the underlying bill that was not
 
04:51:58.270 --> 04:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
quite two weeks ago last I think Tuesday
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
or maybe it was Wednesday morning the
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
decision was that there would now be a
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
non gerain
 
04:52:10.750 --> 04:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment added to the bill and that we
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
would hear it immediately after we
 
04:52:18.030 --> 04:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
finished at 11:00 the um hearing on uh
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
the underline bill and we would then
 
04:52:25.150 --> 04:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
um have a hearing on the on the
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
amendment and we would then
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
exec and that was in the calendar and
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
that is what was what everybody expected
 
04:52:38.548 --> 04:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
what everybody
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
understood then in the f of time people
 
04:52:45.788 --> 04:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
were told although not all of us were
 
04:52:50.190 --> 04:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
told that the bill was going to
 
04:52:54.390 --> 04:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
be uh at the request that that the prime
 
04:52:56.830 --> 04:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
and the mini
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
primes were um going to um ask that the
 
04:53:03.670 --> 04:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
bill be
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
withdrawn however that
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
bill was assigned to this committee
 
04:53:13.948 --> 04:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
it was put on the
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
schedule for today it is in the hands of
 
04:53:18.160 --> 04:53:20.110 align:start position:0%
schedule for today it is in the hands of
the

04:53:20.110 --> 04:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
committee and therefore I believe it is
 
04:53:27.510 --> 04:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
the committee's decision and um it's all
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
well and good um for somebody to change
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
their mind and I don't have any problem
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
with our clerk wanting to change her
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
mind for whatever reason and I don't
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
even a ask why
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
except that
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
um meanwhile it's the bill is in our
 
04:53:50.110 --> 04:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
possession and I think we ought to vote
 
04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
on the motion ought to be otpa or
 
04:53:57.788 --> 04:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
itl uh whatever and if it's
 
04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
otpa then the first thing is we vote on
 
04:54:03.868 --> 04:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment maybe the amendment will
 
04:54:07.670 --> 04:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
pass maybe it won't um I don't prejudge
 
04:54:10.910 --> 04:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
that and but I care about process and
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
then we would go to the bill now if the
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
first motion is itl then there is no no
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
and that passes then the amendment just
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
disappears because there's no underlying
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
bill I do not I cannot
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
believe that with all the attention
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
given to this that the speaker really
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
wants this bill to come to the floor of
 
04:54:37.510 --> 04:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
the house or that the governor really
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
wants the bill to come to the floor of
 
04:54:43.030 --> 04:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
the house and there are few enough times
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
Well when I can say that I'm surely
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to support the governor I support
 
04:54:50.830 --> 04:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
the speaker more than that but
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
um I I think we ought to do what's our
 
04:54:58.270 --> 04:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
job to do and that's vote on the
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that's okay no go
 
04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
on so if we vote on the bill what
 
04:55:07.628 --> 04:55:07.638 align:start position:0%
happens to the
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
withdrawal it's mooded
 
04:55:12.430 --> 04:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
all I beg to
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
differ Mr chairman um I would have two
 
04:55:18.270 --> 04:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
questions if I may of of you and
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
potentially the ranking member first of
 
04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
all am I right in understanding that
 
04:55:26.830 --> 04:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
house rule 39e is crystal clear that
 
04:55:29.670 --> 04:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
once a request to withdraw has been
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
filed uh that the committee in
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
possession of the bill is not obligated
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation on a bill with
 
04:55:39.070 --> 04:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
that pending withdrawal request it's not
 
04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
obligated right
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
and second of all am I right in
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
interpreting that rule that even if we
 
04:55:49.788 --> 04:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
were without obligation to make such a
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation the withdrawal request
 
04:55:53.708 --> 04:55:53.718 align:start position:0%
would still be pending before the house
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that does it and it I beg
 
04:55:58.830 --> 04:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
to differ it it it says that the
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawal request which is
 
04:56:04.110 --> 04:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
pending there's nothing in there that
 
04:56:06.030 --> 04:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
says that the nature of that pending
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
request is modified by our making a
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the bill
 
04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
anyone I'm happy to hear from anyone
 
04:56:16.708 --> 04:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
else may want to does that does it
 
04:56:18.830 --> 04:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
mention in there about have after the
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
hearing has already opened in regards to
 
04:56:24.390 --> 04:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
for when the withdrawal is made before
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
after the said hearing for that bill
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
well I would think that the chairman
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
would be better positioned to respond
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that what I read here
 
04:56:36.510 --> 04:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
in in plain language is first of all
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we are also not obligated to have
 
04:56:40.350 --> 04:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
held the public hearing although we
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
chose to but to your question if I
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the request to
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
withdrawal was filed before we held the
 
04:56:53.310 --> 04:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
hearing I you know I guess I you know I
 
04:56:54.830 --> 04:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
guess what I I guess what I would say is
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
this I I all of these all of these sort
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
of issues are interesting kind of issues
 
04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
but I think what is beyond dispute is
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
that it is my call as to whether or not
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
are to recess the uh uh to recess the
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
executive session so um I'm happy to
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative Smith has made her
 
04:57:19.150 --> 04:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
position uh clear as to why we should
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
not recess the exe I should not recess
 
04:57:23.230 --> 04:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
the executive session if anybody else
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
wants to address that I'm happy to
 
04:57:24.718 --> 04:57:25.830 align:start position:0%
wants to address that I'm happy to
listen

04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
listen
 
04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
to thank you Mr chair I just have a
 
04:57:31.230 --> 04:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
question of you um because I don't know
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
if you recess the exact do you have to
 
04:57:41.230 --> 04:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
um recess it to a specific date yes
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
I do have to do that and do you have in
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
mind what date that would be yes I do I
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
would I would I would recess it to
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
February 19th which would be well after
 
04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will go to the floor and I
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
guess I would say you know in in
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
response to uh um representative Smith's
 
04:58:02.670 --> 04:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
point I it seems to me that it is I
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but it seems to me very
 
04:58:11.070 --> 04:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
likely that the house will vote um uh to
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
accept the withdrawal of this bill I
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but I don't think I am um
 
04:58:21.390 --> 04:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
but if in some you know really unusual
 
04:58:23.548 --> 04:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
Circumstance the house did not vote to
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
do that it would seem to me that
 
04:58:30.510 --> 04:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
knowing having the result of that vote
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
not to do that would be something that
 
04:58:34.990 --> 04:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be important for this Committee in
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
deciding what we would do with the bill
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
if it came back to us and I you know
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
that will give us
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
I I would think if it would give us a
 
04:58:44.910 --> 04:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea of where what the house
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
was thinking which would be I think
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
helpful to us in deciding what to do so
 
04:58:54.190 --> 04:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh I would point it out M I'm sorry no
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
go ahead I I would point out that if I
 
04:58:59.548 --> 04:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
am correct you will not be here on the
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
19th I will not be here on the 19th okay
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
so um yes representative Manos thank you
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you Mr
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
so um if you recess the exact to
 
04:59:18.670 --> 04:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
February 19th and the house acts on the
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh withdrawal prior to that what happens
 
04:59:24.190 --> 04:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
to the amendment your propos does it
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
does the amendment if if the house votes
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
to withdraw to accept the withdrawal
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
then both the bill and the amendment
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
die um anyone else yes representative
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
tur yeah just process-wise um am I
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
correct that just as you opened and then
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
and then am s are suggesting that we uh
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
postpone the rest of the exec session
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
could we not have done that this morning
 
04:59:51.150 --> 04:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
with the hearing overall it was
 
04:59:53.948 --> 04:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
announced we opened it we could have if
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it correctly decided to
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
adjourn that hearing until a later date
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
when this was all known it feels as and
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
the reason I asked this is it feels as
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
though the decision that was made to
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
hold the hearing today puts us in the
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
position of now having done all of the
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
work on on these bills and I would like
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
to finish that process and not basically
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
have our all of all that effort
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
essentially dismissed by a vote of the
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
house on you know the underlying
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
withdrawal okay I'm
 
05:00:31.868 --> 05:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
thinking giving the people the ability
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
to speak whether it's moot or not is is
 
05:00:36.750 --> 05:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
is important so whether or not we
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
execute today or we execute at all or it
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
gets withdrawn allowing the the public
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
to speak on the bill and have a voice is
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
more important than our our time
 
05:00:51.628 --> 05:00:51.638 align:start position:0%
frames just as a f I agree it was a good
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
decision I would just like to finish the
 
05:00:55.310 --> 05:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
process I hear you all right anybody
 
05:00:57.310 --> 05:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
else have anything they want to say on
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
on the yes representative sh picking up
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
on what representative tur said you know
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
I think it was a good decision to have
 
05:01:08.110 --> 05:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
the hearings uh and let everyone speak
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
but um and that was our responsibility
 
05:01:12.750 --> 05:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
in many ways to do that but I think it's
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
equally our responsibility to uh express
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
our opinions at this point rather than
 
05:01:23.910 --> 05:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh abdicate uh to a a more Arcane
 
05:01:26.548 --> 05:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
process all right anyone else wish to be
 
05:01:26.558 --> 05:01:28.190 align:start position:0%
process all right anyone else wish to be
heard

05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm just going to make one more
 
05:01:33.150 --> 05:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
point and then I I'll you know I I would
 
05:01:37.990 --> 05:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
like to think that I could be persuasive
 
05:01:40.548 --> 05:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
and or that you could be pers persuaded
 
05:01:45.948 --> 05:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know which is and I imagine that
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's lots that I don't know about
 
05:01:52.390 --> 05:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on but I believe very
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
strongly that the work of the
 
05:01:58.110 --> 05:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
legislature is done in committee it is
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
not done on the floor of the house the
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
floor of the house is where we um can
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
possibly make slight changes or Rectify
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
a mistake of a committee but it is the
 
05:02:10.680 --> 05:02:11.830 align:start position:0%
a mistake of a committee but it is the
committee's

05:02:11.830 --> 05:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
05:02:14.708 --> 05:02:14.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have been here now for
 
05:02:14.718 --> 05:02:15.590 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have been here now for
five

05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
hours um and we have people were
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
attentive people were
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
respectful um uh the audience was the
 
05:02:31.948 --> 05:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
best um
 
05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
behaved I that I can remember in many
 
05:02:39.070 --> 05:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
many years on on the on this subject
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
matter and I think that the it is
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
respectful of the process that the
 
05:02:48.990 --> 05:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee carry out its
 
05:02:53.910 --> 05:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um and um I I grant you
 
05:02:56.830 --> 05:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
that you are the chair I grant you that
 
05:02:59.548 --> 05:02:59.558 align:start position:0%
you have the authority I don't question
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
that and you know that I
 
05:03:05.788 --> 05:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
respect you as an individual and because
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
of your position but I think that the
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
committee should be respected to two and
 
05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
that we ought to be able to vote on this
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
now um I have no idea how the vote will
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
will turn out and it might be that you
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
know that people will hang me up to dry
 
05:03:26.350 --> 05:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
or or if I were one of our colleagues
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know nail me to a tree um but um
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
that's a bad joke I'm sorry uh and and
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you know the the outcome wouldn't
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
be what I might have predicted but I
 
05:03:40.948 --> 05:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
think we ought to know how this
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee feels about the underlying
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and and the non-gain amendment and
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
you make your decision and you have
 
05:03:53.750 --> 05:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
years of experience of having to make
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
judicious decisions and I recognize that
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
but I want to be clear that I think it's
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the Judiciary
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
Committee to handle this matter and I
 
05:04:06.958 --> 05:04:08.230 align:start position:0%
Committee to handle this matter and I
will

05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
be uh obviously I'm not going you know
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
what what we would do on the floor I'm
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
not going
 
05:04:16.080 --> 05:04:19.350 align:start position:0%
not going
to

05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:22.948 --> 05:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
oppose the the right of the of the Prime
 
05:04:26.750 --> 05:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor to withdraw but this bill was
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
put in knowing full well that that it
 
05:04:31.868 --> 05:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
was never going to go ahead that the
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
governor was not going to support it
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the speaker was not going to
 
05:04:38.230 --> 05:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
support it it was put in to make a point
 
05:04:40.110 --> 05:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
and the point was made that there are
 
05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
people who think that the bill has
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
credit and I understand that there was
 
05:04:47.470 --> 05:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
never an expectation that it was going
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
to pass now I think it's important that
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee can carry out
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
its obligations thank you and I'm
 
05:05:02.670 --> 05:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
Perez can we vote to accept the
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
withdrawal as being our vote would that
 
05:05:10.590 --> 05:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
no okay we cannot
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard all right
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much I
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate the input I've received from
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
everybody I'm uh my decision is that I
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
am going to recess the hearing uh the
 
05:05:23.430 --> 05:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
executive session on this matter to
 
05:05:23.440 --> 05:05:24.510 align:start position:0%
executive session on this matter to
February

05:05:24.510 --> 05:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
February
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
19th uh at 10:00 a.m. um and as as
 
05:05:30.750 --> 05:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith pointed out I will
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
not be here but I I'm sure I leave it in
 
05:05:35.470 --> 05:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
the very capable hands of Vice chairman
 
05:05:38.750 --> 05:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
Manion I expect I fully expect that
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
there will be nothing to exec because
 
05:05:43.070 --> 05:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
there will be nothing left of this bill
 
05:05:44.868 --> 05:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
by that time it'll it'll having gone to
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
the floor and having and the withdrawal
 
05:05:49.750 --> 05:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
having been accepted by the house um
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
with that I think we're U adjourned and
 
05:05:54.270 --> 05:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
I will see remember
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because we couldn't do we
 
05:05:59.910 --> 05:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't exact a number of bills that I
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
think we would have all we would have
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
had agreement on and at least cut down
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%

05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
time she's introduced a bill she was
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
very excited about testifying she seems
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
like a very nice person and I said fine
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to switch the time uh so that
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
her bill will be heard on the 12th and
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm moving a bill up from the 12th to
 
05:07:35.910 --> 05:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
the 5th and for the 19th repes
 
05:07:38.830 --> 05:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative Manion pointed out that I
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
I had scheduled for the last hearing of
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
the day on that day one of the the bill
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
transgender Sports and bathroom the bill
 
05:07:56.190 --> 05:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
it was last year 396 from last year he
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
points out correctly that that could end
 
05:08:01.948 --> 05:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
up taking some time so I'll move that up
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
I'll move that up earlier in the day um
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
and uh uh and that's going to be the
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
change so I'm incorporate this change
 
05:08:10.798 --> 05:08:12.270 align:start position:0%
change so I'm incorporate this change
into

05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
into
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh yes that's where we had
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
it last time 396 we had it in here last
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
time and there you know it's it's
 
05:08:24.670 --> 05:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
crowded but not
 
05:08:27.390 --> 05:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh maybe
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:36.070 --> 05:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
else but uh well for you don't I mean if
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%

05:08:50.070 --> 05:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
