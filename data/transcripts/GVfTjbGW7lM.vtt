House Bill 187 relative to the emergency
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
powers of the Commissioner of Health and
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
Human Services as you all know this bill
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
passed HHS in elderly Affairs 19-2 and
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.909 align:start position:0%
the house
333

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
333
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
to6 uh this bill does not address the
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency orders other bills
 
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
do that this bill addresses emergency
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
orders from the commissioner of DHHS of
 
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
which there were two on April 3rd the
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner issued an emergency order
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
regarding the prescribing and
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
distribution of chloroquin to treat
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
covid-19 on September 1 she rescinded
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
that emergency order the bill also deals
 
00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
with various powers under the public
 
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
health and infectious disease laws let
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
me go through the bill and hit the
 
00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.029 align:start position:0%
me go through the bill and hit the
highlights

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
page one lines 13 to 14 we strike in any
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
other law to the contrary the role
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
doctors and nurses played in the
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
Holocaust is troubling to me and I'm
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
troubled that emergency orders could in
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire supersede certain criminal
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
laws not that I believe our commissioner
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
would ever be involved in
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
such page one line 17 to 23 you can see
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
current law which I believe was
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
appropriately used to limit the
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
distribution of hydroxy chloroquin under
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
the emergency order
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
but I am not convinced the legislature
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
intended to give the power to the
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner to prevent the prescribing
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
of a drug medical professionals had
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
reason to believe might be effective
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
changing restrict to prioritize and
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
adding lines 24 to 25 clarify that we
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
are not granting that
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
power during Bill drafting the need for
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
input into the vaccine distribution plan
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
became evident reviewing the statute I
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
saw that we had an existing Ethics
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
Committee so I called John Williams and
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
asked who was on it he told me there
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
were no current appointees but the
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
governor subsequently reconstituted it
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
be ready for the next pandemic this is
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
referenced in lines 26 to 29 and we will
 
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
discuss that further in section two of
 
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.510 align:start position:0%
discuss that further in section two of
the

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
bill page two lines 16 to 17 we're
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
changing none of the language of the
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
existing statute but changing the
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
reference the language of the current
 
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
statute clearly states that an
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%

individuals the right to refuse

treatment and remain in quarantine and I
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
believe that was what was intended the

second reference is the grounds for

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
page two line 29 and on this new
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
language one of our objectives is to
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
make sure emergency orders are subject
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
to legislative oversight HHS oversight
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
already exists so we do not need to
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
create a committee for this Purpose with
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
the current membership of five a
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote would be four out of
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
five members a very high
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
threshold HHS Nal Affairs felt this was
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
sufficiently high to prevent this
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
Authority from being
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
misused section two of the bill is a
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the Ethics Committee
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
established for H1N1 to accomplish five
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
things one the committee should actually
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
have appointees and exist when it is
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
needed by appointing legislators to the
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee we can make sure that will
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
happen two the committee should review
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
investigations orders and treatments
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
ordered to make sure they're done
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately and fairly this will be
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
done with Aggregate and deidentified
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
data three last year's HHS nly Affairs
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee was contacted by an individual
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
representing a disabled individual who
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
felt their rights were violated as a
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
mask order prevented them from getting
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
needed Medical Care they couldn't go to
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
the doctor to get a note to say they
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
didn't eat a mask to see the doctor we
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
discussed having a commission to address
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
such concerns but the existing Ethics
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
Committee already in statute seemed a
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
more logical
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
place four the governor used the state
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
disaster medical advisory committee to
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
reconstitute this committee to create
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
the vaccine distribution plan when the
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
plan was created there was no data to
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
suggest the current vaccines prevented
 
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
the spread of disease if there were it
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
would have been debatable whether the
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine should first be deployed to
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
protect the most vulnerable in society
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
or to interrupt the vectors that spread
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
disease five DHHS felt that police and
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
fire members of a prior incarnation of
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
that committee did not bring a lot to
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
the table and therefore they asked us to
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
remove them however the professional
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters want to be put back on the
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
ethics advisory oversight committee and
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
I am quite amend amendable to that
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment section three addresses the
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
membership changes to HHS oversight in
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
last year's hb1 1245 one of the Omnibus
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
bills on page
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
nine we do not believe that those
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
changes were intended to remove minority
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
party input from HHS oversight and this
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
section undos the UND do those
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
changes thank you and with that I'm
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions I just
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
have do we do we have his written
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
testimony yes I sent it to you all by
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
email to make life easier for the clerk
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I paraphrased a few sections
 
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
but it's close
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
enough thank you representative Marsh
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
the certainly makes your testimony more
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
effective are there any other questions
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
from the committee uh representative
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
SMI thank you madam chair uh good
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
morning representative Marsh good to see
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
you um um the first question I have is
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um the
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
appropriateness and the authority with
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
regard to the two-thirds vote um to
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
override uh
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners um decisions
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
um as you probably know uh it's a
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
general rule of the legislature that no
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
committee has plary Authority um that um
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
that the legislature must uh weigh in on
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um decisions uh recommendations off
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
offered by the all the Committees of the
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
of the legislature um I I I see you've
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
established a fairly High bar four out
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
of five
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
um I I'm still not completely
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea that we're
 
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
suddenly giving this committee um that
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
kind of authority can you speak to that
 
00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:16.839 align:start position:0%
first Peter I think that you've been in
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
the house a lot longer than I have and
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
if you wish to change that to uh calling
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
a house session such the house will vote
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
on whether to uh resend the order I
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
would be perfectly amenable to that uh
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh but but I think some mechanism needs
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
to be in place such that there is
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
accountability right well I I I do agree
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
with you that that it's a Sticky
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
Wicket getting the legislature into this
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
kind of an emergency situation anyway
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
and that's my going to be my followup if
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
the chair will permit
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
um I think we representative schm I
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
think we've heard your question and the
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor has agreed with you that
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done in this
 
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.990 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done in this
willing

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
accept well I I'm very comfortable with
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
that because I I've de dealt with
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh on a number of
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
issues over the years I have a lot of
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
confidence in his integrity and his
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
abilities uh and I do think that the
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to be involved more
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
than it is under the current statutes
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to emergencies I think some
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the proposed solutions that we've
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
seen in other bills uh go too far and
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
become effectively unworkable um
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
if you get the legislature into a
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
situation requiring immediate action or
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
effectively immediate action so uh we'll
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
we'll have a look at that representative
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
Marsh uh and I certainly do appreciate
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%

like representative Max Abramson who

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
not going to repeat anything that the
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor already said uh I do support the
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh I'm representative Max Abramson
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
representing Hampton Hampton Falls and
 
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.110 align:start position:0%
representing Hampton Hampton Falls and
seab

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
seab
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
Brook um I do support the bill um but I
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
also uh agree with a comment earlier by
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt um I did not want
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
to have um if the governor or the
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner of DHHS calls an emergency
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
or uh declares an order I believe they
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
need to do that immediately when there's
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
an iMed emergency um I would rather they
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
overreact until there's time for things
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
to kind of settle down we certainly had
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency uh back in March of
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
last year um but it's difficult
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
especially when you have a legislature
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
of 400 members of the house and 24
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate it's difficult for
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
all of us to meet and especially under
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
conditions like this um where just the
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
active meeting um creates the risk of
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
spreading uh a virus or or another type
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
of illness we don't we don't know what's
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future um so my
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh my preference is to Simply have have
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
a provision where the commissioner of
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
DHHS can act and the governor can act
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
but have a a different mechanism in
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
place um where for example 100 members
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
of the house or 100 members of the
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
legislature are able to raise an
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
objection to a particular order and that
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
the um where we don't actually have to
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
meet in order to raise that objection
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
either by having the house clerk contact
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
each each member by email and uh respond
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
so if a particular uh emergency order is
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
a little too restrictive or Draconian or
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
in some cases if members feel that
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
they're counterproductive uh 100 members
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
would also be a pretty high bar and I'm
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
willing to to um draft that Amendment um
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
I also I I do understand that getting
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
four out of five on this particular
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
committee is is also High bar but that
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
that committee would actually have to
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
meet also um probably by Zoom session um
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
be um it it's very difficult to get um
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
how do you put this it's hard to
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
negotiate um from the vantage point of a
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee when you're negotiating it's
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
always one person versus another um and
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
when we have uh uh uh the executive
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
branches trying to be a bit too
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
restrictive our job is to serve as a a
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
check on the uh the power of the other
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
branches of government uh especially the
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch and I think that a
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism more like um Simply Having say
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
a 100 members raise an objection to a
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
particular restriction or uh an edict
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
coming down um and then having the
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of of
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services contact
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
individual members find out what their
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
concern is and then uh respond to that
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
and rewrite the order uh and as usual
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to do the footwork on that I
 
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
do support the rest of this bill I think
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
I I voted for it on the floor and I I
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
agree with the uh with uh the intent of
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative abson are
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
there any questions for him
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you mam
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
Abramson for taking my
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.830 align:start position:0%
Abramson for taking my
question

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
specifically is is a an act by the
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
Services that as we've just been alluded
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
to by the prime sponsor here is um is
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
something that was done just
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
once with the actions of the
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
Services are generally done because it
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
involves a technical
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
expertise that is above and beyond what
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
you would normally find specifically in
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
the executive Branch so representative
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
Abramson the the fact that this is this
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
is a legis according at least on page
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
two the the bottom part this is a joint
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee that is that is made up of
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
people from Health and Human Services
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
that it would be fair to presume have
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
that level of
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
expertise do you
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
see do you not see this as as an
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate Avenue whereas the whole
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
house would conceivably lack that level
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
of expertise to to make a decision in
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
that in the manner in which you're
 
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.789 align:start position:0%
that in the manner in which you're
you're

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
advocating of of having a certain number
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
of members raising an
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
objection specifically just the fact
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
that you know the the purpose of the
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on Health
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is to provide
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
oversight but with the technical
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
background necessary to make that
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate um I understand where you're
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
coming from the particular type of
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
objection um that I would I would see
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
our role as raising is less about having
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
expertise about a particular subject
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
than um certain
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
obvious um instances I hate to bring up
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
U examples because some of them sound a
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
little bit silly I was contacted by my
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
local American Legion um and they said
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to open but they can't
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
do shuffle board and I said what you
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
know are you sure about that and they
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
said yeah they they've been contacted
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
would you do would you do something
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
about that and I'm not able to contact
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's office over letting the
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
American Legion open shuffle board
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
because I have a a liazon i I contact
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
who hasn't gotten back with
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
me if you if you would notice this bill
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
is about the orders of the
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
DHHS commissioner it is not about the
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
governor's orders we have other bills
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with on that these are
 
00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
specifically HHS
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
orders and as was mentioned there was
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
exactly one a technical one restricting
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
the use of a medicine that was believed
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
to be in short
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
supply the the orders you're talking
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
about were the governor's executive
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
orders and they're not the subject of
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm I'm aware of that but there
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
there have been so many different um
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions and orders that have come
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
down when you have um when you have a
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
particular case um where one of your
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
constituents raises an objection and
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's raises an issue where it's
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
something is going to cause a health
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
problem or a hardship or is going to
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
cause a problem for that specific case
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
um whether it's because they're a
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
American Indian and their immune system
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
responds differently or they've had
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
prior medical problems um and they bring
 
00:23:06.669 --> 00:23:06.679 align:start position:0%
it up with you and it's it's obvious
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
with just a constituent talking to you I
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's any particular
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
need for expertise when their doctors
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
has told them that there's a problem
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
with a particular order that that that's
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
the point where you as a member should
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
should raise an objection and whether
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
they've hit some mark 100 or not that
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the commission of DHHS should be
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
responding to that not not not pushing
 
00:23:29.549 --> 00:23:29.559 align:start position:0%
down and then enforcing them where it's
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
going to create either an economic
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
hardship or it's going to create uh uh a
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
shortage somewhere in the marketplace or
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to create an issue um because
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
we can't meet in the middle of uh an
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
emergency and introduce a bill and have
 
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.710 align:start position:0%
emergency and introduce a bill and have
that

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill take effect the executive branch
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
has to be able to respond to emergencies
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
and at the same time if they're over
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
responding or they're doing something
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's causing a problem with any one of
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
our constituents any of us needs to be
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
to serve as the messenger and say this
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
is an obvious case where a particular
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
restriction or requirement or rule that
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
you put in place is causing a hardship
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
for an individual or or potentially
 
00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.549 align:start position:0%
for an individual or or potentially
health

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
problems thank
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair uh so
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
representative aberson uh I I very much
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the general uh seriousness
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
and uh um and rationality of your
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
general remarks uh because I I think
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
that it's clear that in a medical
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
emergency uh you have to have a rapid
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
response capability uh so the the the
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
question of what kind of an oversight
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
board or committee can be set up uh
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't like the idea of 100
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
legislators because you're talking about
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
people who potentially have no expertise
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever being involved they might not
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
make up the majority uh but I think that
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
that the makeup of any oversight
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee that can review a
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
policy um is is something that we have
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
to entertain very seriously uh I I I I
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
am wondering whether uh you you'd care
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
to think further on this issue because
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I I think that it's clear that
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
there are some aspects the chair has
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
already talked about going a field uh
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
with regard to things not involving the
 
00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:32.430 align:start position:0%
with regard to things not involving the
HHS

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh and that's appropriate
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
but if I may just IND if she'll indulge
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
me just a little bit we we had the
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
situation where the governor disregarded
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
the the recommendations of the joint
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee uh he had established
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
this goer uh entity which was completely
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
subject to his authority and and you
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
recall that he was sued by the
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
legislature by the fiscal committee and
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
the courts really did not want to get
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
into that if at all possible that's the
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
kind of thing we want to
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
avoid thank you representative Schmidt
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
but I would hope you would keep your
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
comments to the bill in question you can
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
be more broad ranging an executive
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
session but this is a hearing are there
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
any other people that wish members of
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
the committee that have questions for
 
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.590 align:start position:0%
the committee that have questions for
representative

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.710 align:start position:0%
 
Abramson

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.029 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair I I just
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
would like to get um representative
 
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.710 align:start position:0%
would like to get um representative
Abrams

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
Abrams
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
perspective so he can help me understand
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
the committee because the committee the
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that amends who's in
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
that committee and and what they you
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
know need to look into is more broad
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
than just emergency situations it adds
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
that but the the committee um has been
 
00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
in existence for quite a while and I'm
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering if
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's really opening
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
up the door
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
for the um situation that he started to
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
explain about just constituents having
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
issues with all sorts of things and that
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
this committee will need
 
00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
to address a lot of things other than
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
just executive order related things just
 
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.389 align:start position:0%
just executive order related things just
policies

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
that they don't um like that may impact
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
like people with disabilities for
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
example and those could those could be
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
executive orders doesn't have to be
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
executive order by the Health and Human
 
00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:53.029 align:start position:0%
executive order by the Health and Human
Service

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
Service
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
um person um
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I'm just wondering what
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
what might be the implications of that
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
broadening the scope of that committee
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
and putting a lot more people on it
 
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.269 align:start position:0%
and putting a lot more people on it
thank

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
you would you be able to answer this
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
question I think it's more in your scope
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
since you wrote the
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
Bill uh yes I'm still here and I'd be
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
glad to answer the question I don't
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
think we actually are broadening the
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
scope of Health and Human Services
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
oversight because we're really uh just
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
returning the house membership back to
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
what it was prior to the bill that was
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
signed into law this last summer uh for
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
instance I'm currently Vice chair of HHS
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
nly Affairs and the vice chair of HHS
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
nly Affairs has typically been on that
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
committee but I am not because there
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
aren't enough spots um and in general
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
the people who are appointed to HHS
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
oversight do have some expertise in
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
health care so if you're going to pick a
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
group out of the legislature uh to have
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
oversight over the the uh uh
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
major orders uh like the hydroxy
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
chloroquin order it's a good group to
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
pick for that the area where you really
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
need expertise are the various orders
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
that come out of the the uh infectious
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
disease laws and those are referred to
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the the second committee the uh
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh currently known as the E Ethics
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
Committee but we're renaming it the
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
ethics oversight committee um and those
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
people have pretty much been picked for
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
technical expertise and and are
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for looking at those sorts
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:33.509 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:33.519 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
hor I'm know whether this question is
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
more appropriately directed rent AB than
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
rent Marsh but um doesn't HHS in
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
addition to the emergency order on April
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
3rd about the medication they you know
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
issue lots of they make lots of policies
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
for all the different entities they deal
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
with remember we had a specific issue
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
with h nursing homes because my mother's
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
in well she's an assisted living
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
facility which is kind of an here sorry
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
could you speak more clearly I can't
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
understand a word you're saying oh sorry
 
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
yes um and I'm not even in the room okay
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
so I would we mentioned um an emergency
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
order that the commissioner um issued
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
but also the commissioner the uh
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner also issues all kinds of
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
other uh all kinds of other
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
Communications to various uh various
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
entities and um How would how would it
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
affect their ability to issue and U you
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
know carry out those I been WR a
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
specific issue my family my mother's in
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
a assisted living facility which
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
basically a nursing home and they had to
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh sent out a memo about nursing home um
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
at people moving in during covid which
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
was a misunderstooding and of course I'm
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
a State Rep so I probably more access to
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner office I did but I
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
actually called them up and you know a
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
few minutes later got a call from a got
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
a call from one of the Commissioners
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
assistants and they actually were were
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
quite responsive to this and that's
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
some so this interfere with the uh
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner's you know existing ability
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
to you know uh deal with pandemic or
 
00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.070 align:start position:0%
to you know uh deal with pandemic or
other

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
crises no I would say just the opposite
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and and through either way either
 
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
using this existing committee or having
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
100 members object or any number of
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
members object um and the reason is that
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
most of the time in my experience when
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
I've contacted do or Department of
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
Safety or another agency doing
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
constituent work um most of the time
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
they're responsive um but other than the
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
budget uh we don't have any mechanism in
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
place to kind of force them to be
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
responsive to the legislature
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
so sorry we don't have a mechanism to
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
force them to so if you had um let's say
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
50 members of the House object or or it
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
Rose to 60 that would be really unusual
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
circumstance um because an agency is not
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
being responsive then U they would
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
realize that that there's the potential
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
for them to be overridden by 100
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
objectors and uh U they would have to
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
take some kind of action they would have
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
to respond to the concerns of at least
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
some of them um and and for example in
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
your case um you happen to note um
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
people in the nursing home and people
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
who work at the nursing home
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
um who are in your District um almost
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state knows at least one
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
member of the house um and we we're very
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have some of the best
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
representation anywhere in the New
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state house and but if
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
somebody has a very specific problem
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's an obvious problem then they need
 
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to to contact their member of
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
the House and if it's if it's you know
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
potentially life-threatening then then
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
members of the House Can Talk Amongst
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
each other as as we we do both in
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
hearings and uh
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know we as we tend to socialize and
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
if enough of us raise an objection to a
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
specific order they should change that
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
order to uh uh accommodate the concern I
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
think it's a it it's much quicker than
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
trying to schedule a
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
meeting um of a committee or task force
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
or the legislature and try and have the
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
action thank you representative broa you
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:34.269 align:start position:0%
had a
question

00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
you're

00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
muted you have to unmute yourself
 
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.389 align:start position:0%
muted you have to unmute yourself
representative

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
for I'm so sorry apologies thank you
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
Madame chair representative Marsh is
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
chrisan is you do the these groups that
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
you're mentioned in your um in your bill
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
already exists right we're not forming
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
anything new we're just
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
putting we may be renaming something but
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
we're really not changing anything
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's being practiced now correct well
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
sort of HHS oversight exists and has
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
existed for a very long time uh the
 
00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:14.599 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee was in statute but no
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
one was appointed to it and that turned
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
out to be a problem when we wanted to
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
ask them to draft the vaccine
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
distribution plan so in fact it is a
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
change in that we are going to actually
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that this committee actually
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
exists rather than just being in statute
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
and having no one appointed to it follow
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
chair Madam chair follow up thank you um
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
so let me rephrase my question so
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
essentially in statute these groups
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
exist whether or not people were
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
appointed to them that's a different
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
issue yes okay thank you that my
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.870 align:start position:0%
question has been answered thank you

questions all right is there anyone else
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
amendment the
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
amendment do that EX

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
five minutes oh okay got however you do
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
you do have a motion on another bill 414
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
I do have a motion on
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
414 I'm gonna make the motion to retain
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
second that's evacuation
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
order yes oh sorry
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion by
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson seconded by
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative leus to retain House Bill
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
414 and represent
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson in uh in a review of of one
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
thing in particular in New Hampshire
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
that would be substantially problematic
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
with 414 is that it it is um it is
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
completely and totally incompatible with
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
the cook emergency U plan that exists
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
not only from a New Hampshire standpoint
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
but for the regional uh plan that is
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
developed and required by the nuclear
 
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.069 align:start position:0%
developed and required by the nuclear
Regulatory

00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
Regulatory
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
Commission so I we're going to have to
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're GNA have to take that into
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
consideration here and figure out if if
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
414 is going to even be possible to jive
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
with with that particular New Hampshire
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%

is this conversation something that
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be able to hear if

Sant naso is likely to lose connectivity

for a while and I was just reassuring
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
him that I'm not expecting to exec
 
00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
anything until after lunch because we
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing to
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
do that's fine it's just if it was
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
intended to be audible I mean to be
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
intelligible to all of us that was not
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
happening and if it wasn't uh that's
 
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.950 align:start position:0%
happening and if it wasn't uh that's
okay

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
too well it wasn't secret but it wasn't
 
00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:35.309 align:start position:0%
too well it wasn't secret but it wasn't
necessarily

about the audio more than anything
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%

533 establishing a division of
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
investigation and compliance in the
 
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.630 align:start position:0%

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
Commission the I'm here as the prime
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor but also here representing the
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
whole of ways and means
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
I filed this bill at the request of
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre the executive director
 
00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.309 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre the executive director
of

00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
Lottery the bill does three major things
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's really four components to the
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill the first thing it does is
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
informally creates a division of
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and compliance within the
 
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.230 align:start position:0%
investigation and compliance within the
Lottery

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
Commission the bill creates a structure
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
only to be staffed by existing staff
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
members they are not asking for new
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
positions or
 
00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:57.790 align:start position:0%
positions or
new

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
titles within the
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill in doing so it clearly outlines the
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
duties of investigation and compliance
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
again much of which is going on
 
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
today the second thing it does it
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
changes the way in which Lottery
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
interacts with the AG's office when it
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
comes to background checks required for
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
licenses in short Lottery require uh lot
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
will do a lot of the B the data
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
Gathering as it works with the AG but
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
the AG's office still has the final say
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
on the fitness of an applicant to
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
license the reason for this is it speeds
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
up licensing since fact finding will be
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
be a priority to the lottery and May at
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
office the third thing it does this bill
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
does is it gives the investigation and
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement division rulemaking
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
Authority and the the only other thing
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
is that it's effect the effective data
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
2022 Ways and Means voted uh we were the
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
significantly with the Advent of Kino

gaming the functions of investigation
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
and compliance have always been
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
extremely important we concluded that an
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
organizational structure that reflects
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
this is is is much
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
needed that is my testimony Madam chair
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
I will take
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
questions I did talk to Charlie McIntyre
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
this morning and he has a conflict and
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
he cannot be
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
here but uh his chief compliance officer
 
00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.109 align:start position:0%
here but uh his chief compliance officer
John

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
John
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
coni is supposedly on the zoom I can't I
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
can't see that from here but if you can
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
let me know if he's on on the zoom I may
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
defer some of the questions to him thank
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
you what was the name John
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
um c c m f o r t he's here we promoted
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
him to panelist does he need to testify
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions so I'm willing to take
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions and uh again I filed this bill
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
on behalf of of Lottery and John may be
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
able to add uh some other reasoning
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
behind the lot's request for this but
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take questions if if there are
 
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.150 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take questions if if there are
any

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:00.349 align:start position:0%
any
representative

00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
fellows I I did not mean to I don't
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
think I raised my hand okay no
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
problem Mr Cony do you have anything
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
that you need to say to us I can just
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
add uh representative abrami um gave a
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
great summary of the bill this is really
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
just a redefinition of the existing
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
structure this is not an addition of um
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
positions or titles
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
um at present um when we investigate new
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
um lenses for gaming uh all of the
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility goes to the Attorney
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
General's office um and so we do not
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
have authority to reach out to law
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement to gather information um and
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
as representative abrami said sometimes
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
um obviously the the Attorney General's
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
office has many uh roles and
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um gaming licensing is
 
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.109 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um gaming licensing is
not

00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
highest on their priority list
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
understandably um and so ultimately this
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
bill allows us to do some of the leg
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
work on behalf of doj um as
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
representative abami said ultimately
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
they would still be responsible for
 
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
making a determination as to whether a
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
potential leny is fit to be involved
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
with gaming in New Hampshire but this
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
gives us some Authority on the front end
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
um at the Lottery Commission U to do
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
some of the background investig
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
package up that information and send it
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office so that
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
we can make a decision together um and
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully expedite that process and also
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
we we obviously have uh sources of uh
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
information and intelligence that aren't
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily available to the attorney
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
jour's office they obviously have those
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
that are not available to us um so this
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
makes it more of a collaborative
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
investigation and oversight of our
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming which we believe is
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
important as representative abami said
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
this is a growing
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh area um and we want to make sure that
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
the people who are coming into this uh
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
gaming are uh are well suited to um to
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
work with Charities and to work with
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
players in the gaming
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
environment thank you uh representative
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair uh good
 
00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:18.799 align:start position:0%
morning Mr Conforti uh I'm curious can

you tell us uh what kind of
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications investigators
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
for uh the Lottery Commission would have
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
as opposed to qualifications of uh
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
employees of the AG's office to do these
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
investigations so thank you for the
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
question representative um we the I I am
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
a former member of the Attorney
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
General's office so I I can speak to I
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
know that doj investigators are
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
generally former law enforcement um at
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission we have um five
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
investigator positions right now two are
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
former law enforcement uh officials um
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
who have come to us um one is a uh
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
former administrative investigator um
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
and two have been with the Lottery
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
Commission for so long I'm not sure what
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
their prior experience is but we do have
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
the head of our uh of our investigations
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
unit is a former law enforcement member
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and certainly future hiring we're
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
trying to stay in that in that
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
vein for question Madam chair follow up
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you also stated um that the
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission has sources of
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
information not available to the AG
 
00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
could you give us a little Enlightenment
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
as to what sources you
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
would sure I'd be happy to and I can use
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
a recent example um we have a lot of
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
information that you receive um comes
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
from other members of the Comm Community
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
um and so obviously we have a
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
relationship with all of our
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
lies um we have a very granular
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's happening in
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
these rooms um we have a relationship uh
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
with certain players in fact um that
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
that frequent these rooms so we had a
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
situation recently um that I I don't
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
want to go into depth in but we we had
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
received some information from other um
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
lenses that there may be areas of
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
concern with a leny um that wouldn't
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
have showed up on a uh criminal
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
background check or a financial record
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
check um and that's that's really what
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to in terms of uh areas of
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
information that we get from being in
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
the in the field in the industry itself
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's office is
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
really doing highlevel criminal and
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
financial background checks um and
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we can put puzzle pieces
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
together based on
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
information that we receive uh from our
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
lenses and from other people in the
 
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.270 align:start position:0%
lenses and from other people in the
gaming

00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
industry thank you very much you
 
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.710 align:start position:0%
industry thank you very much you
representative

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair uh just a
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
couple I think this needs a little word
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
smithing um looking at it I I think some
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that were're put in here
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
um need to be Rewritten if you look on
 
00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.910 align:start position:0%
um need to be Rewritten if you look on
page

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
two uh line six and line seven it says
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission shall report the
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
results of s investigation to the
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General within
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
45 and it strikes days after the receipt
 
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:44.630 align:start position:0%
45 and it strikes days after the receipt
of

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
request good point and also on the same
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
page line 10 and 11 um I think needs to
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
be fixed um it says discretion to
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
determine the extent of which in the
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
manner in which the results may be
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
reported to other state agency that
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound right I think it needs to
 
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.789 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound right I think it needs to
be

00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
rewarded whether it's to the other state
 
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
determined and then one more spot uh
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
lines 12 to
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
13 um it ends with results are to retain
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
their confidential character ends in a
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
period and then on line 13 the Attorney
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
General should be start started with a
 
00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:31.589 align:start position:0%
General should be start started with a
capital

00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
T those are the changes I see that need
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
to be made thank you representative
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
goalie we make sure you get a chance to
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
review any
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
O'Brian uh thank you madam chair and my
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
question uh Mr katti thank you for
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
taking my uh question uh I would imagine
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
if the the Attorney General's office
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
investigated me for such a position uh
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
everything would be uh confidential and
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking forward uh with you I
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
do see red line 12 and 13 of page two
 
00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
but uh would you meet the current
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
standards by the AG's office and onon
 
00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
conventionality of the
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
applicant that thank you representative
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
that would be my my expectation is that
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
that would be an investigation a
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
background investigation that would be
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
confidential whether it's done uh by the
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh Lottery Commission or the Attorney
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
General's office again this is not we we
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
are not taking over the investigation we
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
are just uh supplementing the
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
investigation that exists and I I it's
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
my belief that the confidential uh
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
manner of that would remain the
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
same thank you
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
m um representative broa
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you when I read this
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill originally it sounded to me like it
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
was a result of self a self
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
audit and um I'm wondering would you
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
um is the Liquor Commission going to be
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
um be audited
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
soon just
 
00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
was it was just it was
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
just I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't mean
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
the lottery Comm
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
sorry uh no trouble representative the
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh the lottery is is uh audited by LBA
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
every year um we just uh finished the
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
2000 the fiscal year 2020 audit um I'm
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's completely finalized
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
it should be very close to finalized um
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
I would say that our performance was was
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
very um very good um and actually none
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
of the findings that I believe relate to
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
the area of the commission that we're
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
discussing right now with regard to
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming um but yes uh we we
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
are still we are constantly uh looking
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
at ways to improve because we are as
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative abrami said we are
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
growing there's been additional um uh
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
games uh that have been authorized by
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature um and again we're
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
looking to improve processes uh I know
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
that there's a study commission that has
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
is under consideration by the
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
legislature right now which we um you
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
know we're looking forward to working
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
with if that does pass into law um but
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
we are constantly looking to improve our
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
processes uh and we're somewhat I don't
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
want to say forced into doing it but but
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
we we have to constantly evolve because
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
our games and our rooms are evolving um
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
Chara gaming is growing and so we're
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
trying to meet the the demands of the
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
increase in volume um that that has
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
occurred based on those those
 
00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:08.920 align:start position:0%

representative

00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you madam chair um my question
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
is for Mr coni um on page
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
two line 17 no excuse me 16 starting on
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
line 16 it says not withstanding any
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
other provision of law no person shall
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
be issued or hold the license if in the
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
opinion of the Attorney General such
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
person is not fit to be associated with
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
racing the state where attorney general
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
was um stricken previously is it
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
supposed could be remaining there that
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's up to the attorney general at the
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
end or is that something else you wanted
 
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
to change no that that should remain in
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
place um if you look at the way that
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
this is structured the Lottery
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
Commission shall
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
confer uh with the attorney general and
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh and ultimately the decision should be
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
um whether the Attorney General decides
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
that the person should be um associated
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
with racing again this was not a a um
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
attempt to take that decision-making
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility away from the Attorney
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
General's office it was a an attempt to
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
assist in the overall flow of these
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
investigations by taking some of the leg
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
work off of the
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
AG's office's plate um but ultimately we
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
our our uh intention was for the
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to
 
01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:27.799 align:start position:0%
make the final determination on
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
suitability thank you followup yes thank
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um just if you could
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
real on the part where it says a person
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
is not fit can you explain to us if you
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
if you can just briefly um has that
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
standard been tested in an appeal or in
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
the courts not fit is there a definition
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
of not
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
fit there is not a there is not a formal
 
01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
um definition of Fitness um and it is
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat subjective by Nature um
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
generally the what the attorney general
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
and other gaming um Regulators look at
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
is um criminal
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.190 align:start position:0%
is um criminal
convictions

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
convictions
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
associations um sources of money um and
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
whether those people are whether any of
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
those things indicate that somebody
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
lacks Trust trustworthiness um to be
 
01:02:29.549 --> 01:02:29.559 align:start position:0%
associated with uh with with gaming and
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
in our state in particular with
 
01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:33.279 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming um because these
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
people are not just um running um casino
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
games they're also acting as fiduciaries
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
for charitable funds that flow through
 
01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
those rooms um so uh to my knowledge
 
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative that has not been tested
 
01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
in uh an appeal um I am aware that um
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
we we've had a few people who have who
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
have not received licenses um in those
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
instances they've been for very sort of
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
bright line issues with respect to
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
criminal convictions um but those have
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
not been appeal to my to my knowledge
 
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.150 align:start position:0%
not been appeal to my to my knowledge
thank

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
you uh I have a question this maybe to
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
representative of Brony uh it keeps
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
saying associated with
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
racing is that the correct terminology
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
because the Lottery Commission is has a
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
great is responsible for a great deal
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
more things than just
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
race so
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
true Madam chair yes R Romy yeah you
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
know this this this all this whole bill
 
01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:45.789 align:start position:0%
know this this this all this whole bill
was

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
originally embedded in the historic
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
racing Bill uh that's uh that was just
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
passed in out of committee on ways and
 
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.190 align:start position:0%
passed in out of committee on ways and
means

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh but we decided to separate it out and
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
make it its own bill and that that is
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
the reason may have the racing focus on
 
01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:06.630 align:start position:0%
the reason may have the racing focus on
it

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh it really is it really is really more
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
than just
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
racing uh it really is all of really all
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
Lottery good gaming or charitable gaming
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
or something like that be a better term
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
I I think so okay thank
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
comments questions well I I have my hand
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
up as well so
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh yeah I remember the other other
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
thing um uh it was someone mentioned
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
about uh the fact that uh there's going
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
to be a joint committee review a meeting
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
meeting of House and Senate review of
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
char gaming that pass there's a house
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
version of the bill that did pass uh and
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
I think it was already on consent
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
calendar and there's a senate version my
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
understanding is going to is going to
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
pass as well we'll reconcile those where
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a top to bottom look
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
at charal gaming and ask all the tough
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
questions about where it is where it's
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
going so just that's going on in the
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
background just want to pass that along
 
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.829 align:start position:0%
background just want to pass that along
thank

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
533 right seeing none close the public
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:06:05.349 align:start position:0%
533 right seeing none close the public
hearing

01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
I would I would say it's obvious this
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
bill needs a bit of fine-tuning at the
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
very least
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie do you want to
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
take that on and come up with an
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
amendment for
 
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
I hope so yes and uh change racing Mayer
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
at it I I think gaming is more
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate because there's there's not
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
on I think gaming is Tech is aoad term
 
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.990 align:start position:0%
on I think gaming is Tech is aoad term
not

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
whatever gaming is what we're talking
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
about the most of it charitable but some
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
of it isn't what is charitable
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
exactly mam chair
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm this is representative fellows
 
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.630 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm this is representative fellows
please

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
proceed um I'm just wondering if it's if
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
it says racing in there it might not
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
that might not even be the correct place
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
if that's in a section that's just about
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
racing all right I
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
think very good representative goalie I
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
trust you'll have fun with that one I
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
good yes if I may um I'm wondering since
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative abrami mentioned the uh
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
Joint Committee that's supposed to be
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
looking at these kinds of issues uh if
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
rather than the Standalone bill that has
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
this many
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
problems perhaps that joint committee
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
should really include this in their
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
conclusions that's something to
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
discuss um I think that the the
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
questions and issues appear to
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
be generally fairly minor Bo smithing as
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative goalie said rather
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
than the procedural point of the bill
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
namely to to establish a structure for
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
investigation we haven't heard anyone
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
saying there's any issues with that and
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's what the committee would look at
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
the word smithing is entirely separate
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
right and I understand that but uh
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
taking into account what representative
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
fellows said and representative bra
 
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
abami said that they were aiming this at
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
the historic racing which apparently is
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
going through but has not yet been fully
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
established so I don't think we want to
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate that portion from this and I
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
don't know do we need to
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
examine uh how to include both of those
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
issues in one
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh I believe that from what
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative bramy said that this had
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
been one bill and was this part was
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
split off except they didn't clean up
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
the language so uh we will be represent
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
B will be working on an amendment to
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
clean up the language and we will
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
consider this next week for scheduling
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
purposes we have hearings on Monday and
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
Wednesday next week the
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
24th and we should have time to uh exact
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
bills on the on Monday the 22nd and
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
24th representative
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chairman I might
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
point out that uh that so-called
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
historic racing actually is um is a slot
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
machine it's not it's not read rcing at
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
all um it's a slot machine so it it's it
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong under racing at all um
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
and so in addition to the colleagues
 
01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
other remarks that that's something that
 
01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
in yes I agree but uh I think given the
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
grammar and Clarity issues that have
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
been brought up I'd like to wait for
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
further discussion until we have that
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
clean up document available oh yeah no
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else that anyone
 
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:06.230 align:start position:0%
needs to bring to the committee's
 
01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.590 align:start position:0%
needs to bring to the committee's
[Music]

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
attention seeing none we will all have a
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
chance to get some exercise we're
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
resuming at
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
1:15 for the non- gerain amendment on
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%

03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
that's

03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:55.070 align:start position:0%
 
Madam

03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I think we're turned on we
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
are yeah you are um I just have a quick
 
03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
question before you begin I I wonder if
 
03:13:06.030 --> 03:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
you saw the email that I sent you at uh
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
lunchtime yes I did and I was looking
 
03:13:11.790 --> 03:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
for those people on the uh in the
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
attendee list
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay well I see the one who wants to
 
03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:19.510 align:start position:0%
okay well I see the one who wants to
speak

03:13:19.510 --> 03:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:13:22.349 --> 03:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
ah okay we'll move him up good I just
 
03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
thanks here I see that some people are
 
03:13:31.830 --> 03:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
listed as Edna I was myself earlier and
 
03:13:34.110 --> 03:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
renamed myself but maybe that would be
 
03:13:36.670 --> 03:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to those who are on here and
 
03:13:39.469 --> 03:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
listed as Edna instead of their own
 
03:13:42.750 --> 03:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
name well one of the labels of Edna is
 
03:13:44.030 --> 03:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
room since we don't have a
 
03:13:48.990 --> 03:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
bill let's see who the other one is
 
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
looks like representative Schmidt just
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
came in yeah that is a mysterious um
 
03:13:57.150 --> 03:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
unexplained phenomenon we've had that
 
03:13:59.309 --> 03:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
for weeks where people have come in as
 
03:14:01.710 --> 03:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
as the committee name and I rename you
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
as quickly as I can and
 
03:14:08.309 --> 03:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
um you know it's um it's yet to be
 
03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
figured out why anybody because nobody
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
has sent a label of
 
03:14:18.750 --> 03:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
Edna yes well it uh it's one of the M
 
03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably a feature in Zoom that we
 
03:14:25.590 --> 03:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't know about well I see two two
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
separate things that say Edna one is
 
03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
committee room but the other one doesn't
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
have any picture or anything yes I think
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's the other computer that we thought
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
the clerk would be using a um a computer
 
03:14:42.190 --> 03:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
so this morning the tech set up the
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
clerk work computer and for a while it
 
03:14:46.990 --> 03:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
was just called chair that seemed
 
03:14:49.710 --> 03:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so I called it Edna so the
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
two ednas are are really just computers
 
03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
with no person near them and if any
 
03:14:59.389 --> 03:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
others pop up I I hope to rename them
 
03:15:02.469 --> 03:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
quickly I me the computer start talking
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
they will
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
be I was just thinking about that
 
03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
memories of
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
2001 exactly all right it's 115
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
welcome to back to Edna we're having a
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on a non- gerain Amendment which
 
03:15:21.950 --> 03:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
completely replaces the text of House
 
03:15:24.910 --> 03:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 141 and I call Representative shu
 
03:15:26.990 --> 03:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
to present her
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you madam chair um with
 
03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:32.469 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you madam chair um with
the

03:15:32.469 --> 03:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
um discussion that we had around House
 
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:36.790 align:start position:0%
um discussion that we had around House
Bill

03:15:36.790 --> 03:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
141 and the fact that there were
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
apparent difficulties in that bill and
 
03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that the committee sees fit to
 
03:15:51.630 --> 03:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
dispense with that particular bill in
 
03:15:56.150 --> 03:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
format I'm presenting the basic text the
 
03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
exact text of House Bill
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
1561 from
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
2020 uh which is allowing a county to
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
exempt its chief administrative officer
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
from compulsory participation in the
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
um I present this amendment particularly
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
at the request of our a hopeful new
 
03:16:25.389 --> 03:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
administrative officer for Marat County
 
03:16:29.229 --> 03:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
he has not accepted that title as yet in
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
hopes that this bill will be
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
passed because he uh currently has over
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
30 years in group two
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
retirement and if he accepted this
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
position as his full-time employment he
 
03:16:47.469 --> 03:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
would have to go into group
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
one uh I see um Stuart Tracy who is one
 
03:16:54.269 --> 03:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
of our marac County
 
03:16:57.550 --> 03:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners on the zoom and I assume
 
03:16:58.990 --> 03:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
he's willing to
 
03:17:03.710 --> 03:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
testify and explain um what that means
 
03:17:06.750 --> 03:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
to this individual and how the County
 
03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in maram County feel about
 
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
it the bill previously was presented on
 
03:17:15.150 --> 03:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
beh half of a similar employee from
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County last
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
year and I will state that this
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee Edna passed that bill on a
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
vote of
 
03:17:31.189 --> 03:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
16-2 and it later passed the house on
 
03:17:32.469 --> 03:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
the consent
 
03:17:36.429 --> 03:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
calendar however due to uh well as what
 
03:17:39.590 --> 03:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
happened to many bills last year it died
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
a covid death when it arrived at the
 
03:17:46.830 --> 03:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
it um so with that um I will take
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any but most
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
likely uh if it's of a technical nature
 
03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
either Mr Tracy or hopefully Marty
 
03:17:59.510 --> 03:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
Carlin can answer um specific questions
 
03:18:01.790 --> 03:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
about what this would do for the
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
individual and for the retirement system
 
03:18:06.750 --> 03:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions for
 
03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions for
representative

03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:13.309 --> 03:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
sh yeses pearon you chair thank you
 
03:18:16.269 --> 03:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
representative shu is is the concern
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
from this individual
 
03:18:23.950 --> 03:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
the due to a little bit of a complexity
 
03:18:28.950 --> 03:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
to to meld group one time and group two
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
time together or is this really someone
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
who wants to collect their pension while
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
they're drawing a salary in another
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
position no I don't believe that's
 
03:18:41.990 --> 03:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
what's being contemplated uh I think it
 
03:18:45.630 --> 03:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
is is the concern about having 30 years
 
03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
plus in group two and then uh this
 
03:18:53.189 --> 03:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
individual likely due to his age uh
 
03:18:55.150 --> 03:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
stands to reason he would be working
 
03:18:59.469 --> 03:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
another five possibly 10 years and those
 
03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
last five to 10 years would be group
 
03:19:06.670 --> 03:19:06.680 align:start position:0%
one um I think Mr Tracy can tell you
 
03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:07.469 align:start position:0%
one um I think Mr Tracy can tell you
more

03:19:07.469 --> 03:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
detail um as the Commissioners
 
03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
considered this obviously since it was a
 
03:19:15.870 --> 03:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel M they went into executive
 
03:19:20.469 --> 03:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
session so I'm sure he can impart um as
 
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
as is able to be made public uh about
 
03:19:23.359 --> 03:19:26.030 align:start position:0%
as is able to be made public uh about
their

03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.910 --> 03:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
considerations thank you other questions
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:39.150 --> 03:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair um is it
 
03:19:41.469 --> 03:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
not the case representative Shu that the
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
commissioners as the administrators of
 
03:19:46.110 --> 03:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
the county have the County's best
 
03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
interests uh in at heart and uh and and
 
03:19:54.429 --> 03:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
and have endorsed this uh this proposal
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh for us to
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
consider um I would assume that to be
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
the case but since commissioner Tracy is
 
03:20:04.630 --> 03:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
here I would let him Express
 
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
that yes okay I will I will address that
 
03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
question to him when it's his time thank
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
you commissioner r has called in to
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
express her support she can't make the
 
03:20:20.189 --> 03:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
meeting um I do have a question
 
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative Shu I don't if you know
 
03:20:26.910 --> 03:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
the answer if this person is Exempted
 
03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
from participating in the retirement
 
03:20:32.830 --> 03:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
system will the county be paying the
 
03:20:32.840 --> 03:20:33.990 align:start position:0%
system will the county be paying the
approved

03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
approved
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
liability on on his
 
03:20:41.910 --> 03:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
salary um again I would refer that to uh
 
03:20:44.670 --> 03:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Tracy I would think that
 
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
the uh Commissioners looked at
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank
 
03:20:57.309 --> 03:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
else um representative sh is there a
 
03:21:02.510 --> 03:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
particular reason why this this is not
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
just for counties this is for
 
03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well why were
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities included in this if this
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
is really
 
03:21:13.950 --> 03:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
start that that is the current law
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities have this ability all
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill does is add the words and
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
counties and Board of Commissioners as
 
03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
apologies that's one of the reasons that
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't see it as a large Wrinkle in
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
the plan um all that this would do is
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
add Poss possibly and not everyone would
 
03:21:46.710 --> 03:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it the administrative
 
03:21:49.630 --> 03:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
officers for counties and as you know we
 
03:21:52.349 --> 03:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
have 10 counties in New Hampshire so at
 
03:21:57.189 --> 03:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
the most this would only involve 10
 
03:22:00.670 --> 03:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you representative
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative Shu do you know if this
 
03:22:10.510 --> 03:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
provision that exists now for the
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities if that was part of the
 
03:22:15.910 --> 03:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
original legislation when they set up
 
03:22:18.510 --> 03:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
the retirement system or if it came
 
03:22:21.550 --> 03:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
about sometime since
 
03:22:24.510 --> 03:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
then um I'm sorry representative fellas
 
03:22:29.309 --> 03:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
I did not check the statute to see the
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
adoptive dates um I don't know if um
 
03:22:36.269 --> 03:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
Miss smling has the ability to check
 
03:22:38.429 --> 03:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
that at the moment perhaps she could
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
tell us I'm I'm sure the section has
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
been amended many times times it and we
 
03:22:45.189 --> 03:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
it would take a bit of research to
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
determine which of the changes included
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
that most of 100a has been amended
 
03:22:57.070 --> 03:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
true it likely uh would date back I
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
believe there was a major overhaul at
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
one time and that's
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
probably what you would find as
 
03:23:12.510 --> 03:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
recent represent sitech this may be for
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
Mr trachy uh but I'll ask the question I
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
know of one municipality that
 
03:23:22.630 --> 03:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
hired someone who had uh group one this
 
03:23:27.309 --> 03:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
is all group one uh the person
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
established that they had in
 
03:23:31.950 --> 03:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
mind an
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
LLC he was the sole employee of the
 
03:23:40.990 --> 03:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
LLC and the town hired the LLC to do the
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
be the town
 
03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
manager and uh got got away got around
 
03:23:51.469 --> 03:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
it in that way uh is are you aware of
 
03:23:57.349 --> 03:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
that situation uh is that just uh a
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
that I suspect that may have been the
 
03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
town of Salem might have been might have
 
03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
been thank
 
03:24:15.870 --> 03:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
you and speak for sale baile you have a
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
chairman just for somebody knew what's
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
group one and group
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
two um probably Marty Carlin would be
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
the best person to describe that um I
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
can tell you uh briefly representative
 
03:24:36.030 --> 03:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
that group two tends to be First
 
03:24:39.070 --> 03:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
Responders firefighters police
 
03:24:43.790 --> 03:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
officers uh who have different um
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
contribution rates and return rates and
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
regulations involving their part of the
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh retirement system group one tends to
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
be teachers and regular state employees
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
and Municipal Employees but I think if
 
03:25:03.710 --> 03:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
you want more details than that uh Mr
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
Carlin is probably the best person to
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
answer thank you yes the the useful
 
03:25:14.150 --> 03:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
distinction is group two is specifically
 
03:25:17.710 --> 03:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
defined so that it policemen fire
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and that's about it
 
03:25:24.910 --> 03:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
everyone else is group one and group two
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
pays more but they are not subject to
 
03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:30.389 align:start position:0%
pays more but they are not subject to
Social

03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:35.189 --> 03:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
try thank you madam chair and and
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:25:42.189 --> 03:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
Stuart Tracy and I'm a marac County
 
03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioner and I want to thank
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative Shu for bringing this um
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment forward as she stated
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is a a piece of legislation that
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
was considered in 2020 and U passed by
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
the house on the consent calendar but uh
 
03:26:05.229 --> 03:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
got bogged down and tabled in the Senate
 
03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
because of uh covid and it it had the
 
03:26:11.950 --> 03:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
same fate as U many many other bills
 
03:26:14.670 --> 03:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't think the Senate's action
 
03:26:17.550 --> 03:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
was any prejudice against the bill it
 
03:26:20.229 --> 03:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
was just that it it wasn't going to
 
03:26:23.110 --> 03:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
reach the uh the floor of the Senate uh
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
for 2020
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
consideration um in marac County and in
 
03:26:29.990 --> 03:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
obviously this will apply to every
 
03:26:33.750 --> 03:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
County but what we were looking for in
 
03:26:36.710 --> 03:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation is the ability to have
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
a county executive have the same rights
 
03:26:42.189 --> 03:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
03:26:45.630 --> 03:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities as administrators of
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities that currently have the
 
03:26:50.950 --> 03:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
option to opt out of the retirement
 
03:26:54.309 --> 03:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
system and that's what we're uh hoping
 
03:26:56.189 --> 03:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
we can do in Mart County we have an
 
03:27:00.189 --> 03:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to keep um a very good
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
employee who's currently U the
 
03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
employee who's currently U the
correction

03:27:03.750 --> 03:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
correction
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent um and we are considering
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
and would like to have him become the
 
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
County Administrator but
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
this um issue of the retirement the
 
03:27:17.790 --> 03:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
group two Etc is is an issue with him
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we would certainly like to
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
accommodate him um and others obviously
 
03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
this would apply to to all the counties
 
03:27:30.110 --> 03:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
and their County Executives but um so
 
03:27:34.950 --> 03:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's the story behind it um I did uh
 
03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
have communications with commissioner
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
Reen and as I understand she has
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
registered her support commissioner
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
Spalding up contacted him he's away but
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
Peter Spalding is the third commissioner
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
and uh we've had conversations about uh
 
03:27:53.309 --> 03:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
various ways of trying to to address
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
this situation and I would feel with
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
most confidence that um he would also be
 
03:28:01.189 --> 03:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
supportive but I I didn't make the
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
connection this morning but um so
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
obviously the the board is very
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to being able to keep um the
 
03:28:13.229 --> 03:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
employee of our current um correction
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent who we hope will become
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the County Administrator and I'd
 
03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer any
 
03:28:23.389 --> 03:28:23.399 align:start position:0%

03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:26.600 align:start position:0%

uh that the Commissioners have uh
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%

03:29:14.189 --> 03:29:14.199 align:start position:0%

03:29:16.950 --> 03:29:16.960 align:start position:0%

you too
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
Stuart so commissioner I had a question
 
03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't seem to specify it
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
exactly but would the County be willing
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
or I would expect the county to continue
 
03:29:50.349 --> 03:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
to pay the approved
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
liability portion of the contribution
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
for any employee that was Exempted is
 
03:29:58.510 --> 03:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
that your understanding as
 
03:30:01.110 --> 03:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
well um when you brought that up Madam
 
03:30:03.189 --> 03:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
chair it's the first time I heard that
 
03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
issue raised and and so I'm not quite
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure how to address that and and um I'd
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to do a little bit more research
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
about that but um I would assume that
 
03:30:18.990 --> 03:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
folks who are Exempted from the
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system I'm not sure what the
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
approved liability would be and how that
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be calculated um but that's
 
03:30:27.710 --> 03:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
something we would definitely look into
 
03:30:29.309 --> 03:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
but as I said this is the first I've
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
heard of that Madam
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
chair okay representative fellows thank
 
03:30:38.590 --> 03:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um commissioner tury so
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
when I look at the statute one of the
 
03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
things I see is that the exemption
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
applies to a person at initial um hiring
 
03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
or appointment but we're talking about a
 
03:30:54.630 --> 03:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
position here that's you are currently
 
03:30:58.990 --> 03:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
employing so how do you think
 
03:31:02.110 --> 03:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
this change to statute
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
will um help the situation that you're
 
03:31:08.750 --> 03:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with um the the person in Mart
 
03:31:10.590 --> 03:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
County that's under consideration is
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
currently the correction superintendent
 
03:31:16.269 --> 03:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
so he would then be taking a new
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
position with the county as the County
 
03:31:20.760 --> 03:31:24.670 align:start position:0%
position with the county as the County
Administrator

03:31:24.670 --> 03:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.269 --> 03:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
so yes to follow up if that's the
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh um a different position and and it
 
03:31:34.990 --> 03:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be before he he accepted
 
03:31:37.750 --> 03:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
the position which is why he's been uh
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:31:39.960 --> 03:31:41.830 align:start position:0%
in the
acting

03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
acting
 
03:31:43.950 --> 03:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
administrator for a while
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
now so my followup question is it well
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
the follow-up has to do with the fact
 
03:31:53.469 --> 03:31:53.479 align:start position:0%
that it says initial hire and this
 
03:31:57.790 --> 03:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
person was hired a long time ago um he's
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
just moving to a different position
 
03:32:03.750 --> 03:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
which frequently happens and the
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
retirement system has an option for how
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
you uh calculate the retirement for a
 
03:32:11.469 --> 03:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
person who's been in group two and group
 
03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
one it's kind of like an average of the
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
benefits you know between the two
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
although I don't know the specific
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
details of that so why isn't that a
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
solution that would work but I I don't
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
see initial
 
03:32:26.910 --> 03:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
hiring how you get past that part of it
 
03:32:29.229 --> 03:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
so if you could just address those two
 
03:32:34.469 --> 03:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
issues well um he's um been employed by
 
03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire as I
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
understand it and the Department of
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections he's also been employed by
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County at one point and marac I
 
03:32:45.389 --> 03:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
believe he's been at marac County for
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
about six years but um he's been in the
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
position of Correction
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent so this is now a
 
03:32:57.070 --> 03:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
consideration for his employment as
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
County Administrator so that that would
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
be where it would come under the new
 
03:33:01.920 --> 03:33:03.429 align:start position:0%
be where it would come under the new
hire

03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
hire
 
03:33:05.229 --> 03:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
category that that would be my
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation on
 
03:33:10.510 --> 03:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
it so so just to follow up the second
 
03:33:12.910 --> 03:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
half of the question had to do with
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanism in place for how you
 
03:33:19.070 --> 03:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
can kind of like average somebody who's
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
been in group two and group one did you
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
look at that option that's not
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
satisfactory uh that's not something
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's satisfactory to as I understand
 
03:33:28.990 --> 03:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to speak for the
 
03:33:31.710 --> 03:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
employee or get into specifics about
 
03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
that but um generally speaking what
 
03:33:38.830 --> 03:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
we're asking for is the same allowance
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's given to city and Town
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
administrators so uh we think that it's
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
um a very legitimate request on behalf
 
03:33:51.469 --> 03:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the counties and that those uh
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
positions and there's only 10 in the
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
state that would qualify potentially
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
qualify for um this provision um in in
 
03:34:02.750 --> 03:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the melding of the group one
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
and two I I I don't know how that would
 
03:34:07.710 --> 03:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
play out with this specific person I
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't know the details of that
 
03:34:11.520 --> 03:34:16.189 align:start position:0%
don't know the details of that
thank

03:34:16.189 --> 03:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
store for coming and testifying I just
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
want to get clarification because I've
 
03:34:28.830 --> 03:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
heard it explain two different ways um
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
is this
 
03:34:33.389 --> 03:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
individual with the corrections or is he
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
I've also heard the statement that he is
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
also the acting Chief
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
administrator he's currently the
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
correction super superintendent and he's
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
the acting County Administrator so he is
 
03:34:47.950 --> 03:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
capacity so and I just want to follow
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
back then to representative fellow's
 
03:34:56.110 --> 03:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
question as to how you get around that
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
if he's acting and this is supposed to
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
go into the effect at the time of
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
initial hiring or appointment if he's
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
appointed as acting he's already in the
 
03:35:08.189 --> 03:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
position so how does this get around
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
that well it it would certainly apply if
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
and when he becomes the actual uh County
 
03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
Administrator so that would be the
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
actual date of hiring so it would be
 
03:35:24.269 --> 03:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
specific to a date upon which he assumes
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
the title of County
 
03:35:33.189 --> 03:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you um I think uh in
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
response to that thinking about it and
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
as chair of the Marram County delegation
 
03:35:48.030 --> 03:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
I will say that this individual was
 
03:35:52.429 --> 03:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
hired as um the corrections
 
03:35:55.870 --> 03:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent by the county and has
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
only been act as administrator in the
 
03:36:02.070 --> 03:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
absence of the former
 
03:36:05.309 --> 03:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
administrator uh to my mind and I think
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
what um commissioner Tracy is saying is
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
they have not officially appointed him
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
as the
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
administrator so the statute says upon
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
hiring or appointment so at the date
 
03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
that he is officially appointed the
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
administrator to my mind that's what
 
03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
meets the uh demands of the statute
 
03:36:32.319 --> 03:36:34.389 align:start position:0%
meets the uh demands of the statute
thank

03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
you very much represent black
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
us all right
 
03:36:45.349 --> 03:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
PE mam chair the this position within
 
03:36:49.389 --> 03:36:49.399 align:start position:0%
the county historically has been a group
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
one position is that
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's as far as yes that's
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
correct so then this this
 
03:37:00.269 --> 03:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
position has
 
03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility um to the unfunded
 
03:37:06.990 --> 03:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
liability there's historical
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility to to that debt so I have
 
03:37:14.110 --> 03:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about the county making
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
this position exempt without
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
reassurances and safeguards that this
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the debt that needs to be paid for
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
this position will actually
 
03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
this position will actually
occur

03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
so representative to address that again
 
03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned to the chair um the
 
03:37:36.910 --> 03:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability aspect of this um
 
03:37:39.790 --> 03:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
question is one that we had not heard
 
03:37:39.800 --> 03:37:40.950 align:start position:0%
question is one that we had not heard
before

03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have um you know sought legal
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
counsel relative to how to address that
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
um but that has not been an issue that
 
03:37:51.550 --> 03:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
has been presented to us and if it is an
 
03:37:53.710 --> 03:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
issue then and it's something that we're
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
liable for the county would certainly um
 
03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
step up to that
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
but I have not um heard of it being an
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
issue and we would assume the liability
 
03:38:07.189 --> 03:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
necessary thank
 
03:38:09.319 --> 03:38:11.550 align:start position:0%

how is he perform two full-time jobs I
 
03:38:24.510 --> 03:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
guess well he he's um very well skilled
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%

03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
him for County Administrator um he does
 
03:38:33.229 --> 03:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
have um tremendous support at the
 
03:38:35.950 --> 03:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
corrections level and um in the
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office uh on the finance
 
03:38:41.229 --> 03:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
side and the administration ative side
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
of both um operations so um it has been
 
03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
difficult at times but um he's a very
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
skilled gentleman and he's been able to
 
03:38:53.950 --> 03:38:53.960 align:start position:0%

you
 
03:38:59.070 --> 03:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh I was wondering if the position of
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
County Administrator is an appointed
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
position or you go op do a
 
03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh job search or whatever how does it
 
03:39:11.910 --> 03:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
how is it normally
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
filled well um that's that's a good
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
question representative um it's it's
 
03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
appointed and it's it's a position that
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
serves um it's appointed by the County
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and um I'm not sure how
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
they have done searches in the past but
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
I do remember way back during my tenure
 
03:39:36.830 --> 03:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I was a county commissioner from 1988
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
to 2000 and we were able to
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
um fill a position of County
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
Administrator back then with uh you know
 
03:39:50.670 --> 03:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners uh doing you know I
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say a broad search or or
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
whatever but I think it's up to the
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
discretion of the Board of Commissioners
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
in each County as to how they handle the
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
requirements for posting it and
 
03:40:02.080 --> 03:40:03.950 align:start position:0%
requirements for posting it and
advertising

03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
03:40:07.870 --> 03:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
Etc thank you representative
 
03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair uh a
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
question has just Arisen that that I'd
 
03:40:16.110 --> 03:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
like to speak to um because I think it's
 
03:40:19.950 --> 03:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
it it's important for the midi to hear
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh the that it's not unheard of uh for
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh uh counties uh in the case of a truly
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
skilled uh uh and extraordinary
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
individual uh to have somebody serving
 
03:40:37.229 --> 03:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
in multiple roles uh as the delegation
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
chair in Strafford County uh I I'm aware
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
of the fact that straford County employs
 
03:40:45.189 --> 03:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
a single individual who is the County
 
03:40:48.030 --> 03:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
Administrator and also the nursing home
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
administrator uh a role of uh quite
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
higher level in terms of numbers of
 
03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
people um and also complexity of U of um
 
03:41:03.309 --> 03:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
individual responsibility with frail
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
individuals atend at the end of their
 
03:41:09.510 --> 03:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
life um and Stafford County has had one
 
03:41:12.269 --> 03:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
person do this job for the 20 years that
 
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
I've been in the uh in in stford County
 
03:41:18.309 --> 03:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
politics um so there's nothing
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
extraordinary about this when you have
 
03:41:22.189 --> 03:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
the right kind of person and when you
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
have the right kind of person you need
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
to keep that person so I think that's
 
03:41:28.149 --> 03:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
important for the committee to be aware
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
youor sh you have another
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
question uh just to comment madams if
 
03:41:41.229 --> 03:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
there's no one else uh wai in to speak
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
um again as chair of the delegation and
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
um our honorable chair is the former
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
chair of the delegation for Mar County
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
also uh I we are in a strange position
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
we had uh as representative Schmidt said
 
03:42:01.070 --> 03:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
our former
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
administrator uh was a long-term very
 
03:42:06.910 --> 03:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
trusted employee uh who knew every
 
03:42:09.630 --> 03:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
aspect of the budget for 25 I believe
 
03:42:09.640 --> 03:42:10.790 align:start position:0%
aspect of the budget for 25 I believe
years

03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
who then retired and the Commissioners
 
03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
went out of the county and uh hired an
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
individual who
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
just I don't want to cast dispersions
 
03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
but was um not adequate to the job I'll
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
just put it that way and when that
 
03:42:35.149 --> 03:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
individual left um somewhat abruptly um
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
this individual stepped up and and just
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
started doing what needed to be done and
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
um as commissioner Tracy says he's an
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary individual to be able to
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
Jud uh position uh along with
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
specifically being the superintendent of
 
03:42:58.750 --> 03:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
the House of
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr Carlin from the retirement system
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%

03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
for him so I'd like to recognize
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%

Carlin representing the New Hampshire
 
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh nhrs uh did not
 
03:43:24.349 --> 03:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
have a position last year on House Bill
 
03:43:27.389 --> 03:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
1561 which is the same language as the
 
03:43:29.309 --> 03:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed uh this year for
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 141 um this would at Max uh
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
impact 10 potential positions that are
 
03:43:40.510 --> 03:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
membership um required in the retirement
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
system that would become membership
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
optional um the uh Municipal exemption
 
03:43:48.990 --> 03:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
for chief administrative officer Town
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
manager Etc has been in uh 100a since
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
1973 um you know and there are
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
communities that do uh exercise that
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
option uh not I don't I don't have a
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
count on how many do um but basically
 
03:44:08.269 --> 03:44:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's something that the governing body
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
at the time of initial hire for that
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
position um you know can make that
 
03:44:15.070 --> 03:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
election to the retirement system for
 
03:44:19.149 --> 03:44:19.159 align:start position:0%
the person not to be enrolled um so it's
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's the statute a22 is hired for the
 
03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
specific position so in the case of an
 
03:44:26.910 --> 03:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
incumbent uh you know with that employer
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
who's in a in a different position where
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
membership is required it wouldn't be an
 
03:44:33.389 --> 03:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
issue it's Point initial hiring or
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
appointment for the chief administrator
 
03:44:39.550 --> 03:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh position is is when that option would
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
take take effect um we we read the
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
statute um initial to be so when
 
03:44:47.550 --> 03:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is hired for that specific
 
03:44:52.030 --> 03:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
position um and the only other thing I
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
would mention because it it came up is
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
there there are there is something
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
called split benefits where someone with
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
service in group one and group two uh
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
would get a a benefit um you know based
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
on their service in each in each group
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh however um and I don't know if this
 
03:45:11.189 --> 03:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
is the case uh in the county issue but
 
03:45:14.189 --> 03:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
in general terms if someone moves from a
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
group two police and fire position into
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
a group one uh employer and teacher
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
position there's a couple of uh benefits
 
03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
associated with group two that don't
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
transfer over into group one um they
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
would they would lose eligibility for
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
that those are there's a um a 50% uh
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
benefit uh paid to a surviving spouse if
 
03:45:36.590 --> 03:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
the the retiree passes away and there's
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
no actual reduction on that 50% and and
 
03:45:42.389 --> 03:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
also for a group two members who are in
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
service on uh June 30th of 2020 uh I'm
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
sorry June 30th of 2000 uh when they
 
03:45:51.870 --> 03:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
retire they would be eligible for the
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy which is an insurance
 
03:45:55.670 --> 03:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
premium offset if you're getting your
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
insurance through your former employer
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
um so that that that can be a fairly um
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
significant loss there so I'm not sure
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
if that applies in this case but um
 
03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
group two members uh do have those two
 
03:46:10.510 --> 03:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
benefits that they would lose switching
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.830 --> 03:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr Carlin do the
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities that exempt their Chief
 
03:46:21.790 --> 03:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
administrator from the membership of the
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
retirement system pay the UA
 
03:46:30.269 --> 03:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
not the the the Lo the Lost salary if
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
you will or the Lost contributions on
 
03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
that position um you know are just sort
 
03:46:41.710 --> 03:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
of spread out among the other you know
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
14,000 or so employees in group one um
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know and and um you know it it's
 
03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
quite quite a number of decimals out on
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
the employer rate when you when you
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
round out you know the contributions
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
lost for uh you know a single exempt
 
03:46:59.189 --> 03:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
position thank you representative
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair hello
 
03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:04.269 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair hello
Marty

03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
Marty
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
hello can the nire retirement system
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
calculate what the UA is
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
for this
 
03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
position as of right now uh we don't
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
have a handy way um to do that like you
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
know we haven't done that in the past
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
even you know for individuals because
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know it is a you know it's it's
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
a multi-employer plan and it's it's sort
 
03:47:31.870 --> 03:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
of an aggregate calculation I mean that
 
03:47:33.670 --> 03:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
I can't say it's not impossible but it's
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
something we would probably have to go
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
to our actuary for um you know and get
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
um you know you know pay some money to
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
get a calculation I'm not sure what they
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
what they would certify how how valid
 
03:47:49.389 --> 03:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
that number is um because it's it's
 
03:47:50.670 --> 03:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
you're really when you're looking at one
 
03:47:52.510 --> 03:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
individual you're looking at who did
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
they work for in 2001 and what was the
 
03:47:57.590 --> 03:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
liability that year were they in group
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
one or in group two so so that there's
 
03:48:03.149 --> 03:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
you know it's a lot of equs mar not not
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
for the the person we're speaking of
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the position the
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
county that positions UAA not not an
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
individual car the annual reports that
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
the retirement system puts out and that
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
I I treasure have a statement that
 
03:48:22.590 --> 03:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's so much for the normal
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
contribution and so much for the UA and
 
03:48:29.229 --> 03:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that number for group one be a
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
very close
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
approximation yeah you I I see what
 
03:48:35.750 --> 03:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
where you're going representative yeah
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
there is you know the total amount um
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know for group one uh member
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
employee contributions beginning in July
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
is it's 14 point something perc and
 
03:48:49.389 --> 03:48:49.399 align:start position:0%
about 72 to 75% is attributable to the
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability so so we do have a
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the rate how much is the
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
normal cost how much is unfunded and how
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
much is the medical subsidy so you know
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
to get a backof the envelope um you know
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
calculation you would look at the salary
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know for the position being Exempted
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then what what is the UA rate for
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
that year and that that you'd get a
 
03:49:11.309 --> 03:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
number that way it wouldn't it wouldn't
 
03:49:11.319 --> 03:49:12.030 align:start position:0%
number that way it wouldn't it wouldn't
be

03:49:12.030 --> 03:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
attributable to the history of that
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
position but as a snapshot at time it
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
would show what the percentage that
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's paying for the UN unfunded
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
for all their positions thank
 
03:49:27.070 --> 03:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair I would just
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
um quote from the fiscal note that
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
originally came on House Bill
 
03:49:42.429 --> 03:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
1561 the the actuary for the retirement
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
system stated the estimated impact is
 
03:49:50.280 --> 03:49:50.290 align:start position:0%
assumed to be less than
 
03:49:50.290 --> 03:49:51.750 align:start position:0%

obviously thank you other other
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
questions there's couple of there

Schulz thank you madam chair I just
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I understand this
 
03:50:21.229 --> 03:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
correctly so this is already available
 
03:50:24.790 --> 03:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
to uh cities and towns correct correct
 
03:50:30.189 --> 03:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.389 --> 03:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
you representative uh
 
03:50:37.469 --> 03:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair I just um
 
03:50:40.950 --> 03:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
Wanted clarification about Mr Carlin
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned the medical subsidy so I
 
03:50:47.429 --> 03:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
understand the unfunded
 
03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
liability is is there something
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
comparable like if we're if we're
 
03:50:57.070 --> 03:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
potentially going to consider asking the
 
03:51:00.269 --> 03:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
um the the municipalities and and
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
counties to cover the unfunded liability
 
03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
is there also some kind of percentage
 
03:51:10.149 --> 03:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
for the medical in group two uh yes yes
 
03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is a uh oh in yeah group two it's
 
03:51:17.790 --> 03:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's a 3.21% of pay and actually while
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
um while we were asking the question I
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
did look up the unfunded for a group one
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh position for political subdivision is
 
03:51:30.189 --> 03:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
11.77% of pay effective July 1 of this
 
03:51:34.590 --> 03:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
year thank you thank you repr L thank
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and um I suppose my
 
03:51:41.149 --> 03:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
question is best
 
03:51:44.189 --> 03:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
um um because you and your colleagues
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
have I'm sure deliberated on this more
 
03:51:49.189 --> 03:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
than anybody see the advantages for the
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
county but in your discussions um have
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
there been any uh disadvantages to the
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
county what's the downside for the
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
county in
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
this uh I'm not sure I understand the
 
03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
question but you mean if the legislation
 
03:52:08.149 --> 03:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass or does I could rephrase
 
03:52:09.630 --> 03:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
that make could simpler
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
um every
 
03:52:14.309 --> 03:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
time this is a concession of sorts and
 
03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
so there's got to be an upside those are
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
clear to me the upsides what's the
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
downside for the county uh in this
 
03:52:22.760 --> 03:52:23.950 align:start position:0%
downside for the county uh in this
[Music]

03:52:23.950 --> 03:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
proposition uh I I
 
03:52:29.309 --> 03:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
guess there it's a win-win as far as I'm
 
03:52:32.910 --> 03:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
concerned but I guess maybe uh losing
 
03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
our current uh correction superintendent
 
03:52:38.550 --> 03:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
as correction superintendent and moving
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
to uh a new position I mean he he's a a
 
03:52:44.830 --> 03:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
well-respected correction superintendent
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
and he's done a great job at our
 
03:52:48.630 --> 03:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
department of corrections so perhaps
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's the downside but I think the
 
03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
biggest downside in the whole picture is
 
03:52:58.990 --> 03:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
um the possibility of losing someone of
 
03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
his caliber and and it's not just a Mart
 
03:53:04.189 --> 03:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
County issue I think it's an issue in
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
the public sector across the board where
 
03:53:09.229 --> 03:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
if you have good people you want to find
 
03:53:11.870 --> 03:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
a way to keep them and um if they're
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
doing a good job um do what you can to
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
to keep them employed and and um
 
03:53:19.710 --> 03:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
promoting from within is something that
 
03:53:23.630 --> 03:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
we've always um promoted as a board and
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
and we like to look at the talent we
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
have and so that's the biggest upside is
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh being able to retain the talent that
 
03:53:30.800 --> 03:53:32.750 align:start position:0%
uh being able to retain the talent that
we

03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:53:36.429 --> 03:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
questions yeah represent thank you thank
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr kin Ju Just just so we can put it
 
03:53:46.110 --> 03:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
in plain English and and and the rest of
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
us can fully understand this if if this
 
03:53:54.910 --> 03:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
position now becomes removed from group
 
03:53:54.920 --> 03:53:56.830 align:start position:0%
position now becomes removed from group
one

03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
03:53:59.359 --> 03:54:02.429 align:start position:0%
and there is
no

03:54:02.429 --> 03:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
statutorily driven requirement to pay
 
03:54:08.429 --> 03:54:08.439 align:start position:0%
back any calculated unfunded liability
 
03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
will this
 
03:54:12.830 --> 03:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
this debt that the county specifically
 
03:54:16.349 --> 03:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
incurred would that now be basically
 
03:54:19.469 --> 03:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
placed on the shoulders of all other
 
03:54:21.630 --> 03:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
contributors within the retirement
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
system I.E other other
 
03:54:27.750 --> 03:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities yes to to the extent if
 
03:54:30.510 --> 03:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
if the unfunded percentage is I'm going
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
to say 11% for round numbers and the
 
03:54:34.990 --> 03:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
County administrator again for round
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
number purposes salary is $100,000 there
 
03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:39.950 align:start position:0%
number purposes salary is $100,000 there
$111,000

03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
$111,000
 
03:54:42.670 --> 03:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
that all of the all of the employers
 
03:54:44.349 --> 03:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
collectively would have to contribute to
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
make up for the loss of that position
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know including some some proportion
 
03:54:50.830 --> 03:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
coming from the county itself but uh you
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
know it's it's an aggregate thing so so
 
03:54:55.870 --> 03:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
it would be shared by all the
 
03:54:59.469 --> 03:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
employers thank you our representative
 
03:55:02.429 --> 03:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
sitech yeah I'm not sure for whom this
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
question is maybe representative should
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh this legislation may seem
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
quite reasonable and consistent with the
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities sauce for the goose and
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
sauce for the gander
 
03:55:21.630 --> 03:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
but uh suppose this person comes from
 
03:55:24.269 --> 03:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
Iowa and is 40 years old and expecting
 
03:55:28.349 --> 03:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
to work 25 years perhaps uh why should
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
that person be Exempted even though this
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like this bill is crafted
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
tailored for one per for a particular
 
03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
situ situation that that's unusual that
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps unusual that somebody coming
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
from out of the blue why should that
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
person be
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
Exempted uh that's a question at large
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's sore of my mind that I think that
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
was addressed to me um I will just I'm
 
03:56:03.110 --> 03:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
not sure I will just say that um this is
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
only going to apply to this one
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
individual if if the county wants to try
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
and exempt a future um individual that
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be a question for the uh
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
time thanks
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
03:56:29.630 --> 03:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
this is a question from Mr
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
Carlin so I I know that when a group two
 
03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
person retires
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
there can be an issue about um overtime
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
pay being used as a portion of their
 
03:56:51.550 --> 03:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
what do you call it average I don't know
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
whatever that average salary is that you
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
can compute with the highest years
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
compensation there's a special
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions for that this this position
 
03:57:04.349 --> 03:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
that we're specific situation we're
 
03:57:08.110 --> 03:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
talking about here has something that's
 
03:57:08.120 --> 03:57:09.309 align:start position:0%
talking about here has something that's
seems

03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
seems
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
um somewhat related to that situation
 
03:57:15.389 --> 03:57:15.399 align:start position:0%
because we're not talking about a new
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
hire coming from totally from the
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
outside um and how that would impact the
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
system but this particular person has
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
accumulated something that's like that
 
03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:27.510 align:start position:0%
accumulated something that's like that
special

03:57:27.510 --> 03:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:57:32.349 --> 03:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
overtime pay special duty pay and has a
 
03:57:35.469 --> 03:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
higher salary right now because of that
 
03:57:39.870 --> 03:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
is is will that extra exra money above
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
what was his normal salary as just the
 
03:57:45.870 --> 03:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
um superintendent of Corrections going
 
03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
to be treated differently than his
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
normal salary um it it it it would
 
03:57:57.950 --> 03:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
depend on whether or not he was vested
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
before January 1st of 2012 which is um
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know the effective day to some of
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
the uh major changes to the pension plan
 
03:58:09.429 --> 03:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh enacted back in 2011 if if someone
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
who is vested uh prior to that date uh
 
03:58:15.670 --> 03:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
any any compensation paid uh during
 
03:58:17.950 --> 03:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
their um you know their working life
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
overtime uh things like that plus any
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
acrs of you know on you sick vacation
 
03:58:24.990 --> 03:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
time all count in that average final
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
compensation calculation for people
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
hired after um July 1 of 2011 overtime
 
03:58:34.149 --> 03:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
still counts for them as well um you
 
03:58:36.189 --> 03:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
know but those end of career payouts for
 
03:58:38.269 --> 03:58:38.279 align:start position:0%
time approvals don't count anymore and
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
for for the the folks sort of in that in
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
that middle tier um you know there's
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's some limitations on how much is
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
counted um you know but in terms of
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
specifically overtime any overtime he
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
worked in his career would fall be if it
 
03:58:55.309 --> 03:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
fell within his high three or high five
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
years of AFC you know we would still
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
calculate it um anything if if the if
 
03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
this person is working in an exempt
 
03:59:05.309 --> 03:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
position for the county none of that
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
salary is going to count toward the
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
pension going forward it would just be
 
03:59:12.189 --> 03:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
service yeah just follow up follow up
 
03:59:19.710 --> 03:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
yeah just it are there any current
 
03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
situations or has this ever come up
 
03:59:26.229 --> 03:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
before with a person getting about a
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
person being doing a job that's like
 
03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
half group two and partly group you know
 
03:59:34.630 --> 03:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
partly group a position that's group one
 
03:59:37.149 --> 03:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
and group two at the same time NOP you
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
can you can only be one or the the other
 
03:59:41.229 --> 03:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
so you know you know the the you know
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
the person can switch positions into you
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
know a statutorily defined group two
 
03:59:47.910 --> 03:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
position or group one position you know
 
03:59:49.510 --> 03:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
or if they're working in a position
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's reclassified by the legislature
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
they would switch but you know their
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
service in the group they were in you
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
know is is distinct you know from you
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
know the group one time and and um you
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
know is is distinct from the group two
 
04:00:05.750 --> 04:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
time but there's no positions that that
 
04:00:05.760 --> 04:00:06.550 align:start position:0%
time but there's no positions that that
are

04:00:06.550 --> 04:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
goie thank you madam chair and this
 
04:00:28.149 --> 04:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.710 --> 04:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
um in listening to this whole
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
conversation if this
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
individual is hired and
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:38.830 align:start position:0%
individual is hired and
working

04:00:38.830 --> 04:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
as a group two individual but also
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
is in an acting position in a group one
 
04:00:48.030 --> 04:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
scenario as
 
04:00:51.149 --> 04:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
well um how do those benefits get
 
04:00:54.429 --> 04:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
divided or split or are we
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
now paying some of the salary that he's
 
04:00:59.550 --> 04:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
acting in as a group one position going
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
towards his group two
 
04:01:04.750 --> 04:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
benefits um I I think it it I can't
 
04:01:06.550 --> 04:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
speak to this specific case because I
 
04:01:09.149 --> 04:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the you know the the County's
 
04:01:11.910 --> 04:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
agreement with this individual I I
 
04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it or had a chance to
 
04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
review it t typically in general terms
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
um you know if it's somebody who has a
 
04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
group two position um with some respons
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a separate agreement over and
 
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
above you know the superintendent's
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
position to do some extra County we may
 
04:01:28.279 --> 04:01:29.710 align:start position:0%
position to do some extra County we may
count

04:01:29.710 --> 04:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
count
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
that well actually no let me take that
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
back I think generally speaking if if
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of the work an individual
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
is doing is in is in group group one or
 
04:01:40.469 --> 04:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
group two we're going to count the
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
salary in that group with with that's
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
their primary
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
occupation uh but again I don't for this
 
04:01:49.469 --> 04:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
specific case I I don't I don't know how
 
04:01:52.149 --> 04:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're uh treating that I would I didn't
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know know about the case until the
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
hearing today um in any
 
04:02:00.269 --> 04:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
detail okay I just I'm just trying to
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
figure out how he can be acting in one
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
position as group one and also in group
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
two and combining those two if it's
 
04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
going towards group two benefits then
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's there's a big difference I I I I
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
think we we we look at which which POS
 
04:02:17.550 --> 04:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
which position is the person spend is
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
their primary occupation I think there
 
04:02:21.469 --> 04:02:21.479 align:start position:0%
were cases where you know in some of the
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
smaller towns there was a you know fire
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
chief building inspector you know and
 
04:02:28.830 --> 04:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
and the building inspector was 10 hours
 
04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
a week and you know the chief was a
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
full-time job and you know I believe in
 
04:02:34.670 --> 04:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
those sort of historical situations you
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
know counted the salary towards the
 
04:02:39.309 --> 04:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
group two
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
okay and and
 
04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
they um comment there that at the time
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
of initial hiring or appointment to be
 
04:02:49.070 --> 04:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
able to opt out that wouldn't affect us
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
even though he's act hired as a group
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
two but is acting that position that
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't exempt him I think you know
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a difference between
 
04:02:58.590 --> 04:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
somebody serving in an acting capacity
 
04:03:00.070 --> 04:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
and somebody being hired for the
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
specific position that that that's how
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
we would look at it you know from a
 
04:03:06.149 --> 04:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
legal perspective and that that is an
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
optional exemption so if the
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
the um somebody had a question for
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative shuart about somebody
 
04:03:13.870 --> 04:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
who's you know 40 years old and comes to
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know they they
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
probably part of their negotiations with
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
the employer with the county they want
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
to say hey I want to be in nhrs it's not
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
like all of the positions are exempt
 
04:03:27.630 --> 04:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
going forward it's you know and if this
 
04:03:30.030 --> 04:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
individual were to leave in the county
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
the next County Administrator you know
 
04:03:34.189 --> 04:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to be in group one or was was
 
04:03:36.670 --> 04:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
coming from you know somewhere else you
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
know that the whole the whole um
 
04:03:40.750 --> 04:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
scenario could play out again
 
04:03:43.710 --> 04:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
differently the next time around thank
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.030 --> 04:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
fellows did you did you call on me you
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
had your hand up oh I the the sound
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
quality isn't always that good thank you
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I just want to ask Mr
 
04:04:09.110 --> 04:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
Carlin if
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
if he it sounds like what I'm hearing is
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
that somebody could be in group group
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
two for 30 let's say 25 years and
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
they've been their uh grandfathers so
 
04:04:25.309 --> 04:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
you know beyond farther back than on
 
04:04:29.590 --> 04:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
2012 and they've earned that the medical
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
subsidy and the um the
 
04:04:36.910 --> 04:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
50% for the spouse that if they move to
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
group one for just one year then they
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
lose those benefits and that doesn't
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem
 
04:04:47.229 --> 04:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
fair the way the statute is constructed
 
04:04:49.550 --> 04:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's like it it applies to the those
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
benef if if you you have to retire from
 
04:04:54.269 --> 04:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
that group uh to qualify for the
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
benefits if you if you re retire from
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
group two um if you try retire from
 
04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
group one uh you would lose them I mean
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
because because they're not group one
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
benefits so it so it you know in terms
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
of the eligibility for those it's it's
 
04:05:10.189 --> 04:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.030 --> 04:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative laus related to that
 
04:05:18.189 --> 04:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
question so in this case if this
 
04:05:20.550 --> 04:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
person's been in group two long enough
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
that they've uh you know they're
 
04:05:25.389 --> 04:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
eligible for those benefits in
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
particular the retirement medical uh I
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
guess it's a subsidy if they move to a
 
04:05:31.710 --> 04:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
group one
 
04:05:34.110 --> 04:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
position then they'll lose it when they
 
04:05:35.710 --> 04:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
do retire assuming you know they're in
 
04:05:38.309 --> 04:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
group one when they retire however is it
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
the case that if they uh if this bill
 
04:05:43.469 --> 04:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
passes and they opt out of the
 
04:05:43.479 --> 04:05:44.630 align:start position:0%
passes and they opt out of the
retirement

04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
04:05:48.750 --> 04:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
system when they retire they would uh in
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
effect be retiring from group two and
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for that benefit
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
04:06:00.910 --> 04:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
you there's also of course the uh
 
04:06:06.189 --> 04:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
earlier retirement date on two I would
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
presume that after 31 years this person
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to retire from group two but
 
04:06:14.670 --> 04:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
probably not for group one is that
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
case I can't say what this individual
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
will do um you know if if if the law
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
passes and he takes the new position but
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
if he was eligible to retire in group
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
two you know you know has the age and
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
the the requisite service they they
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
could retire
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
um doesn't happen that often I mean
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of
 
04:06:40.189 --> 04:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
there's more exempt positions with the
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
state and certain agencies where you
 
04:06:44.590 --> 04:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
know we see that more somebody retires
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
in group two and moves into a a
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
membership optional position such as a
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner or Deputy Commissioner
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
things like
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
trainy uh Madam chair I just wanted to
 
04:07:05.870 --> 04:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and the committee for the
 
04:07:08.830 --> 04:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address and your for your
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
consideration of it and wanted to note
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
that it's always special to come before
 
04:07:16.590 --> 04:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
the house Edna committee because uh 44
 
04:07:21.070 --> 04:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
years ago I was a freshman on house Edna
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I served six wonderful years and
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
enjoyed every minute of it and I
 
04:07:28.349 --> 04:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
certainly have an appreciation for the
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
work you people do in that committee so
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'm sure the uh
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
question of the retirement system has
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
not changed in those years we heard we
 
04:07:40.590 --> 04:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
heard lots of uh bills regarding the
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
retirement system and I would have
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
thought by 44 years that uh everything
 
04:07:48.109 --> 04:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
would have been straightened out but it
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
there's always different nuances as uh
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
is demonstrated by this bill today but
 
04:07:53.359 --> 04:07:55.269 align:start position:0%
is demonstrated by this bill today but
thank

04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:07:58.510 --> 04:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay is there anyone else who
 
04:08:03.389 --> 04:08:03.399 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on this amendment to
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
141

04:08:09.030 --> 04:08:09.040 align:start position:0%

04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
right for motion ready for motion yes to
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
second second by
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
Schmidt Madam chair can I just ask that
 
04:08:55.950 --> 04:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
the people that are in the big room
 
04:08:58.269 --> 04:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
there if they try to speak right into
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
their microphones because it's loud but
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
it's not very clear I will say uh Sally
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
sorry representative fellows this is uh
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz I think it's
 
04:09:13.149 --> 04:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
actually that the sound volume to us
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
from the room is too
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
loud my understanding of um AV issues is
 
04:09:24.910 --> 04:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's distorted because how
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's coming across to those of us on
 
04:09:29.309 --> 04:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
Zoom is it's coming across too loudly
 
04:09:31.469 --> 04:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
and therefore somewhat
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
distorted all right thank you there is
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
some Distortion we all have to speak
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
more slowly and clearly than is often
 
04:09:44.790 --> 04:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.469 --> 04:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
um who was the
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
second it was Madam chair Peter Schmidt
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
you representative leus do you wish to
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion I do thank you uh
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair the uh basically what this
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
does is uh for
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
uh for the licenses that are fected so
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
aestheticians it
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
allows and currently they can uh do an
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um for their the
 
04:10:23.840 --> 04:10:25.349 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship um for their the
education

04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
required um this would value the
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship at the same level as um
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
you know going to a school it sets the
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
hours the
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
same and uh also
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the bill it currently
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
they can get an apprenticeship license
 
04:10:48.630 --> 04:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
um if they're going to a school or if
 
04:10:50.670 --> 04:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
they're in an apprenticeship
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
program um the minor change would allow
 
04:10:56.070 --> 04:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
them to get it you know even if they're
 
04:10:59.149 --> 04:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's Andor so they could do part of
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
their training I suppose in a school and
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
part in apprenticeship and
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
U and the other thing to realize is that
 
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
an existing la and what would continue
 
04:11:10.590 --> 04:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
is it has to be an apprenticeship
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
program that's approved by the
 
04:11:16.510 --> 04:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
board um or certain other bodies and
 
04:11:19.790 --> 04:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
they still have to to pass the exam
 
04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
so you know a good apprenticeship
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
program you know could be as good or in
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
some ways better than uh than going to a
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
school and uh you know we should leave
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
the option of doing either one of them
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I don't think it's
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
reason to be requiring twice as many
 
04:11:40.510 --> 04:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
hours in some cases for the
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship in a school thank you
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
repres uh actually Madame chair um I
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
misheard the bill number when
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative leus made his motion i i
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
i misheard it and thought we were I was
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
seconding the motion uh on the bill we
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
just the amendment we were just talking
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
about so I have no
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
comment actually I was I think I should
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion if that's permissible
 
04:12:10.199 --> 04:12:11.830 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion if that's permissible
because

04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:12:15.630 --> 04:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
um it was a result of the Mish
 
04:12:17.790 --> 04:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
hearing all right is there another
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
second then representative Bailey
 
04:12:22.590 --> 04:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
seconds do you wish to speak to your
 
04:12:22.600 --> 04:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
seconds do you wish to speak to your
second

04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
no so Madam chair are are we dealing
 
04:12:31.109 --> 04:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to this to
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
575 no not that I know oh just the bill
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
04:12:39.790 --> 04:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
not hearing everything correctly okay
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
because I didn't have an amendment so
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
that's fine the reason one everything's
 
04:12:46.349 --> 04:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
fine representative faran you wish to
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
speak um yes I guess this is a question
 
04:12:51.950 --> 04:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
for somebody on the committee who supp
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
the bill I was not at this hearing I'm
 
04:12:56.109 --> 04:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
just substituting for the day but I know
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
from past experience that the
 
04:13:02.189 --> 04:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists are they're very very
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
strong advocates for their own cause and
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
also licensing is something that we're
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
often uh
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're often attacking because it seems
 
04:13:11.630 --> 04:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
like at least to some members of
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
legislature I'm not ping anyone's
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
motives but it's commonly viewed by
 
04:13:18.030 --> 04:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
non-c cosmetologists as a profession
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's not really a profession whereas a
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
cosmetologist feel the opposite so my
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
question is um did the cosmetologists
 
04:13:27.550 --> 04:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
come out for the uh hearing like they
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
often do and also like who who at like
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
no theologist did not come out in in uh
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
force on this issue the only person who
 
04:13:42.670 --> 04:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
testified against it was the owner of a
 
04:13:42.680 --> 04:13:44.429 align:start position:0%
testified against it was the owner of a
beauty

04:13:44.429 --> 04:13:44.439 align:start position:0%
beauty
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
school okay
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
so okay great thanks so and what did the
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
owner the beauty school say about it or
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
they said that an hour of apprenticeship
 
04:14:00.030 --> 04:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
is not is only worth half as much as an
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
hour in the
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
school okay
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.550 --> 04:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%

04:14:27.550 --> 04:14:27.560 align:start position:0%

you wish to speak to your your motion
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative sh well I think we've
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
probably said most everything that
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
needed to be said U I will just
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
reiterate that uh this committee passed
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
this exact language uh last year by a
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
vote of
 
04:17:05.349 --> 04:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
16-2 uh the House of Representatives
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
felt it was um proper to pass it on the
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
consent calendar uh and
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Senate did not uh was
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
not able to take it up properly um I
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
will also point out that um we heard
 
04:17:22.880 --> 04:17:23.830 align:start position:0%
will also point out that um we heard
that

04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
the um bill would only involve at the
 
04:17:30.149 --> 04:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
most 10
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
individuals and it would be on an
 
04:17:34.349 --> 04:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
individual basis this would not go
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
forward for the position it would be
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
taken up each time an individual in this
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
position is
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
considered um and um there's one other
 
04:17:49.870 --> 04:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
say oh that that the um statute already
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
provides this uh same opportunity for
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Mr Carlin did note
 
04:18:04.349 --> 04:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
that there aren't very many
 
04:18:07.149 --> 04:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities even that take it out so
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
I doubt that it would uh actually affect
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
very many
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals and I would appeal to the
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to please
 
04:18:22.590 --> 04:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
consider maram County's position thatth
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is a very good employee and if
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
we're not able to accommodate him we may
 
04:18:32.429 --> 04:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
actually lose his
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
Services thank you Schmid do you wish to
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
I do Madam chair thank you very much so
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
I I think it's important for the
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee to know uh what people
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
with considerable experience uh in
 
04:18:53.910 --> 04:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
County government uh have learned uh as
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
a result of that experience and I have
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
served uh in straford County uh as the
 
04:19:03.790 --> 04:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
chair for multiple terms uh and I know
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
what a key employee the County
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
Administrator is is um we happen to be
 
04:19:11.070 --> 04:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
blessed in stford County with someone
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
who has served for um well my 20 years
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
in uh in County government and in Dover
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
City Council government uh and um when
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
you have a a key employee and the County
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
Administrator is the key employee uh in
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
the county uh who is an excellent
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
individual uh that you have the
 
04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
experience of uh you see that he or she
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
is uh compatible uh with the needs of
 
04:19:45.389 --> 04:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
the county the needs of the office uh
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
and also uh the personalities of the
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
commission that he or she serves um then
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh that relationship with
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
that employee is in the best interest of
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the county its citizens its taxpayers uh
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
and also all of its
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
employees uh so to the degree that may
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
county has such an individual um that
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
they've already had doing uh apparently
 
04:20:18.990 --> 04:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
multiple positions joint positions uh
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
for five or six years uh and someone who
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
had prior experience of the um the
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
county the corrections position as well
 
04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
this this means this person is
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily uh knowledgeable about
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
two of the the key ke positions in the
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
County government uh I can't emphasize
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
too strongly how important it is to
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
maintain such a person and and and that
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
person's reliability so I strongly urge
 
04:20:56.189 --> 04:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:58.950 --> 04:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
motion just one quick correction if I
 
04:21:01.630 --> 04:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
may Madam chair this this individual in
 
04:21:04.429 --> 04:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
marac county has only been doing this
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
job for u a bit over a year thank
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
you pearon thanks
 
04:21:17.710 --> 04:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
corre I do um I I think that this this I
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
know this is a complicated matter in the
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
sense that it's a it's a rewrite
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment um but this this is
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
a this is an Avenue for a for a county
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
to basically erase its debt to the
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
pension system and I don't like that at
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
all I think that there needs to be an
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to this I mean I'm not
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to the the idea of
 
04:21:44.910 --> 04:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
the 10 County U Chief
 
04:21:48.189 --> 04:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
Executives having the ability
 
04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
to but concern is the debt the debt the
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
prior debt that comes with that and I
 
04:21:55.950 --> 04:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
this this really should be addressed
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
here this is you know the the idea of
 
04:22:01.149 --> 04:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
repaying the unfunded liability is just
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
that repaying
 
04:22:05.790 --> 04:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
and I think there needs to be some
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
language added into this to ensure that
 
04:22:14.109 --> 04:22:14.119 align:start position:0%
that debt be taken care of in over a
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
period of time not not all at once that
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
could without having numbers in front of
 
04:22:20.349 --> 04:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
me I can I can see how that might be POS
 
04:22:22.109 --> 04:22:22.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
problematic but this is something that
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
is that is a substantial issue within
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
the pension system and the legislature
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
having having substantial pension
 
04:22:35.469 --> 04:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
liability and and I just I can't stomach
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
voting for something that allows a
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
county to just erase its the debt that
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's incurred over this so without
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
without an amendment to this to include
 
04:22:49.149 --> 04:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
the a way to deal with that I I can't I
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
can't go along with
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
fellows uh thank you madam chair just to
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
let you know my internet is a little
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
have my picture off um after list
 
04:23:09.109 --> 04:23:09.119 align:start position:0%
listening to all a testimony for this I
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
I don't support this amendment what I
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
would like to work on or see if we can
 
04:23:15.870 --> 04:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
do I with this bill or maybe it will
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
have to wait a while is to address the
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
situation that somebody could be um a
 
04:23:25.149 --> 04:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
long-term employee in group two and
 
04:23:29.070 --> 04:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
would lose those two key benefits the um
 
04:23:31.830 --> 04:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy and the in the
 
04:23:31.840 --> 04:23:33.349 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy and the in the
50%

04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
50%
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
um retirement payment to the spouse
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
just because they move into group one so
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I would you know I would like to
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
somehow um address excuse me address
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
that for the people who who are hired
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
prior to um 2012 in group two but not
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
make um this exception for the county
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
administrators I was one of the people
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
who voted against this two years ago
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
because I just think it's a slippery
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
slope I think everybody ought to be in
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
the um retirement system with the
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
exception of people who are appointed
 
04:24:18.990 --> 04:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
for a specific term like like the
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the state state
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioners those those sorts of
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
people thank you
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
04:24:28.640 --> 04:24:30.429 align:start position:0%
so representative
scitech

04:24:30.429 --> 04:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
scitech
 
04:24:33.790 --> 04:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's no good vote for me
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
in this thing um
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
the things that I don't like
 
04:24:40.990 --> 04:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
hearing are that he's been doing this
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
for a year there's nobody that good and
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid has made a case
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
that the man's Irreplaceable and the
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
more that's the lady do protest too much
 
04:24:53.309 --> 04:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
there's nobody that
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
good on the other
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
hand this when the municipalities were
 
04:25:03.309 --> 04:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
Exempted we did not think about the
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
UA and it just seems
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
wrong to be inconsistent with a job
 
04:25:13.149 --> 04:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
that's basically the
 
04:25:16.990 --> 04:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
same that would I I representative
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
fellows has on to something I am not
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to do the work to bring an
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment such that both the
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and this person as
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson says it's okay
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
that we exempt him but not from the Deb
 
04:25:39.070 --> 04:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
because the UN the debt that he would be
 
04:25:41.070 --> 04:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
paying or that the county would be
 
04:25:43.389 --> 04:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
paying is now a
 
04:25:47.710 --> 04:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
ghost and uh Marty Carlin pointed out
 
04:25:47.720 --> 04:25:48.469 align:start position:0%
ghost and uh Marty Carlin pointed out
it's

04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
0.00001 that's like saying a little
 
04:25:53.030 --> 04:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
adultery is okay but not too much
 
04:25:54.950 --> 04:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
adultery it's just
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
wrong so look I I'm I'm gonna vote for
 
04:26:01.229 --> 04:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
the darn thing I don't I don't like it I
 
04:26:04.590 --> 04:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
think that's the lesser of the evils and
 
04:26:06.870 --> 04:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
there I am
 
04:26:06.880 --> 04:26:07.950 align:start position:0%
there I am
representative

04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:26:11.109 --> 04:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
leus yeah I uh I'm twin as well I I
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
agree uh at least to some extent with uh
 
04:26:17.790 --> 04:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives Pearson and scitech um
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
I've got a problem with avoiding the
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
debt I mean I would actually
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
support um either here on a separate
 
04:26:27.630 --> 04:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
bill having municipalities so where they
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
have people move on or exempt um paying
 
04:26:32.910 --> 04:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
that debt although maybe since that's
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
been permitted back to the 70s that
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any sense I know um on
 
04:26:39.630 --> 04:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
just the issue of whether this
 
04:26:42.109 --> 04:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
person you know should be able to opt
 
04:26:44.109 --> 04:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
out of the system I I don't have a
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
problem with that in and of itself and I
 
04:26:49.590 --> 04:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
understand this situation you know why
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
he'd want to do it and and why U you
 
04:26:56.429 --> 04:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
know the county would want to let him do
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
it I also agree with the representative
 
04:27:02.790 --> 04:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
fellows that uh there does seem to be a
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
problem where if somebody's uh been
 
04:27:07.710 --> 04:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
group two long enough to be eligible for
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
certain benefits uh having them go away
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
just because they move you know maybe at
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
the end of their career to group one for
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
a while it doesn't seem right
 
04:27:16.000 --> 04:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
a while it doesn't seem right
either

04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure at this point uh I will
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
mention to representative leus that the
 
04:27:28.750 --> 04:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
the loss of benefits when moving from
 
04:27:31.469 --> 04:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
group two to group one at toward the end
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
of your career is a reason why we keep
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
getting requests by the prisons for
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
example to allow individuals who move up
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
into management to retain their group to
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
status it comes up every year but um
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
might there be another way to fix it
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
just to allow them if they've been in
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
group to long enough to keep certain
 
04:27:57.870 --> 04:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
benefits but maybe not the early
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
retirement I just wrote something that
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
would do that all right representative
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
Schulz thank you madam chair um I came
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
in today thinking I was going to vote
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
against this amendment I mean that the
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
whole uh debate about group one and
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
changing anybody from group one to group
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
two it's a difficulty it's certainly a
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
political lift but what sells me on
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
voting for it now is how close it is for
 
04:28:30.429 --> 04:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
counties to be uh in alignment with what
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
is already allowed to happen in
 
04:28:34.590 --> 04:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities it just seems like an
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
issue of fairness you know as to the
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
issue the bigger issue like the
 
04:28:42.070 --> 04:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
discussion around Corrections agents I I
 
04:28:46.109 --> 04:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
think you know giving folks a chance to
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
continue in public service jobs where
 
04:28:49.870 --> 04:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
they've had a lot of experience is a
 
04:28:53.349 --> 04:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
good idea but that's a bigger discussion
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh for today so to include just these
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
positions for the county I think just
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
seems to bring it in alignment and I I
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
happen to also know uh the specific
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
person we're talking about with maram
 
04:29:08.429 --> 04:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
County he actually is pretty phenomenal
 
04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
he's gotten some national attention for
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
some programs that he started in uh Mart
 
04:29:17.229 --> 04:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
County Corrections and he's actually
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
been a great administrator I wish I
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
didn't in a way because this shouldn't
 
04:29:24.269 --> 04:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
be personal right it should be something
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
we do without prejudice but just the
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
notion that municipalities already allow
 
04:29:34.030 --> 04:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
for this is um I think a good sign that
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
this is the right thing to do and to
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
encourage good managers in public
 
04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
service to continue on by not messing up
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
the group two status just seems like the
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
fair thing to do at this point for
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
whatever it's
 
04:29:47.640 --> 04:29:53.830 align:start position:0%
whatever it's
worth

04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
BR thank you madam chair my concern is
 
04:30:00.590 --> 04:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
the unfunded balance um it doesn't
 
04:30:02.189 --> 04:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
matter how small it is if we just
 
04:30:05.109 --> 04:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
continue to do this it's GNA continue to
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
be larger and larger unfunded balance I
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
would entertain a motion that would say
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
that if this was something that people
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
chose to do that the municipal I mean I
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't realize the
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities weren't also paying the
 
04:30:22.640 --> 04:30:24.469 align:start position:0%
municipalities weren't also paying the
unfunded

04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
bounds so um I would entertain an
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that would
 
04:30:31.760 --> 04:30:33.070 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that would
specify

04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
specify
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
that and I'd like to close the loophole
 
04:30:37.950 --> 04:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
on the municipality unfunded balance as
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
well representative laus I also was not
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
aware that the municipalities wer paying
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
u in that case um if uh somebody is uh
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
interested in doing an amendment to fix
 
04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
up some of the concerns um I would vote
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and you know
 
04:30:58.560 --> 04:30:59.710 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and you know
likely

04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
likely
 
04:31:02.429 --> 04:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
support uh you know support the idea of
 
04:31:05.229 --> 04:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
letting this person opt out as long as
 
04:31:07.229 --> 04:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
some of concerns or
 
04:31:11.109 --> 04:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
trust represent peon are you I am more
 
04:31:13.149 --> 04:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
than willing to I'm more than willing to
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
work with representative fellows to
 
04:31:18.269 --> 04:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
address um both of
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
those concerns in in uh and an amendment
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
to this absolutely we could do that in
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh post hastely represent SC uh I'm
 
04:31:33.870 --> 04:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
going to throw in the for representative
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
Schultz uh it can personal there are I'm
 
04:31:40.189 --> 04:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
willing to concede that the person has
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifications and it's really a
 
04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
bill of attainer it applies to him only
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
which is fine we we are here to make to
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
deliberate we're not a
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
machine but I don't I think this is a
 
04:31:59.309 --> 04:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
bigger picture than a than a simple
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment simple then an amendment for
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
the how you calculate the year a based
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
made what
 
04:32:12.189 --> 04:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
percentage and we got
 
04:32:15.109 --> 04:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
to involve the municipalities it should
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
be a comparable position in state
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
government municipal government should
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
be treated the same and I don't believe
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
when the lights go out that anybody's
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
going to have the gumption to actually
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
come forward with legislation I don't
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
think an amendment will do it we all go
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
home and have dinner and forget about it
 
04:32:38.590 --> 04:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's what's that's the
 
04:32:40.349 --> 04:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
political reality because there's no
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
crying need here this is a relatively
 
04:32:43.399 --> 04:32:45.950 align:start position:0%
crying need here this is a relatively
minor

04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
issue representative
 
04:32:51.070 --> 04:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you madam
 
04:32:51.080 --> 04:32:53.750 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you madam
chair

04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I've heard several times that this
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
is just affecting 10 people but not
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
that's not entirely accurate if
 
04:33:03.670 --> 04:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
everybody else in this system has to
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
pick up the cost of the unfunded
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
liability it's actually affecting quite
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
a few people and not just 10 I'm I'm
 
04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of new in town so I'm kind of
 
04:33:16.269 --> 04:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
horrified that you've allowed two cast
 
04:33:19.510 --> 04:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
systems to to develop where it's
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually worth not having five to 10
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
years of a pension in order to remain in
 
04:33:26.670 --> 04:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
the higher
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
cast I mean I I I'm dumbfounded by it um
 
04:33:34.510 --> 04:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think creating an exception for
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
one person
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
or 10 people when it's actually
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
offloading the cost to many many more
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
people is a legitimate solution to this
 
04:33:50.189 --> 04:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.199 --> 04:33:54.109 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
represo thank you madam chair I uh agree
 
04:33:59.629 --> 04:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
with representative fellows and I
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
certainly sympathize with the
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
County's uh desire to gra a really
 
04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
qualified person that kind of
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh for merit based hiring I
 
04:34:12.990 --> 04:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
think is really important I'm just
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
concern that this smacks too much of
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
legislation for one person I would like
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
to see us and the fairness issue was a
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
real one I would like to see us consider
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
this more either with an amendment if
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's possible or uh for it to be
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
retained so we can discuss it and U you
 
04:34:34.429 --> 04:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
know craft legislation that affects more
 
04:34:39.390 --> 04:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
directly uh thank thank you very much
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um I just wanted to comment
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding the history on group
 
04:34:50.349 --> 04:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
one and group two is that group two is a
 
04:34:52.269 --> 04:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
public service jobs that people retire
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
from early or like the firefighter
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
police officer because they're more
 
04:34:59.310 --> 04:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
physically demanding and that actually
 
04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
U and actually quite quite often they'll
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
enter quite often they're only halfway
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
really halfway through their career so
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing something of a less uh
 
04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:12.039 align:start position:0%
randing nature such as actually many uh
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
so some I didn't ask I should have asked
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
when they had it but there it's a there
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
are a substantial number of people who
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
leave group two earlier in the career or
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
mid after the standard 10 to 20 years
 
04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
and then go do other do other work
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
including sometimes group one work with
 
04:35:31.390 --> 04:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
different agencies in the in state
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
government and also of course this is a
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
symptom of a much more Global problem
 
04:35:39.390 --> 04:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
reti with our state retirement system is
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
that we've been steadily reducing the
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
number of younger people who are paying
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
into it by not uh by you know shrinking
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
the size of government which I mean
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
there's good reasons for that but that
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
does mean there Fe workers and also then
 
04:35:53.349 --> 04:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
shift more work you know contractors and
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
the stuff so we do have a situation
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
where it's bu to something there s like
 
04:35:59.189 --> 04:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
a pyramid here but we've been taking
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
we've been chipping away at the base of
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
the pyramid so it's a unfortunately it's
 
04:36:04.869 --> 04:36:04.879 align:start position:0%
in danger of collapse but I do think
 
04:36:06.510 --> 04:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
probably for this one case this is
 
04:36:08.590 --> 04:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
passing this bill is not a it's not a
 
04:36:10.670 --> 04:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
bad idea to deal with this one case
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
where one
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
individual uh appears to be the choice
 
04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
for a very important job and certainly
 
04:36:20.189 --> 04:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
so that's what it that's what it takes
 
04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem that's fine and
 
04:36:25.070 --> 04:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking legislature will be
 
04:36:27.310 --> 04:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this for many years to come
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
probably forever so
 
04:36:31.150 --> 04:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I wanted to say in
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:35.709 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment
thanks

04:36:35.709 --> 04:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:36:38.269 --> 04:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows um
 
04:36:40.029 --> 04:36:40.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I just wanted to
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
say I think I think we've got a couple
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
of things that we can work on and we can
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
come up with something but I'm not sure
 
04:36:48.390 --> 04:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
if we can do it just with an amendment
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
that it might be better to retain it so
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
we can get retirement to give us some
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
changes I have one comment I would like
 
04:37:09.150 --> 04:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm glad that we're we've
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
got some
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
meaty a very meaty amendment to replace
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
a bill that we really don't want to pass
 
04:37:17.470 --> 04:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
because it would need way too much work
 
04:37:17.480 --> 04:37:19.029 align:start position:0%
because it would need way too much work
to

04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
fix that is the original House Bill 141
 
04:37:22.480 --> 04:37:23.590 align:start position:0%
fix that is the original House Bill 141
which

04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%

04:37:34.000 --> 04:37:36.269 align:start position:0%
municipalities see repres

04:37:36.269 --> 04:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
04:37:39.150 --> 04:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
briefly U make a comment that well we
 
04:37:45.150 --> 04:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
talk about the unfunded aced liability
 
04:37:47.949 --> 04:37:47.959 align:start position:0%
on these positions um and looking to
 
04:37:51.510 --> 04:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
recoup it uh I think another question
 
04:37:53.629 --> 04:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
that may be asked
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
is um currently municipalities are
 
04:37:58.510 --> 04:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this that do
 
04:38:01.390 --> 04:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
they pay for the unfunded acred
 
04:38:03.510 --> 04:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
liability for that position if that
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
position was not in the system if that
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
individual prior was not in the
 
04:38:11.189 --> 04:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
retirement system but now has opted to
 
04:38:11.199 --> 04:38:12.590 align:start position:0%
retirement system but now has opted to
take

04:38:12.590 --> 04:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
benefits um I believe that they still
 
04:38:16.470 --> 04:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay the unfunded acrude
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
liability for that rate um so we're
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking you could you can't have
 
04:38:24.551 --> 04:38:24.561 align:start position:0%
it both ways where you accept it when a
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
new position comes in and you don't
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
accept it when they opt out um I I just
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if uh you could you would
 
04:38:35.230 --> 04:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
do that for the cities and towns
 
04:38:37.789 --> 04:38:37.799 align:start position:0%
currently and if not um you know it's
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion to be
 
04:38:43.470 --> 04:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
made thank you I believe
 
04:38:45.869 --> 04:38:45.879 align:start position:0%
that you're you're absolutely right that
 
04:38:48.789 --> 04:38:48.799 align:start position:0%
if we chose to amend this to require
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as counties to
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
pay the UA there would be a a major
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
scream of outrage because they've been
 
04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
UA U if if I may Madam chair yes sh yes
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the point that I was
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to make out um representative
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
Pearson is concerned about uh the
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
contributions to the U for 10 positions
 
04:39:21.480 --> 04:39:22.470 align:start position:0%
contributions to the U for 10 positions
but

04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:39:26.429 --> 04:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
currently um these exemptions exist for
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
all the municipalities in New Hampshire
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
which I believe right now number 240
 
04:39:32.561 --> 04:39:33.390 align:start position:0%
which I believe right now number 240
some

04:39:33.390 --> 04:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
odd and they
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
option uh so if if the concern is about
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
that and uh this committee wants to work
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
on an amendment to put that forward I
 
04:39:49.230 --> 04:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
would ask to please do that as a
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
separate issue because I'm sure we're
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to hear major push back from the
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the municipal
 
04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
Association against that idea because
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a major cost to them
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so please I would ask if you just
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
consider this particular bill which only
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
deals with the possibility of 10
 
04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
positions right now we only had the one
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
individual that the bill was put forward
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
for from Sullivan County last year and
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
now Marram county found themselves in
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
the situ this year so uh I don't think
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
there are too many people that would
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
but um I would just make the case that I
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't think this I doubt that if we
 
04:40:44.310 --> 04:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
amended it to
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
accommodate those ideas that this would
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
pass at
 
04:40:52.948 --> 04:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
all likely represent if I may follow up
 
04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
on representative shu's thing uh I don't
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
know that this is a major expense it's
 
04:41:00.270 --> 04:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a major insult we didn't
 
04:41:02.350 --> 04:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
give them their 5% so we're going to
 
04:41:05.430 --> 04:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
give going to stick them even more with
 
04:41:08.910 --> 04:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
this uh proposed legislation I think
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
that just has to wait for another
 
04:41:16.590 --> 04:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
environment not this one and uh
 
04:41:16.600 --> 04:41:18.230 align:start position:0%
environment not this one and uh
uh

04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
anyway representative fellows um yes I
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say I haven't heard
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
anybody tell us exactly how many
 
04:41:26.480 --> 04:41:28.310 align:start position:0%
anybody tell us exactly how many
Municipal

04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
administrators are exempt because the
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
ones I've seen one my town they move
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
from one town to another and I I'm
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
guessing that they're that they're that
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
they didn't that they are in the
 
04:41:43.110 --> 04:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system but I don't really
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
know how
 
04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
many some a lot of some of the town the
 
04:41:50.030 --> 04:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
real little towns they may have just a
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
part-time administrator so they wouldn't
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
be in it one way or the
 
04:41:57.390 --> 04:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
other Mr Carlin do you have any
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
information on that since you're still
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
with us I don't think he
 
04:42:08.788 --> 04:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.708 --> 04:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
name back
 
04:42:17.570 --> 04:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:17.580 --> 04:42:19.390 align:start position:0%

04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
call we need a Bild to Pro to license

04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
managers well actually more importantly
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
for the little towns the Town
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
Administrator m not be a full-time
 
04:42:40.190 --> 04:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
job right and in that case it wouldn't
 
04:42:40.200 --> 04:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
job right and in that case it wouldn't
be

04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.510 --> 04:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
eligible so is there any further
 
04:43:02.910 --> 04:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
discussion Madam chair I thank you well
 
04:43:09.070 --> 04:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
my concern is at what point does this
 
04:43:11.590 --> 04:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
end what's going to be the next
 
04:43:15.868 --> 04:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
thing that people want to be Exempted
 
04:43:19.628 --> 04:43:19.638 align:start position:0%
from from the retirement
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
system that's a very good question but I
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
will mention that we're currently seeing
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
a large wave of people that were hired
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
20 30 years ago coming into the age
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
where they're not interested in doing GR
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
group to work anymore and so we keep
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that the employers want to
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
promote them to management jobs and
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
issues I mean if you take a a group one
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
job when you when you've got 25 or 30
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
years into group two you're necessarily
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
delaying your retirement by probably 10
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:08.350 align:start position:0%
delaying your retirement by probably 10
years

04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:10.990 --> 04:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
right something that can be addressed
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
because I think everybody in many people
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
feel that they their group two benefits
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
should not be compromised because they
 
04:44:21.390 --> 04:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
have some group one service at the end
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
and when representative Gro when you and
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows make the omnus
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill here I'll be happy to support that
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
considerations well you know we excuse
 
04:44:36.990 --> 04:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
me um could we can't really talk about
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
are we yeah we could talk about this
 
04:44:40.830 --> 04:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
because we're executing this right yes
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
uh I understand the issues but at the
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
same time when you take the job you take
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the job and when you take the job take
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to switch jobs and you take
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
you take
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the packages that come with it I
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
just don't understand
 
04:45:10.480 --> 04:45:17.470 align:start position:0%
just don't understand
how

04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I just I I'm concerned about the
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
health of the retirement system and
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining it and I don't see how this
 
04:45:27.948 --> 04:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
is helpful in that respect that's my
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
concern and if we need to look at the
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
whole thing as a I know this is this is
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
a hair ball
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
a hairball of a problem but if we look
 
04:45:37.798 --> 04:45:38.948 align:start position:0%
a hairball of a problem but if we look
at

04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
it in that light then we may need
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
to look at it on a larger
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
scale sure nobody wants to hear on this
 
04:45:48.680 --> 04:45:51.190 align:start position:0%
scale sure nobody wants to hear on this
committee

04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.010 --> 04:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
but does anyone else have any uh
 
04:45:55.020 --> 04:45:57.070 align:start position:0%
but does anyone else have any uh

04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
fellows yes Madam chair can can you tell
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
me if he think it's feasible to address
 
04:46:14.030 --> 04:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
the issue of um moving from group two
 
04:46:16.830 --> 04:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
into group one and not losing the
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
benefits that you're be vested with Is
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
it feasible to try to just do this with
 
04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment in the next week or two
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
week how however much time we've got the
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
short answer representative fellows is
 
04:46:34.830 --> 04:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
no there's a lot involved and I'm
 
04:46:38.070 --> 04:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we could do a thorough job
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm fairly sure that a quick and
 
04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
dirty job would be very
 
04:46:47.788 --> 04:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
bad thank

04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%

04:50:32.070 --> 04:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes that's a very interesting
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
question can can you repeat the question
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
question was that if we retained the
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill would we also be retaining this
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.750 --> 04:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so I would say open the
 
04:50:50.760 --> 04:50:52.708 align:start position:0%
amendment so I would say open the
further

04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:50:55.350 --> 04:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay can I make a motion that
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
I see what we've got we sort have gotten
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves into a pickle here how about
 
04:51:01.390 --> 04:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
if I make a motion that we reconsider
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
the vote that we just took on the
 
04:51:03.120 --> 04:51:06.990 align:start position:0%
the vote that we just took on the
amendment

04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes you may do so and then we we um
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
retain the bill so you're withdrawing
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
your moot your Mo motion to retain and
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
Recons and moving to reconsider the
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
motion of on the amendment correct I I
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion to um
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
retain and I make a motion to reconsider
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
our vote on the amendment to house bill
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
Bill the nment house bill
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
575 M Madam chair I just point out that
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
you there is no motion for retain as
 
04:51:46.590 --> 04:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
amended I mean the committee doesn't
 
04:51:49.510 --> 04:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually adopt amendments we just
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
recommend that the house adopt
 
04:51:55.628 --> 04:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
amendments so if that's the
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
goal interesting situation where we
 
04:52:02.390 --> 04:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to pass the original Bill we
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
are we we kind of like the amendment but
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're we have many concerns that aren't
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
settled yet so we don't really want to
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
retain I don't believe we want to retain
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:52:16.750 --> 04:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
141 Mr
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
J I'm just I'm just here for the day so
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
but um I think the Full House the if we
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
we we could itl it and that would
 
04:52:28.910 --> 04:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
prevent us from considering a bill next
 
04:52:30.590 --> 04:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
year but that would only be a bill
 
04:52:33.190 --> 04:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
establishing a p registry and in fact we
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
could okay even asked have our rules
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
suspended so we could have a past
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
registry so the Full House hasn't taken
 
04:52:42.510 --> 04:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
any Vision one way or another on the
 
04:52:44.030 --> 04:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
Amendments there's nothing prevent
 
04:52:46.750 --> 04:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
someone from bringing in uh a similar
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
Bill even this year but certainly uh
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
next year to deal with the issue of a
 
04:52:55.590 --> 04:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
county administrators who who are been
 
04:52:58.110 --> 04:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
doing group two jobs so that that issue
 
04:53:01.030 --> 04:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
um that issue anybody could introduce a
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill during the filing periods
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact that this
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment failed the committee that's op
 
04:53:10.270 --> 04:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
that's the case then we itl the bill
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
here yeah to the floor with the intent
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
of killing him on the floor to when we
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
can handle that in committee but could
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee correct and bring a new
 
04:53:21.240 --> 04:53:23.110 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee correct and bring a new
non

04:53:23.110 --> 04:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
non
 
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment we can always bring in new
 
04:53:30.990 --> 04:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendments that's normally subcommittees
 
04:53:34.548 --> 04:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
do that so if we retain this bill
 
04:53:37.948 --> 04:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee could make and fix a
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
new non amendment to it and bring it
 
04:53:42.030 --> 04:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
back to us in
 
04:53:44.510 --> 04:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
the could we just stop the executive
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
session and leave it open to further
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh yes we could representative
 
04:53:51.548 --> 04:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
Le just a kind of a procedural question
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
I mean what would be the Practical
 
04:53:56.070 --> 04:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
difference between retaining this bill
 
04:53:58.548 --> 04:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
and planning on doing a new non- terine
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment and iing the bill and just
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:08.310 --> 04:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman if I could interject just
 
04:54:09.750 --> 04:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
to sort of piggyback on what
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative leus just said um there's
 
04:54:13.990 --> 04:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that stops you from
 
04:54:16.270 --> 04:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
establishing an ad hoc committee maybe
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
to work on the issue of you know
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
exempting ad chief administrative
 
04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
officers in
 
04:54:26.548 --> 04:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
counties um from retirement system and
 
04:54:29.390 --> 04:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
that ad hoc committee could easily
 
04:54:31.948 --> 04:54:31.958 align:start position:0%
develop a a new bill for the upcoming
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
session it might be a cleaner way of
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
posting in the calendar than continually
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
posting um House Bill 141 as it was
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
introduced Thank you
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
Pam that's exactly what I was going to
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that we we the committee can
 
04:54:52.948 --> 04:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
take up any issue we want to uh and we
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
clearly have not resolved the issue with
 
04:54:58.868 --> 04:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
regard to this Town Administrator County
 
04:55:01.868 --> 04:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
Administrator whatever situ situation
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
and uh so we can cheerfully the itl the
 
04:55:07.948 --> 04:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying bill which nobody
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
wants as far as I can tell and we can
 
04:55:13.830 --> 04:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
deal with this issue uh separately and
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
fall Madam chair if I may representative
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
sh yes I the one point I would say I
 
04:55:30.670 --> 04:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
think the committee felt that some of
 
04:55:36.510 --> 04:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
the issues in uh 141 did have Merit of
 
04:55:37.868 --> 04:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
forming of the
 
04:55:41.788 --> 04:55:41.798 align:start position:0%
registry um it was just some of the uh
 
04:55:44.910 --> 04:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
stipulations that were put forward in
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
that bill that were objected to if we
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
itl it I have fear that that might
 
04:55:54.190 --> 04:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
prevent that specific issue from coming
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
forward next year so I would say that we
 
04:56:01.470 --> 04:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
do need to put either retain 141 or put
 
04:56:03.948 --> 04:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
an amendment on it that um
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
releases that language so that it can be
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
brought forward next year thank you uh
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has volunteered
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
to come up with a second
 
04:56:20.350 --> 04:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
amendment a different non but related
 
04:56:23.070 --> 04:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
nerine amendment
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
that that we could consider so I think
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
we will uh recess the executive session
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
until next
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
Monday we are meeting again anyway so
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gro has
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh I withdrawn my motion and representa
 
04:56:50.190 --> 04:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
withdra okay so withdra we're we
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
have we have defeated the the amendment
 
04:56:58.750 --> 04:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
on various issues but we we think it's
 
04:57:00.548 --> 04:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
worthy of a little bit of work on the
 
04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
part of one of our members so we're
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
going to sign him that
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Excuse me yes s do we have
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
a motion did we do we have a motion to
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
reconsider on the floor at this
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
point that's the motion she withdrew I
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
believe yes that was the motion to
 
04:57:32.070 --> 04:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
retain then she ation made a motion to
 
04:57:34.830 --> 04:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
reconsider sub oh I okay I withdraw my
 
04:57:37.788 --> 04:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider thank you
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
represent excuse me yeah motion to adop
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment failed the all other
 
04:57:47.708 --> 04:57:47.718 align:start position:0%
motions have been withdrawn so we will
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
recess this executive session in hopes
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
of getting
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
a different yes if it's a non gerain
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment we're going to need a hearing
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
are we not I think it should be close
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
enough to this one Miss Marling that's a
 
04:58:04.680 --> 04:58:10.350 align:start position:0%
enough to this one Miss Marling that's a
good

04:58:10.350 --> 04:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.628 --> 04:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
question I would have to defer to the
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
clerk on that one I don't want to uh get
 
04:58:19.548 --> 04:58:19.558 align:start position:0%
out ahead of him well would you find out
 
04:58:24.190 --> 04:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
for sure because we have a uh we have
 
04:58:27.150 --> 04:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
noticed this main Amendment and we wish
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.120 --> 04:58:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
way

04:58:35.350 --> 04:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.390 --> 04:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
I'll call and and um hopefully get a
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
hold of him right now thank you we'll
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.230 --> 04:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
know I'm certainly willing to listen to
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
tweaking anything more than tweaking is
 
04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
worries me and I think the

firmly in the air we can adjourn for the
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
day I
 
04:59:28.510 --> 04:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
think I don't think we we have
 
04:59:30.548 --> 04:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
the we have
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
the looking for representative wer was
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
hoping to join us I haven't seen
 
04:59:36.400 --> 04:59:38.830 align:start position:0%
hoping to join us I haven't seen

04:59:38.830 --> 04:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
him can you repeat that Madam chair that
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
that came through very garage when we
 
04:59:47.868 --> 04:59:47.878 align:start position:0%
were when I sent out my draft amendment
 
04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
417 I got a question on the nature of
 
04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
involvement and I thought the best thing
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
to do would be to get some information
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
from someone who's been on fiscal
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative wer volunteered to join
 
05:00:07.470 --> 05:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
us and I've been looking for him but I
 
05:00:10.830 --> 05:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.840 --> 05:00:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
him

05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
him
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
so there is there's a phone call
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
somebody there's a telephone number in
 
05:00:19.280 --> 05:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
somebody there's a telephone number in
the

05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:23.788 --> 05:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
attendees all
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
right what's the last digit represent
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
there like the phone got on so let's
 
05:00:39.270 --> 05:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
just see here he is hello hello there
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
you are all right yeah I've spent 20
 
05:00:44.230 --> 05:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
minutes searching for the link that I
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
was supposed to get to this meeting and
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
I never found
 
05:00:50.190 --> 05:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
it I apologize
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
for not making it easy for that's all
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
right since you're doing us a
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
favor so
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes the reason I asked you to join us is
 
05:01:05.230 --> 05:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
that we have a number of the
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
emergency order the bills on affecting
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
emergency orders and states of
 
05:01:13.628 --> 05:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
emergency and we were concerned about
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
the role of the fiscal committee and
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
thought that you would be the best
 
05:01:20.868 --> 05:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
person to help us with
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
that well thank you um when the governor
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
first put in his emergency order last uh
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
last year and we expected to see
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
something at fiscal and and we did not
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
and supposedly we were told well that
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
it's not required and then it went to
 
05:01:45.390 --> 05:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
court because um Democrats in one of
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
them and and three others from the
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
Democrat leadership sued the governor
 
05:01:53.590 --> 05:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
and it went to court and the the court
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
decided in favor of the the governor so
 
05:01:58.750 --> 05:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
it kind of left it all up in the air
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
because I had read some of the emergency
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
things as well which said after so many
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
days he had to come to fiscal to get our
 
05:02:09.150 --> 05:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
approval so I wondered why what was
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
different about this and I never got a
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
good explanation so I sorry I can't help
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
you much but that was the only time that
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
we would have had an opportunity one
 
05:02:20.788 --> 05:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
would have thought and nothing came to
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
us well it did not
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
subsequently doesn't I'm I'm not a
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer but when I looked at the
 
05:02:33.788 --> 05:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
emergency statute not
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
um under I yeah under the department of
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
safety the emergency
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
orders there is note that says that the
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
F federal government or any federal
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
agency offers to the state Services
 
05:03:03.670 --> 05:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
equipment supplies material or fund
 
05:03:06.350 --> 05:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of Emergency Management
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
governor May accept such
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
offer and when I read the statute on the
 
05:03:18.160 --> 05:03:19.990 align:start position:0%
offer and when I read the statute on the
fiscal

05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee it says that if a grant or
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
whatever has been is required to be
 
05:03:31.230 --> 05:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and councel it has
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
to go through fiscal
 
05:03:36.470 --> 05:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
this didn't say governor and
 
05:03:39.868 --> 05:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
Council yeah so I suppose he could say
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
his executive power and I believe that's
 
05:03:45.150 --> 05:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
what he won the case on that it was
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
within his executive power although
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
normally if it if it's a big a transfer
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
it could be they would have to come to
 
05:03:57.430 --> 05:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal to get the approval of of the uh
 
05:04:01.430 --> 05:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
rece to receive the money and unusually
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
usually fiscal approves before it goes
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
to Governor counsel and then I had a
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
call from my counselor saying well we're
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
hearing this and it's coming to you next
 
05:04:11.990 --> 05:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
and I thought I thought we heard it
 
05:04:14.430 --> 05:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
first and I inquired into why we hadn't
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
heard it first and the excuse I got was
 
05:04:18.070 --> 05:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
well they meet twice a month and you
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
only meet once a month and I thought
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
what does that have to do with anything
 
05:04:24.310 --> 05:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you get some explanations
 
05:04:25.708 --> 05:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
that don't amount to anything and that
 
05:04:28.230 --> 05:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
was one okay but if
 
05:04:31.628 --> 05:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
I if I understand the role of the
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
council they accept gifts and
 
05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
grants or at least their uh their not
 
05:04:41.310 --> 05:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
their minutes are always full of gifts
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
of Grants and stuff
 
05:04:48.030 --> 05:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
does there's a a grant if it doesn't
 
05:04:50.910 --> 05:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
transfer um we yeah we we approve most
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
transfers and that's a big part of our
 
05:05:01.150 --> 05:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
of our agenda and and we also accept
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
grants and usually the grants do come to
 
05:05:05.548 --> 05:05:05.558 align:start position:0%
us first but it's part of their job plus
 
05:05:08.190 --> 05:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
they do contracts which we don't do and
 
05:05:09.948 --> 05:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
they approve appointments they approve
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
appointments which don't come to us you
 
05:05:15.948 --> 05:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
know promoting somebody to major in the
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the National Guard or appointing
 
05:05:20.430 --> 05:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
someone for a board the plumbers board
 
05:05:22.270 --> 05:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
that'll come through them but we never
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
see those things but normally the grants
 
05:05:26.310 --> 05:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
come through both of
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
them okay so that the normal procedures
 
05:05:32.190 --> 05:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
of a grant goes through both fiscal and
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
ex excutive
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
Council pretty much most of them
 
05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually go through both of them all
 
05:05:40.590 --> 05:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
right and how
 
05:05:44.750 --> 05:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh how responsive is
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
it well we we only we only meet once a
 
05:05:51.868 --> 05:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
month we have sometimes 40 50 items on
 
05:05:54.548 --> 05:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
the agenda uh sometimes fiscal has
 
05:05:56.788 --> 05:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
hundred and something on their agenda
 
05:05:58.350 --> 05:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
because of all the little appointments
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to look at we don't have
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
to so all those things are going on
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
continuously and so you know how
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
responsive you
 
05:06:11.590 --> 05:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
know I i' I've taken uh things late
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
requests to the to the agenda the same
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
day and and put them on the agenda but
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:06:21.948 --> 05:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
normally the agenda is made up a week or
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
so in advance and because I have to get
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
get it to everybody and the members so
 
05:06:27.670 --> 05:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
they can read what's what's coming and
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
look at the details and ask any
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
questions that they would like to have
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
beforehand so yeah responsive uh you
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
want to you want to have some heads up
 
05:06:39.548 --> 05:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
on what's coming but still the meeting
 
05:06:42.510 --> 05:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
is set like once when we meet the
 
05:06:44.548 --> 05:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
previous month we set the next month's
 
05:06:47.230 --> 05:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
meeting once in a while we've had
 
05:06:47.240 --> 05:06:48.230 align:start position:0%
meeting once in a while we've had
special

05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
special
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
meeting but normally it's not very
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
responsive if you got to if you just
 
05:06:54.670 --> 05:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
missed the last meeting and youve got to
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
wait a month till the next one so yeah
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
the meantime a lot of things can
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
happen all right well thank you that's
 
05:07:06.390 --> 05:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.390 --> 05:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
Goen thank you madam chair and as as I
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
look at this and thank you represent wer
 
05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
for joining
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
us my pleasure couple quick questions
 
05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I look at um when we talk about the
 
05:07:19.510 --> 05:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
emergency orders in the spending of
 
05:07:22.110 --> 05:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
gifts grants and Loans is
 
05:07:26.830 --> 05:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
under 21p Co and 43 and that just gives
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
the governor the ability to spend that
 
05:07:31.670 --> 05:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
we were talking about um represent wer
 
05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
would if be wise to include um the
 
05:07:39.390 --> 05:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
language it's in 124 colon 4 which deals
 
05:07:41.230 --> 05:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
with applications for an administrative
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
of Federal Aid uh the language that all
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
such monies in excess of $50,000 made
 
05:07:48.910 --> 05:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
available after designation by Governor
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
Council may be expended by the proper
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
persons or agencies in the state
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
government only with the prior approval
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
of the joint fiscal committee with that
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that is that are you suggesting
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
language representative go you would
 
05:08:03.708 --> 05:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
like to add would that be you think that
 
05:08:05.470 --> 05:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate that way there's a
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
check on the that way the governor does
 
05:08:09.310 --> 05:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
have to go before fiscal if it's more
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
than $50,000 being
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated in
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
Grants well if if this argument is I've
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
got to start on this
 
05:08:22.470 --> 05:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow then you know it's going to be
 
05:08:24.310 --> 05:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
a day or two before I can get the fiscal
 
05:08:25.830 --> 05:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee together and all that kind of
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
thing so there would be delays and it
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
could be as much as a month as I said so
 
05:08:33.708 --> 05:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
if if if lot talking about things that
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
need to be done immediately uh we got a
 
05:08:39.070 --> 05:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
hurricane tearing up the uh power lines
 
05:08:40.948 --> 05:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
we got something going wrong and and
 
05:08:42.350 --> 05:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
there are things he has to react
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
immediately and and the roads are close
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
so how do we get to concerete to have a
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
meeting you know this kind of thing um
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
so in the at the risk of slowing things
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
down how much do we want to tie people's
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
hands to react immediately to an
 
05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
emergency and that's what it comes down
 
05:09:06.350 --> 05:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
to I get and a followup if I may follow
 
05:09:08.430 --> 05:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
up but and when we're talking an
 
05:09:11.150 --> 05:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
emergency we we can to declare the state
 
05:09:14.150 --> 05:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
of emergency and I guess my question
 
05:09:17.948 --> 05:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
would be uh federal dollars and grants
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be coming in immediately we'd
 
05:09:23.548 --> 05:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
have to apply for a federal emergency so
 
05:09:26.430 --> 05:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
we would have time to work on that end
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
of it wouldn't we yeah quite often we go
 
05:09:33.190 --> 05:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
in and we've seen SE seen things come
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
through um fiscal that are two years old
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
like some of the snowstorms and some of
 
05:09:43.390 --> 05:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
the the floods we've had you you begin
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
working on it right away you use you use
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
your you know you use whatever you have
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
in your department to fix the road or or
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
stop the flood or whatever and then that
 
05:09:57.990 --> 05:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
becomes a soft match for the the Federal
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
grant which would say we'll take care of
 
05:10:02.510 --> 05:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
75% so what have you spent so fire and
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
you said well you we spent $30,000 to do
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
this this and this okay that's that's
 
05:10:09.990 --> 05:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
your soft match then they'll probably
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
give you three times that so yes you're
 
05:10:14.590 --> 05:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
right some sometimes you gota you got to
 
05:10:16.030 --> 05:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
react with whatever is available
 
05:10:18.910 --> 05:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
immediately and then the other the other
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
details of where the fun is coming from
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
and who's approved and what's it's
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
reviewed can come far later and and
 
05:10:26.310 --> 05:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
we've we've accepted things that were
 
05:10:27.868 --> 05:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
two years later because it took some of
 
05:10:30.628 --> 05:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
the towns and cities two years to figure
 
05:10:32.350 --> 05:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
out all the money they had spent on a
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
certain thing and and sometimes they
 
05:10:35.470 --> 05:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
borrowed stuff and then they went back
 
05:10:38.110 --> 05:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
and rep paid it and so that's yeah it it
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
took them a couple years to get the
 
05:10:39.320 --> 05:10:40.830 align:start position:0%
took them a couple years to get the
final

05:10:40.830 --> 05:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
final
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
accounting thank you
 
05:10:47.470 --> 05:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
repres thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
you representative wer for being here
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
with us
 
05:10:53.590 --> 05:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
today uh gener we're not talking about
 
05:10:55.470 --> 05:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
small dollars here and we're looking at
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
some sort of disaster issue or some sort
 
05:10:57.480 --> 05:10:58.708 align:start position:0%
some sort of disaster issue or some sort
of

05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
Declaration involving you know Federal
 
05:11:03.628 --> 05:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement would it be possible then
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
to to kind of meet Both Worlds here
 
05:11:09.390 --> 05:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps and say okay well that you know
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
instead of this being a $50,000 Mark
 
05:11:14.030 --> 05:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to some sort of disaster
 
05:11:16.548 --> 05:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
we could make that a $2 million Mark
 
05:11:18.030 --> 05:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
where it would allow the state
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
government to put some things in place
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
immediately and still deal with the fact
 
05:11:27.230 --> 05:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
that you know we when we're talking
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement at the federal level of
 
05:11:31.310 --> 05:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
substantial money that the the check of
 
05:11:33.470 --> 05:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
going to disc and all that could still
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
also occur at the same
 
05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
time well as I said sometimes it took
 
05:11:40.868 --> 05:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
two years to figure out exactly what did
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
what did you expend and get everything
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
together so if if you try to set a a
 
05:11:49.390 --> 05:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
level it would be hard to know when you
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
when you achieve that level you
 
05:11:52.230 --> 05:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
meanwhile you got people rushing around
 
05:11:54.510 --> 05:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
and got equipment borrowed from here and
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
there and people running to help you and
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
then later on somebody somebody had to
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
keep track of all this and that doesn't
 
05:12:02.590 --> 05:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
always happen so sometimes following it
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
up and making inquiries months later and
 
05:12:06.548 --> 05:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
say did you come into to this did you
 
05:12:09.788 --> 05:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
bring that did you do this and so it's
 
05:12:11.948 --> 05:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
it takes a long time to figure out well
 
05:12:13.990 --> 05:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
exactly how much did we spend on that
 
05:12:17.310 --> 05:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
thing the first 48 hours and most of the
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
people are still recovering and and
 
05:12:22.430 --> 05:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
looking for places to bring the stuff
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
and all this kind of thing so it it gets
 
05:12:25.948 --> 05:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
very difficult when you're in the midst
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
of something to figure out exactly how
 
05:12:29.910 --> 05:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
much you had unless you had a pretty
 
05:12:32.548 --> 05:12:32.558 align:start position:0%
good idea in some places that have
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
um and we've had funds come in lots of
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
times for disaster preparedness and the
 
05:12:39.390 --> 05:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be here's here's how
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
much we got here's here's where these
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
kits are stored here's what this costs
 
05:12:44.830 --> 05:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
here's what this costs here's what this
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
vehicle cost per hour blah blah blah you
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
had all those things ready that's the
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
idea of of disaster preparedness if you
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
know what it's going to cost if you know
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
what all you know to use this kit
 
05:12:58.070 --> 05:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and you have things in
 
05:13:00.430 --> 05:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
kits uh and you have sandbags that
 
05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to fill up and all this of
 
05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
think and you have a supply of them so
 
05:13:06.990 --> 05:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
if you if you know that stuff and you've
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
done a good job on disaster preparedness
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
you could come up probably within a week
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
of how much you really did expend but to
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
to set a a limit even if it's $10
 
05:13:22.590 --> 05:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
million if it's going on across a whole
 
05:13:24.510 --> 05:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
County you got to do a lot of
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
communication which people are not ready
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
to do in the middle of that so it's it's
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
a tough area no matter how you get into
 
05:13:33.230 --> 05:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:13:36.510 --> 05:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
wer I'm not very familiar with Emergency
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
Management do I understand correctly
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
that the main issue is that the federal
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
government requires matching funds and
 
05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have to document said matching
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
funds that is that is a big issue I was
 
05:13:52.750 --> 05:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
in Emergency Management in the Air Force
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
Reserve and yes they they wanted they
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
wanted everything to accounted for and
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
want to know exactly what happened now
 
05:14:00.868 --> 05:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
this if this equipment got destroyed or
 
05:14:03.190 --> 05:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
whatever and and that was one of the
 
05:14:04.948 --> 05:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
biggest things in Emergency Management
 
05:14:07.628 --> 05:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
in a state they you had to reach a
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
certain level before the feds would come
 
05:14:12.510 --> 05:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
in and so you had to some of the people
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh Emergency Management
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
were basically Bean counters and they're
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
just keeping track and as they're
 
05:14:20.190 --> 05:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
dispatching things they said okay call
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
this one call that one write this down
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
write that down somebody had to keep
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
track because when you went to this to
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
the feds they wanted to know exactly and
 
05:14:29.548 --> 05:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
I remember one time back when I was in
 
05:14:32.350 --> 05:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
the Air Force and reserve and they had a
 
05:14:35.430 --> 05:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
disaster in North Carolina and because
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the head of the Emergency
 
05:14:39.628 --> 05:14:39.638 align:start position:0%
Management was the wrong party when the
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
new governor got in he didn't replace
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
that person so when they had these
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
Coastal storms that tore everything up
 
05:14:48.350 --> 05:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
it was weeks before they even responded
 
05:14:51.030 --> 05:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
or even even know what they had because
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
they kind of destroyed Emergency
 
05:14:55.868 --> 05:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
Management and so it there were months
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
in recovery lot longer than they should
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
have been because they didn't have
 
05:15:01.150 --> 05:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
someone keeping track of all these
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
little noise that go on when you're
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
recovering from an emergency so and
 
05:15:08.548 --> 05:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
those people would also be the ones that
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
would be have assessments they'd have or
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
even been involved with a Civil Air
 
05:15:13.910 --> 05:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
Patrol If the weather wasn't too
 
05:15:16.548 --> 05:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
terrible to overfly and take pictures uh
 
05:15:18.110 --> 05:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
he had to coordinate with the Air Force
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
to get them so all these sorts of things
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
were going on um in in in an emergency
 
05:15:26.310 --> 05:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
and someone had to be reporting exactly
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
what happened exactly how much and and
 
05:15:30.670 --> 05:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
the way they started off and one lecture
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
I went to is okay if your roof Falls in
 
05:15:34.990 --> 05:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's your problem call your insurance
 
05:15:38.070 --> 05:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
company if every roof on your street
 
05:15:42.190 --> 05:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
gets ripped off by a downburst well call
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
the the city and see if they can help or
 
05:15:46.868 --> 05:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
if it's if it goes across the city line
 
05:15:48.750 --> 05:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
call the county see what they can do and
 
05:15:50.430 --> 05:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
you finally got to the state but if it's
 
05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
widespread enough and then they finally
 
05:15:53.910 --> 05:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
went to the feds if it was exceeded
 
05:15:56.990 --> 05:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
their capacity so there were a lot of
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
levels that I was involved in at various
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
times in in disaster clearness and and
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
how you would recover from it and there
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
was a lot of cleanup numbers that had to
 
05:16:09.230 --> 05:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
go into and somebody had to be
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for keeping track of all
 
05:16:13.150 --> 05:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
this and so you that's what Emergency
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
Management people were supposed to be
 
05:16:16.030 --> 05:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
do thank you there's a lot of Reliance
 
05:16:21.150 --> 05:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
on on having a good
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
organization I'm sure uh representative
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
goalie is familiar with a lot of
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
this yes representative BR you had a
 
05:16:33.110 --> 05:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you madam chair
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:16:38.110 --> 05:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
wer but we we know what
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
the um hurdles are in trying to assess
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
this and that could be taken into
 
05:16:49.150 --> 05:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
consideration is that right Ian we could
 
05:16:50.430 --> 05:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
take that into
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
consideration and asking for some
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
oversight so it's not something
 
05:16:56.958 --> 05:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
oversight so it's not something
that's

05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
unattainable no
 
05:17:05.948 --> 05:17:05.958 align:start position:0%
but whether that person is ready and has
 
05:17:08.910 --> 05:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
the likely uh figures and you know
 
05:17:10.548 --> 05:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's what we hope Emergency Management
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
would be ready to do and they would have
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe get up satellite
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
images and all this kind of thing that
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
to uh answer the call and see what what
 
05:17:21.390 --> 05:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
damages you had and maybe get them
 
05:17:23.670 --> 05:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
almost on real
 
05:17:26.590 --> 05:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
time and we' got a lot better capacity
 
05:17:28.548 --> 05:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
than we used to have for that
 
05:17:31.390 --> 05:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
so thankfully I'm thankful for that
 
05:17:40.628 --> 05:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:44.948 --> 05:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
much represent leus um thank you madam
 
05:17:47.470 --> 05:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
chair from what I heard it sounds like
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh the issue of a delay of a week or or
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
even maybe as much as a month in
 
05:17:57.430 --> 05:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
approving receiving let's say Federal
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
disaster money even in this Co
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
situation it wasn't likely that it would
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
be a huge problem because it would take
 
05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
some time to uh even figure out what
 
05:18:11.708 --> 05:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
you're spending and how
 
05:18:14.110 --> 05:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
much is that true
 
05:18:14.120 --> 05:18:18.350 align:start position:0%
much is that true
true

05:18:18.350 --> 05:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
than on
 
05:18:22.510 --> 05:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
valro thank you I'm sorry I think I
 
05:18:24.030 --> 05:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
might have lost the string of the
 
05:18:27.310 --> 05:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
conversation but um so this might be a
 
05:18:29.230 --> 05:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
naive question but if we're talking
 
05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
about being in the midst of an emergency
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
in my experience when there's an
 
05:18:36.750 --> 05:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
emergency everything gets dropped and so
 
05:18:38.628 --> 05:18:38.638 align:start position:0%
questions about whether it has to wait
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
two weeks or the next time the fiscal
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee meets is moved uh the governor
 
05:18:47.510 --> 05:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
can react and he can
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
communicate with his advisory team and
 
05:18:53.548 --> 05:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
staff and I'm I'm sorry I'm just a
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
little confused why can't the fiscal
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee come together and react to the
 
05:19:01.868 --> 05:19:01.878 align:start position:0%
emergency within a
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable period of time if I'm
 
05:19:07.750 --> 05:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
mistaken please forgive me
 
05:19:11.390 --> 05:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
um because I I think it's partly due to
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
its nature and partly because it's it
 
05:19:20.350 --> 05:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
sounds like its activities are
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
not the start of the process they're the
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
end of the process is what it sounds
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
like to me they're doing cleanup is that
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
correct representative wler yes what
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking talking about is the
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee will approve some
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
disaster uh assistance but at that point
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
the disaster is over by that time and
 
05:19:42.510 --> 05:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
and the people that are trying to figure
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
out exactly what it cost so until all
 
05:19:47.948 --> 05:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
that takes place you don't even need the
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee you know the the
 
05:19:52.030 --> 05:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
governor can grab whatever he has to he
 
05:19:53.670 --> 05:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
he can call up the National
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
Guard at his at his order without going
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
to the federal government and getting
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
them to pay for it he can ask them to
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
pay lat but he can he's got a lot of
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
Manpower he can put his finger on
 
05:20:06.910 --> 05:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
immediately whereas all this other stuff
 
05:20:09.628 --> 05:20:09.638 align:start position:0%
this is after the after the fact and
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
after the numbers are all in so it's not
 
05:20:15.070 --> 05:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
so much that the fiscal committee has to
 
05:20:18.190 --> 05:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
even be involved early on thank thank
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
you that's very very good to
 
05:20:24.910 --> 05:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
pleasure all right it's reached it's
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
reached our usual point of lack of
 
05:20:30.120 --> 05:20:34.070 align:start position:0%
reached our usual point of lack of
Interest

05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
we're fully informed fully informed ah
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yes all right I'm glad to get
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
in on this I didn't realize there was
 
05:20:42.590 --> 05:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to be an emergency management but
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
I got to use my eight years experience
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
in the Air Force Reserve for that so yes
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much information we appr
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative goalie no Madam chair I
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
just want
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
to ask the question one more time of
 
05:20:59.708 --> 05:20:59.718 align:start position:0%
Representative wer does he feel that
 
05:21:01.350 --> 05:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal should have somewhat the
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
oversight of how this money is spent or
 
05:21:05.310 --> 05:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
do he feel comfortable just letting the
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
governor spend it as he
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
feels I guess I would answer you that
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that the um
 
05:21:15.868 --> 05:21:15.878 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee needs to get involved
 
05:21:18.430 --> 05:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
unless it's a very longterm thing like
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
some of this pandemic stuff went over
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
months so yes at some point we should
 
05:21:26.510 --> 05:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
have some ability to meet but if it's if
 
05:21:28.430 --> 05:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's something that's taken care of
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
within a week or two or a month it's not
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
so important to get the fiscal committee
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
but if if the fiscal committee is going
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
to meet anyway then you ought to you
 
05:21:40.190 --> 05:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
ought to put it on the agenda so we can
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
all be involved because you know you
 
05:21:44.270 --> 05:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
hate to you hate to run off into a
 
05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:47.798 align:start position:0%
policymaking area without getting into
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
the policymaking branch of government
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
which is the legislature so if you're if
 
05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
you're just responding with a action
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
plan that's one thing but if you're
 
05:21:59.788 --> 05:21:59.798 align:start position:0%
trying to make new policy then
 
05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
definitely the legislature should be
 
05:22:04.270 --> 05:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
involved I think we can all agree to
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's where we draw the
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
line there's because when there's tens
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars coming in over a
 
05:22:14.628 --> 05:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
long period of time I feel you should
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
have a say fiscal should at least be re
 
05:22:20.350 --> 05:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
yes because because now it you you don't
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
have the excuse of it's it's an
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
emergency if it's going over a long
 
05:22:26.310 --> 05:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
period of time emergency was over pretty
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
early and and now it's all planning and
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
and preparation and carrying out a plan
 
05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
and there better be a plan so thank you
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know you know that you work with
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
plan yes we do all right representative
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
you got a question or
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
comment um yeah I just had one question
 
05:22:49.990 --> 05:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that some of the
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
federal money for emergency management
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
is prescribed so it's prescribed when
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
when we have the flood you know when
 
05:23:01.150 --> 05:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
you're getting the emergency Grant from
 
05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government you don't
 
05:23:06.030 --> 05:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
actually get the money you get a an
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
agreement to reimburse you for expenses
 
05:23:11.868 --> 05:23:11.878 align:start position:0%
up to a certain amount and you know what
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
those expenses are they're you know Road
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
repair and that kind of stuff in this
 
05:23:20.350 --> 05:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic situation we had some of the
 
05:23:23.070 --> 05:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
money was very different because it went
 
05:23:24.910 --> 05:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
state and the
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
governor was able to make decisions
 
05:23:33.390 --> 05:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
about about how to spend that money you
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
know he could you know he could allocate
 
05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
it for small businesses or he could
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
allocate it for nonprofits or you know I
 
05:23:43.470 --> 05:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the degree but he had a lot
 
05:23:47.868 --> 05:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
of discretion so it seems that those
 
05:23:51.910 --> 05:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
discretionary type situations are when
 
05:23:54.230 --> 05:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal should be involved you know you
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't you don't have to ask fiscal about
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the road repairs to
 
05:24:01.230 --> 05:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
the municipalities but there are and I
 
05:24:05.230 --> 05:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
just don't know what how do you describe
 
05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
those kinds of expenditures that should
 
05:24:11.070 --> 05:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.910 --> 05:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal well if it's a health emergency
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
there's a there's another whole section
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
of law under the uh Commissioner of
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services with her her
 
05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
Rea her right now it's a her her
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
reaction to to what took place and which
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
parts of Public Health and so on which
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
division she called out in public health
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
so there's a bunch of those things that
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
are already in in in the law saying how
 
05:24:40.750 --> 05:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
that person supposed to react so and and
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
when it's it's roads you got Department
 
05:24:45.070 --> 05:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
of Transportation when it's in the fire
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
department and police department get
 
05:24:48.910 --> 05:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
called out in every emergency like that
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
as well so all these different agencies
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
have plans for the various types of
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
things that go on and their their job is
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
to react immediately and someone has to
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
keep track of what they did so the
 
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
grants don't come in all that quickly
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
during the emergency but when they when
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's a long-term thing like a pandemic
 
05:25:10.430 --> 05:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
then you do have an opportunity to go
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature and go back to
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and and get some
 
05:25:16.948 --> 05:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
approval so that we're all on board and
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
we all know what's going on so thank you
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
as I say you
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
know it's it's the immediate reaction
 
05:25:28.030 --> 05:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
that you don't need the approval for you
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
better have a
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:33.948 align:start position:0%
better have a
plan

05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
you representative Wilder I do
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%

05:25:50.548 --> 05:25:50.558 align:start position:0%
right uh chairman Maguire glad to help
 
05:25:51.628 --> 05:25:51.638 align:start position:0%
hope I was
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
helpful we feel much better
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
informed thank you bye
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
now any
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:26:02.638 --> 05:26:08.190 align:start position:0%
other questions
comments

05:26:08.190 --> 05:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
oh you're brief um all this talk about
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
disaster reminds me that I wanted to
 
05:26:17.430 --> 05:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
talk to representative short we
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
factiously talked about a bill that we
 
05:26:23.070 --> 05:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
might sponsor honoring a or dishonoring
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
a certain Intrepid Explorer I presented
 
05:26:29.070 --> 05:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
that and tried to do some education at
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
my committee meeting and my reaction
 
05:26:34.030 --> 05:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
well let me describe it this way it was
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
kind of like run for your
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:48.270 --> 05:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:52.750 --> 05:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
itan if you will be very brief okay
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I won't say anything about HB 155
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
there there'll probably be some blur
 
05:27:00.830 --> 05:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
action on it um at the end of the day
 
05:27:02.750 --> 05:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
session in April I was going to say my
 
05:27:04.628 --> 05:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
perception just I don't know as much
 
05:27:06.070 --> 05:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
about as Rend Wilder did because I've
 
05:27:07.510 --> 05:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
never served on the fiscal committee
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
even on finance is that they were one of
 
05:27:13.030 --> 05:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
several bodies which uh had authority
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
over what to do with the pandemic
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
funding and were kind of shut out of the
 
05:27:18.510 --> 05:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
process I it also happened to Executive
 
05:27:20.990 --> 05:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
Council and even I think the legislature
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
we P one of the bill many bills that
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed was uh amended you know
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
after March 13th to deal with pandemic
 
05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
issues and I think part of the reason
 
05:27:32.670 --> 05:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
for that V was that uh it was out of our
 
05:27:34.190 --> 05:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because it was you know
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic money we were talking about so
 
05:27:38.708 --> 05:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
I I the government made a political
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
decision not to involve especially joint
 
05:27:43.390 --> 05:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal and the executive Council and U
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
he got away with it and I mean what he's
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
done has been fairly successful but
 
05:27:49.070 --> 05:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh it could have been done
 
05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
differently though and it probably
 
05:27:52.990 --> 05:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
should be done differently going forward
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:00.750 --> 05:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
side as for the Columbus Day um we'll
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
probably be hearing about in April but
 
05:28:07.030 --> 05:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:10.548 --> 05:28:10.558 align:start position:0%
you no one else has anything I think the
