00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Mr
 
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
chairman please allow me to give a
 
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
little background to this bill before us
 
00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
1573 you may remember the Scandal
 
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
regarding bledo a facility in Tennessee
 
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
where two New Hampshire Lads were
 
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
sent when Cassandra Sanchez child
 
00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
advocate went there for a visit she was
 
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
appalled and rightly so she decided
 
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
immediately something must be done to
 
00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 align:start position:0%
change the way we send people to
 
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
facilities and asked me to put in a
 
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 align:start position:0%
bill this was done on the Fly because
 
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsoring week was about to end so
 
00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
1573 is a
 
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
placeholder there are at least three
 
00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
groups that oversee children in need in
 
00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one is the office of the
 
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.910 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one is the office of the
child

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate two others reside within
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS one is children's Behavioral Health
 
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
the other one is
 
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
DCF I asked them to come up with one
 
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment which would be one of those
 
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
replace all amendments for the
 
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
placeholder I kept at them and while
 
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
they got closer and closer and closer to
 
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
unanimity squaring the circle great
 
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
rejoicing in the land
 
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
they could not ultimately come to
 
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
unanimity the sticking spot was how
 
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
exactly facilities were to Garner State
 
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
approval the office of the child
 
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
advocate has it one way they want such
 
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
facilities to be
 
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
0428 DHHS has another way of doing it
 
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
they want such facilities
 
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
certified that is-
 
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.350 align:start position:0%
certified that is-
0427

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
0427
 
00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
H when the committee researcher gets
 
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
here she should be armed with copies of
 
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
both of those if you don't somehow have
 
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.869 align:start position:0%
both of those if you don't somehow have
them

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
already the bill you may have read is
 
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
the placeholder You may wish to read
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendments 0428 and
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
0427 because these will be the ones put
 
00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.470 align:start position:0%
0427 because these will be the ones put
in

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
play the difference between the two
 
00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
amendments is mostly in the middle of
 
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
page on 428 it is starting at line 9 on
 
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
427 at line
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
copies in my
 
00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 align:start position:0%
opinion the amendment from
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS is is the superior
 
00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
one to come up with a formal
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
contract as the office of child advocate
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
would have us do is a good thing except
 
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
Contracting takes a lot of time and
 
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
effort the needs we have to make sure a
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
facility is up to standard can
 
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
adequately be addressed by the
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS amendment in my opinion without the
 
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
long time delay that that will need so
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
with that I put this bill into play Mr
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and am willing to take any
 
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any

what the office of the child advocate
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
uncovered this summer at bledo Youth
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
Academy I do know many on the committee
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
are familiar but I'm just going to
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
briefly touch on what occurred in July
 
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
during a site visit out of state so the
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate traveled to
 
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
Tennessee to Gallatin Tennessee for to
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
visit children in a facility called
 
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
bledo Youth Academy this facility is
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
certified by the state of New Hampshire
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
as a level three treatment facility we
 
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
went to visit youth there and during our
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
time visiting the facility which we
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
shared our report um that came out about
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
a month after our visit we found
 
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
horrifying conditions where New
 
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children were staying the
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
standards at this facility were not
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
standards that the state of New
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would agree to for our own
 
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
children they were degraded in this
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
facility they were physically harmed by
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
staff there were excessive restraint
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
techniques used at this facility as well
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
as encouraging youth to fight
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer in order to earn incentives
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
and be free from future harm from staff
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
and the facility what we learned from
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
these children is they were encouraged
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
by staff all the way up to the director
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
of this program to engage in Behavior
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
where they would either taunt or harass
 
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.150 align:start position:0%
where they would either taunt or harass
their

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
peers in order for them to feel safe in
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
the facility because they were told that
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
if they did this they would be protected
 
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
from future harm
 
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
the children were returned uh about a
 
00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 align:start position:0%
month after the oca's visit to this
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
facility in
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
Tennesse Upon Us seeing the conditions
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
in this facility meeting with leadership
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
meeting with the clinical team and
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
holding very high concerns for the
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
safety of our children we immediately
 
00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
called DHHS from the parking lot of the
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
facility before we were done our time
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
there it took an additional month for
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
these children to come back to New
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when once they returned to New
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we had an opportunity to meet
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
with them in residential facilities here
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
in state and have follow-up
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
conversations and check in with these
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
children to see if they felt safe now
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
and to learn more about what occurred
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
for them in that additional month time
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
frame what we learned from that
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
additional month time frame was
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrifying these children
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
were targeted by staff they were some
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
were pushed and um their items were
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
broken their personal items
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
they were told that they were going to
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
be sent to another facility and that
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
there was going to be further harm in
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
that facility they were told by staff
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
that they were gang affiliated and the
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
staff were going to send gang members
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
after them and their families
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
threatening to kill their families these
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
children lived in complete fear they
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
were so grateful to be back in New
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they are doing better now but
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
are still to this day struggling with
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
the aftermath of the trauma that they
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
suffered while at bledo Youth Academy
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
this is a facility that our State
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
Certified and our state entrusted to
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
care for our children and they were not
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
providing any type of care we know our
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
children that end up in residential
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
facilities already carry with them a
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
plethora of trauma whether it be what
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
occurred to them in their biological
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
family home the trauma of being removed
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
from those family settings and then
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
having to live in a setting with peers
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
who struggle with a lot of behaviors and
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
they're exposed to many things when
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're in these settings and so rather
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
than being able to send these children
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
to a facility where we could trust that
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
they were going to provide them not only
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
the treatment that they needed but
 
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
adequate care and Humane treatment our
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
children got otherwise so this is why we
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
sit here today and really urge the
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
committee to take a look at the process
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
of certifying facilities in New
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that enough are we
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
gathering enough information currently
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our children will be safe
 
00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
where they are being placed and the
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate feels strongly
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
that the certific certification process
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now is not doing that
 
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
Lissa is going to share with you um some
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
of our recommendations for amendments to
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
the bill to further strengthen this
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
process while also acknowledging that we
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
do understand the Contracting process
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
can take some time we do feel that our
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
children deserve what is best for them
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
and if it takes time to make that happen
 
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
then we need to take the time to
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
adequately assess them but we do also
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
understand that there may be times where
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
a child May be waiting in an emergency
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
department these are probably the most
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
calls we're getting dayto day currently
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
where children are waiting in emergency
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
departments for a a further placement
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
and so because of that in our in the
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
work that we did we did work in so that
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
they can be placed at a facility while
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
undergoing the Contracting process so
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't let go of the fact that we
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
need to do the further assessment but we
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
start with that initial certification
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
assessment and continue to assess the
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
program while the child is there until a
 
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.710 align:start position:0%
program while the child is there until a
contract

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
can be
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
completed thank you I just wanted to
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
touch very briefly on some of the
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
concerns and um we did hand out copies
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
of the bledo report the initial August
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
8th which delves into this issue a
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
little bit but in the months since then
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've learned even more so I just do
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that what we know is
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
that currently kids in care of the state
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
being placed by the state are being
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
harmed and under the current rules laws
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and procedures and
 
00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:01.959 align:start position:0%
the current bcbh system of certification
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
and oversight that's happening they're
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
being harmed so some of those gaps we
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
saw was you know how could New Hampshire
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
children have been placed at a facility
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee without bcbh ever visiting
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
that facility there were zero visits
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
before that facility was certified zero
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
visits to that facility before children
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
were placed there very vulnerable
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
traumatized children sent 2500 miles
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
away from home and zero visits during
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the certification recertification
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
process which happens every two years
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
and was actually happening during this
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
very time frame no visits from bcbh the
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
certifying agency until after we brought
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
the issues to their attention that means
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
no certification officer saw children
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
wearing colorcoded prison style
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
jumpsuits no one certifying this
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
facility saw children sleeping on
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
mattresses in the hallway because there
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
had been a flood that never got remedied
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
and no certification officer seeing the
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
barbed wire in 24-hour surveillance of
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
this children yet it got certified and
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
it got
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
recertified in addition one of the
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns we had was the lack of
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
restraint in seclusion reports a major
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
part of OCA oversight is reviewing
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion reports from all
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
facilities where New Hampshire children
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
are which are required to follow New
 
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law but bcbh had decided that
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
only contracted facilities should have
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
to send their restraint seclusion
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
reports to a central reporting location
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
which OCA had access to certified
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
facilities were not required to do that
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that was a choice that bcbh made and
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
continues to make so we continue to not
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
have access to restraint seclusion
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
reports for many facilities where New
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children are because they just
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
have chosen not to contract them now we
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
understand Contracting takes time but an
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
issue here is that this is a choice bcbh
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
is making there's plenty of certified
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
facilities that have been certified for
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
a lengthy period of time and they've
 
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.160 align:start position:0%
never even been asked to go through the
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
Contracting process might they say no if
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
asked maybe but we have no idea so
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's the current process that we go
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
through as you may know a contract is a
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
legally binding document certification
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
is not a contract can be enforced and
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the purpose of
 
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
Contracting is to lend a level of over s
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
it transparency and accountability that
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
goes through governor and council
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
certification is a purely internal
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
process controlled by administrative
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
rules that are only in the oversight of
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
the agency there is no external
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
oversight of the certification process
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
other than OCA so that's another
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of Contracting is it does lend
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
this external oversight and it's a
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
legally binding document and just one
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
more Point well to go with that under
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law any Services over
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
$10,000 are supposed to go through
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
governor and Council under mop
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
150 for some reason these facilities
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
that as we all know receive tens of
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars are Exempted from
 
00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
that process somehow but finally there's
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
been a recent Supreme Court decision
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that the court
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
itself said when looking at some dcyf
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
internal policies that the court doesn't
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
have to adhere to those not to policies
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
not to procedures and presumably not to
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules because what the
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
court said was we only look at the
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
statute the legislature has decided what
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
it wants the court to follow and they
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
have to put it into law otherwise the
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court doesn't have to follow it
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
so those are all concerns that we were
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
trying to address by that bill and as
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
much as it pains me to disagree with uh
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
your chairperson Pearson we strongly
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
disagree that the certification process
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
is adequate because we've seen that it's
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
not we've seen that BC cbh doesn't even
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
follow its current certification so I'm
 
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
not sure why them bulking up those
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
certification processes would make any
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
difference they are still internal only
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
with no external oversight so just to
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
take you quickly through the OCA
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'm sorry chair Pearson I
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
did not catch what the number of that
 
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.069 align:start position:0%
did not catch what the number of that
one

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
was the amendment is uh-
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
0428 H that's the o C A Amendment and
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
again it is largely the same we did work
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
very closely with DHHS to try and come
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
as close together as we could with
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
language and really with purpose we all
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
agree we want to protect our children we
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
just have a slight disagreement of what
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to take so um section one
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
is a statement of purpose we do believe
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
that is important that children have
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
rights and especially when they are in
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
state care the state has an obligation
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
to provide appropriate care we are
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
looking to sort of confine residential
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
plac replacement to ages 12 and over and
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
on short-term narrow circumstances only
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
there are some other bills in the
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
legislature this session around that
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
issue including
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
s417 uh section two of the original bill
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
was completely deleted because it
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually referenced um not a correct
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
statutory provision so that's gone
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
section two of our Amendment and I
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's it's consistent with the
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
DHHS Amendment just has some additional
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
language around the definitions and the
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring to make it internal
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
consistent uh section three is really
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
where a bulk of the differences lay as
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
stated already facilities have to be
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
properly licensed that's a separate
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
section of DHHS that does licensing all
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
instate facilities have to be licensed
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
foster homes are licensed Child Care is
 
00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
licensed separate process in addition
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
bcbh has that certification
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility and Contracting
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility for facilities they have
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
ch chosen to contract our Amendment and
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
what would be new to the law is OCA
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
feels very strongly it's important that
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
all facilities that children are placed
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
in particularly by the state whether
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
it's dcyf or bcbh should also be
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
contracted we did come up with some
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
compromised language as we stated that
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
they be contracted or be have at least
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
initiated the process of Contracting up
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
to 120 days obviously you all are policy
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
makers can decide if that's the
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of time we do
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
understand Contracting takes time I
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
understand the divisions um Contracting
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
Bureau has been recently increased last
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
year's budget governor and Council does
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
meet twice a month um it is a process
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
but it's not not doable um I would argue
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
that every vendor with the state is
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
actually required to be contracted we
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't do business with people who refuse
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
to sign a contract uh so but we did try
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
and build some wiggle room in there we
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
certainly do not want to leave children
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
without a place to go they should be
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
certified before a child is placed there
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
and it already says that we do have
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about the um following the
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
actual current certification process
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
that really needs to be bulked up eyes
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
have to be on they need to be doing more
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
than simply getting resumés and
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
brochures from facilities they really
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
need to go investigate and make sure
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's safe even under the current
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that's not being
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
done and we hope that it will be part of
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
that is by um creating a team within the
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
bureau this would require a little bit
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
more staff to really make sure that
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
certification process is being done
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
thoroughly that they're in-person visits
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
they're really looking at the program so
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh we'd also ask that that team create a
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedure form that
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
OCA would be involved when and just some
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the certification requirements are a
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific about what
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
they're looking at it would also require
 
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
enhanced monitoring visits currently
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to be visiting
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
contracted and certified facilities
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
every year one year for certification
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
one year for quality assurance as we
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
understand that wasn't happening anyway
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
we would like to see quarterly visits as
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
you all know there's a push to really
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
get kids out of residential care so
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
really hopefully this number is going to
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
be going down and down and down anyway
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime we want to make sure
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
that someone has their eyes on those
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
children who are in state care to make
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
sure the facility is the most effective
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
placement an appropriate placement the
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
least restrictive
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
placement I do want to add currently
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
just so it is very clear when we are
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
speaking about DHHS there are two
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
separate entities that are involved with
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
with these CH children typically we have
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the department for children youth and
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
families that is typically the placing
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
agency and we have the Bureau of
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health that is the
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
one that is certifying and overseeing
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
these facilities DCF policy stands that
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
they are required to go to these
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
facilities once a month to visit with
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
their children they need to see all
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
children on their case loads once a
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
month there was a case work worker out
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
there every single month in two bledo
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
between January and July when the OCA
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
went to visit not one of those DCF case
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
workers brought forth the concerns that
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
the OCA found when we went to this
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
facility so the certification team that
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be looking at the
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
physical facility the programming that
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
they offer and the treatment of the
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
children had not been out there the
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
worker that is responsible for checking
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
in with their child and ensuring that
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
their needs were met were out there the
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
problem is is that we need both those
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
DCF workers are not tasked with doing a
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
full facility site review that is not
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
their job when they're going out there
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
their job is strictly to check in with
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
their child are your needs being met
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
here are updates on your case I will see
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
you next month and we will touch Pace
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
before then and so there are people
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
going out there but not the people that
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
are responsible for holding these
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
facilities accountable and
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
accountability is key we do we are not
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
currently seeing much accountability at
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
all for these facilities I'll share with
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
you unfortunately we had to bring forth
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
at the last oversight commission for
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
children's services meeting that nationa
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
Children's Home had used illegal prone
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
restraint on children that was changed
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
in the law last year that continued that
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
occurred in January what is going to be
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
the accountability for this facility we
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
have not heard yet we do not have an
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
update that any action is taken to hold
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
them accountable for using illegal
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
restraints we need more accountability
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so that does have to come from that
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
separate entity but yes have there been
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
eyes on the children yes not the correct
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
eyes just want to make sure that piece
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
is clarified and that was a great segue
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
because the next section of the bill
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
section four would add two new sections
 
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.830 align:start position:0%
section four would add two new sections
to

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:51.789 --> 00:20:51.799 align:start position:0%
169f so 169 is the child serving section
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the statute 169b is Juvenile Justice
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
169 C is abuse and neglect act which is
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
where the rest of this bill would go
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
into or most of this bill 169 D is chins
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
which are children in need of services a
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
separate section so 169f is a underused
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
at this point but not if we have our say
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
because we would like to put stuff in
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
there it actually it is over the entire
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
family court division so applies to
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
judges with court ordered placement
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
under 169 B C D and court ordered
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
treatment episodes a treatment placement
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
that'd be bcbh so 169f is a catchall to
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
make sure all courts overseeing kids
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
that the state put somewhere would do
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
these things so the first section is
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
around those monthly visits that
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
Cassandra was just talking about which
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
are required and are being done right
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
now but sometimes can be as short as 15
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
minutes literally just putting their
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
eyes on the kid you look okay to me it
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
can often be a different person um
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
cassandre mentioned there had been seven
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
workers that was seven different workers
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
none of whom were actually the
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
children's case workers they didn't know
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
these people seven different strangers
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
coming to visit for 15 minutes in a
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
little conference room those kids did
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
not disclose anything to any of those
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
folks when the OCA showed up who did
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
have relationship with these kids
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
disclosures so it is important for
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
children when they're being visited to
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
actually know the person for the person
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
to know something about the child and
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
the family and the case so the new
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
section would require that the worker
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
visiting is either the child's actual
 
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
worker we understand that is not always
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
possible or at least someone that knows
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
something about the case could be that
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
person's supervisor a former worker the
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
assessment worker somebody that knows
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
something about that child and that case
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
and preferably the same person more than
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
once so the child can build some Rapport
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
we are also asking for that visit to be
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
bulked up a little bit not a whole site
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
visit like bcbh does but take a look
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
around at least look and see where the
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
kid's sleeping see where they're eating
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
if you go to a foster home a worker
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
would do that they go look at the kids'
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
room they talk to the other people in
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
the house look in the kitchen that's not
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
happening at residential facilities
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
which makes no sense because a child
 
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
who's living in a foster home has
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
teachers doctors counselors other people
 
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
that see that child if they were
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
concerns they could call raise the red
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
flag a residential facility that's the
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
only people that have their eyes on that
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
kid so to not check out the facility
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
means Nobody seeing is that kid sleeping
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
on a mattress in the hallway does is
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
their room stripped of all personal
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
belongings is there food in the kitchen
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
so just a little bit more of a visit it
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
does not have to be extensive also
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
checking in which is required but just a
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
little bit broader of we're checking
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
about the therapeutic culture we're
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
checking how the kids doing with their
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
therapist with the teacher things that
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
get done by every DCF worker
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
particularly a kid in a foster home but
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
seem to being missed a little bit
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
especially children far away that would
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
also develop a new form with OCA to make
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
sure that consistent recordkeeping is
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
happening so that the OCA oversight is
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually effective we can't effectively
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
oversee if we can't see what's happening
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
the last section is aimed at the court
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
oversight of residential placement which
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
is also essential to protecting these
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
children currently the court just gets
 
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
the information the division gives it's
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
not always thorough the court may not
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
know which placement is most effective
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
for a child they're really just taking
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
what the the division's giving them so
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
this section bulks up again in 169f so
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
that it does apply to children in
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice in chins in abuse and
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
neglect but really delves into what the
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
assessment has to say prior to placement
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure residential placement is
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate what review hearings look
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
like having them be more frequent what
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
um documentation is provided at that
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
review hearing both to the court as well
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
as to the parties to make sure these
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
children are not languishing in a
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
placement that's simply not appropriate
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
to them you know we are short on beds we
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
are short on placements but a child
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be sent especially thousands
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
of miles away and just left there you're
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
done we placed you we're not doing
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
anything else so this really builds up
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
the framework to let the court do their
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
job because you know we do have separate
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
branches for a reason Court oversight is
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
essential to protect these children as
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
well and then finally uh there's a new
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
section at the end um that got uh left
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
off of the original bill this is also
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
important reallocation of funds um
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
frankly in other states that have been
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
trying to bring their children home and
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
get the matter of residential placement
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
this has just been essential to making
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
this work reallocating any funds that
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
are recouped from not sending children
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
to these extremely expensive residential
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
placements and again this is taxpayer
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
money recouping it but keeping it within
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
the system it doesn't just go back into
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
General funds it needs to be then used
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
to bulk up the Community Based Services
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
because as we all know and the new dcy
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
director has talked about in order to
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
keep kids in their communities whether
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's their home kin fictive kin even
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
foster homes in their communities you
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
need those intensive wraparound services
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are safe so in
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
order to recapture that money that would
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
have gone to residential
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
placement in back into those community
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
services and if I didn't mention before
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
another big thing about Contracting is
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
simple fiscal responsibility as
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the blood sore report we
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of money putting these kids
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
in placements that are potentially
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
harming them and we are responsible to
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers in that process of
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
Contracting to have that executive
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
Council oversight which is what it was
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
created for is really important for
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility as well as the
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
safety of our
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
children I that was a lot of information
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
but we're here to answer questions as
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you we're open to questions
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you any questions um I
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
do have uh with with respect to um
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
contracts and certification in a
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
certification can you require that
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
certification to follow restraining laws
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
restraint laws in New Hampshire it can
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
our worry is the accountability piece
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
with a contract you have a legally
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
binding document and so if they're not
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
upholding that then there is the
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hold them accountable to
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
that we have believed all along that
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
whether certified or contracted all
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
residential reporting should come
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
centrally should be overseen that still
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
has not happened and that has been an
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
Ask of the office of the child advocate
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
from before I joined the office so I I
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
would guess from the Inception of the
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
office that has been an Ask okay and uh
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
follow up the the
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
um contract I would suspect you could
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
breach the contract however what are you
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
doing an emergency when you're breaching
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
a contract and you're pulling like the
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
two children that we pulled from bledo
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't that create more of an
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
emergency even even current Contracting
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
and certification process both and it's
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually within the bill as well there
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
are corrective action plans I mean
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
usually in any contract the first breach
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
is not immediate cancellation of that
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
contract you usually do a corrective
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
action plan that is built into the
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
statutes already but could be easier to
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
enforce with an actual contract as well
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
as you then have that Outside Agency
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
governor and councel that could be you
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
know pushing that there's not been
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
enough corrective action um but frankly
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
it's a problem now even with certified
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
and contracted facilities cassandre
 
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned NCH constant violations not
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
just of the contract but of children's
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
rights in abuse then is not nothing's
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
being done and part of that's licensing
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
it is a complex issue there are multiple
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
factors but absolutely it should be
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
enforcable but it doesn't necessarily
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
mean we're shutting you down could just
 
00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:55.799 align:start position:0%
be corrective action okay and with res
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
respect to the reallocation of money
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
monies that's at stfe for example the
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau of children Behavioral Health
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
that that funding will stay to them and
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the dcyf funding will stay with them or
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
does it go to
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS for reallocation the way in which
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
it is written it is Broad um for that
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
purpose I ideally in the conversations
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we've had with the agency which
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
they did not argue this point um is to
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
agree that if a child is coming from a
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
residential facility and requires more
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
intensive Services the funds that would
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
have been going into the residential
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
facility should follow that specific
 
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
child into their community services so
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
that could be a service that is better
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
fit for them that's offered through DCF
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
or it could be a community based service
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
through bcbh so that's why it's left
 
00:29:43.389 --> 00:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
more broadly so that DHHS can put the
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
funds wherever that specific child needs
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
them and we know the agency is working
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
really hard to to kind of break down
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
those silos you know we have meetings
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
monthly with Jeff and with Jeff and
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
katcha and bcbh and Christa and Marissa
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
that they're working really hard to make
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
sure that the children's system of care
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
the way it's being built out is
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
accessible obviously there are still
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
barriers there's still a lack of
 
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
services but we we have faith that they
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
they have that in mind that they want
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
services to be available and they will
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
get creative to make it work great any
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
further questions representative gibons
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um just to could
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
you provide context how how full as far
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
as um capacity are these residential
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
facilities so in other words if one was
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
to be shut down and the kids were moved
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
into different facilities would would
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
other facilities be able to absorb them
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
or or would we be in some type of crisis
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
with with where to place them we are we
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
are definitely in a placement crisis
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
already um and one of the major issues
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
is Staffing some of the facilities do
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to fill all of
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
their beds because they do not have
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
adequate Staffing right now um and so
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
this is where our children who are
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
higher need end up being sent out of
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
state because the programs in state have
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
more children to pick from and they may
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
pick a child who doesn't have aggressive
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
behaviors versus one that does and then
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
the one that does is the child that's
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
sent out of state uh but we also know
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
that there are many children lingering
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
in residential care that do not need
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
that level of care they should be in
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
foster homes they should be with fictive
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
kin and so that is our our constant push
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
on the agency as well is moving these
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
children along and in some of the
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
language in this bill assists with that
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
where it's really focusing on what
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
what is Residential Treatment it is a
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
shortterm episode of treatment to then
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
return to a community setting for
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
continued outpatient level treatment and
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
again it's not necessarily the goal of
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
us sorry I can't see you while speaking
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
theone of of either the OCA or the
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
agency or this bill to shut places down
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
yes bledo needed to be frankly they
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
haven't been shut down we're just not
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
sending children there anymore because
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
that was really a dangerous
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate placement but we hope that
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
this enhancement of um the review the
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
oversight the interaction will help
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
facilities raise their standards by
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
force if necessary to be appropriate for
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
our children we we do not want our
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
children in unsafe ineffective
 
00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:18.070 align:start position:0%
children in unsafe ineffective
inappropriate

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
placements um what what type of uh staff
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
are are overseeing these kids in these
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
facilities are they um like lnas are
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
they nurses like what type of do they
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
have their own licenses uh the the
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
Direct Care staff which are the ones
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
that work specifically with the children
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that do their evening
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
routine get them to bed um their their
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
regular schedule they are um not paid
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
very well um there's not high degree
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
requirements for that job um but we do
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
understand that the pay is really what
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
is losing a lot of folks in that field
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
because they are able to go to say a
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
fast food restaurant and make more money
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
there and have less stress than working
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
with kids with high needs um but it's
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
not a they're not highlevel positions to
 
00:33:07.629 --> 00:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
fill they do have clinical positions on
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
staff but they're not the ones that are
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
in the millu with the children they are
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
doing an hour a week of therapy maybe
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
two if they're doing an hour of family
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
therapy an hour of individual therapy um
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
so it's it is primarily those Direct
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
Care staff and so when we're going into
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
facilities and we're assessing and and
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
seeing a concern we're really focusing
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
on what education may they need because
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
they don't have high education
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
requirements to fulfill the job so what
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
trainings can be brought in to help the
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
staff lead more trauma informed
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
practices um what kind of Consultants
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
can come into the facility and and CH
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
and help shift the culture in the
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
overall facility so there's a lot of
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
work that can be done as Lisa mentioned
 
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
before getting to the point of um either
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
canceling a contract or decertifying a
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I have two
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
things things and the first one is I
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
wondered if you had any more copies of
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
the report because we are short five on
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
this end of the table um and the second
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
is regarding um training for staff who
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
will be doing these visits both through
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh the quarterly visits and the annual
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
unannounced but for the monthly visits
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
for the dcyf worker uh hopefully someone
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
who knows the child but even if it is
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
you know the rotating group of workers
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
that it has been what kind of um
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
training would become available because
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
if we now are mandating that they do
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
specific things which is in my opinion
 
00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:37.270 align:start position:0%
specific things which is in my opinion
entirely

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate is there a training that
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
will teach them how to notice these
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
signs so that these things don't fall
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
through the cracks again so one of the
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
reasons why um we added a form in
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
Creation with the OCA is to give them a
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
guide when they're out at these
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
facilities oftentimes there's there's so
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
much going on when you walk into a
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
residential facility and you're there on
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
a mission to see your child make sure
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're okay and then get to the next
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
visit because as you know the days are
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
so busy doing this work um and so the
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
form is really just the guide because
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
they already are trained to look for
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
these things when they're going through
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
the regular DCF training they they're
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
looking for them as Lisa mentioned in
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
foster homes they're are they already
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
have that I it's when there's so much in
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
front of them having that guy telling
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
them first you're going to go look at
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
the child's bedroom and you're going to
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
report what you saw in the bedroom then
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to sit down and talk with
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
the child and ask them about their
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
experience ask them about therapy ask
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
them about schooling right and and
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
giving them a guide for every topic to
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
discuss so that they're not missing
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
something should be the piece that ties
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
back into all of the training that they
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
already received and their initial
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
Social Work training and the additional
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
trainings that they are offered through
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
the agency and we would like to be a
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
part of that because we are doing those
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
site visits and that is something that
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS has been open to is to allowing us
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
one to work on things like a forum like
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
this or even to come in and present to
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
their staff how we operate in our site
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
visits thank you I I would just like to
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
add the workers at DCF I I worked at DCF
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know the folks at bcbh they are
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
well-trained folks a lot of them have a
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
lot of experience it's not that these
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
are all new things they're looking for
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
frankly this is really what they have
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
been or should have been looking for all
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
along but by spelling it out in statute
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
it makes it clear it makes it more
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
enforcable but these are the types of
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
things they would be looking for it
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
just hasn't been written in law that
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
this is what you need to you need to
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
take the time to look at the the room to
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
to see the environment so I don't know
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
that this is all new stuff like they
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been doing any of this but
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
because of what we saw at bledo we just
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
want to make it crystal clear in the law
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
that it is the policy and the law of the
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
state that they do this yeah follow up
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask it thanks um so
 
00:37:04.829 --> 00:37:04.839 align:start position:0%
regarding um are there any circumstances
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
where um we're finding that the workers
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
are being denied access to like the
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
rooms where the the children are staying
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm trying to recall I worked
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
for TCF years ago here in New York as
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
well and frequently when you visit a
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
child in a residential placement there's
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
like a visitation room right as opposed
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
to going to that that child's actual
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
bedroom where they're staying um have we
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
had any trouble with people accessing
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
those rooms and do we think that
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
spelling it out in statute would be
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
helpful we have not heard any
 
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
difficulties with accessing the room we
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
always ask to see where children stay um
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
and we've never been denied either they
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
have the same access to children as the
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
OCA would have and so there should not
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
be any denial of allowing them into
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
those into all different areas of the
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
facility thank you thank you
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and Miss Sanchez and it's
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
attorney Matthew Matthew M par me
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
attorney attorney massio uh specific to
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
um comments that you made that when uh
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
visits have been made to the subject
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
property as I'll call it that uh it was
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
found they were not following quote
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
rules when they're out of state what uh
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
sense or guarantee would we have they
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
would follow our rules when they're the
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
authority having
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so they do have their own
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
licensing entity and so our state
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
through the certification process is
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
required to touch base with their
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
licensing entity ensure that they do
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
have an active license in place um so
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
they do have that they also have their
 
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
own child welfare system who does the
 
00:38:47.069 --> 00:38:47.079 align:start position:0%
oversight if there's any concerns of
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect they're called into
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
their facility which was part of this
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
process we did call in abuse and neglect
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
to their child welfare agency so
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
although they have their own entities we
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
are the one that are placing the
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
children there our state of New
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is placing the children there
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is funding
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
the beds that those children are staying
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
in and so that this brings it back again
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
to the importance of a contract in a
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
contract you're saying you provide X Y
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
and Z service to our children we provide
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
you this funding and then if they're not
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
meeting the services that they they
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
agreed to pay for you're saying you're
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
not meeting the contract and we have an
 
00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
ability to hold you to that because we
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
have in writing that you're going to
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
provide this and we know you're not
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
but that is what the importance of more
 
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
regular in-person visits because it's
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult to be alerted of these
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
things when it is out of state and if
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
the state isn't there on a regular basis
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
are they truly catching them or is it
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to be a year later after they were
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
certified and they're going back out to
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
to see the facility so the quarterly
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
visits would also show a presence there
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
and we have heard from some residential
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
facilities I heard Vermont is one
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
actually that Vermont goes out monthly
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
with their folks that do the
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
certification process and so facilities
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
know when the state of Vermont is coming
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
and they know that they need to have
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
everything in order because they are
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to be there on a regular basis so
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
that presence is critical to hold them
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
accountable to what they're telling us
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide our children
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
and they folks that take New Hampshire
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
children whether it's Contracting or
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
certification are required to follow New
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law as it relates to those
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
children particularly 126 U which is in
 
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
the contract and in the certification
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
rules that they must follow our 126 U
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
because those are our kids paid for our
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
money but again there's been a lot of
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
instances as we discussed NCH even right
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that simply aren't
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
following the rules so it's that next
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
piece of accountability oversight and
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement of you're not following
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
those rules being able to get the
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
restraint seclusion reports to a
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
centralized area which is not currently
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
happening with certified facilities like
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
bledo would also have additional
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
oversight by bcbh CER certification by
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
the OCA so they are required to follow
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rules laws as it relates
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire children but it's
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not we catch them so that's
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
where the additional accountability is
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
required one followup Mr chairman
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
followup sure specific to uh attorney to
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
your comment just then uh on these bledo
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
being quote certified so-called if
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
they're not performing to the
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
certification and then we have our
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative or Representatives
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
visiting why are they not terminated
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
immediately since our children being
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
view that was I thank you Yan I'm not
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
the attorney but I will take that
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
question um that was a question that we
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
came back with that was our question is
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
if we saw something so egregious as this
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
why were the children not immediately
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
removed as an emergency and brought back
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
to Safety in New Hampshire it did not
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
occur swiftly it took a month to get the
 
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
children back it took at least an
 
00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
additional month month from the time the
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
children returned to desertify the
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
program and and that for us is too long
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
and too much of an opportunity for our
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
children to be In Harm's Way is 100% of
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
our uh clients out of bledo now yes and
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
they are officially decertified at this
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
time and during that period though there
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
there was another child being considered
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
to be sent there so it needs to be a
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
fast process because you know if the
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
left hand's not talking to the right
 
00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
hand but you know the contract ing piece
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
of that does give that extra level but
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always have to be
 
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
cancellation of contract that you know
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
in a contract you can build in
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
Provisions for oversight and you know
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement understood thank you Mr
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairman bet further questions uh
 
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.190 align:start position:0%
chairman bet further questions uh
representative

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
grman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
you to the office of child advocate for
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
all the work you do and for bringing
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
this forward um so we're talking about
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
outof State residential treatment right
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
now for our instate treatment are we
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
certifying or
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
Contracting so instate we have both so
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
all facilities are certified in state we
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
have a number of facilities that are
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
also contracted the priority of DHHS was
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
to First contract in state facilities
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
then to work in the New England region
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
so there are a number of facilities in
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts um possibly
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine as well that are also
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
contracted we have
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
asked how the order of preference was
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
determined what the next preference
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
would be for additional contracts and
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
have not been able to get a clear answer
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
on that question um but from when I
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
first joined the office and was learning
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
about the um Bureau of children's
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health process and the
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
Contracting that they were undergoing at
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
that time was told that the intention
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
was to continue to expand contracts to
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
more facilities over time we have not
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
seen that change occur yet follow up
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
is the Nasha a children's home
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
contracted or certified they are both
 
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.710 align:start position:0%
contracted or certified they are both
thank

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
you representive
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chair I'd like to go
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
back for a minute um and get some real
 
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
numbers here if if that if that's okay
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for taking my
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
question and all that you do thank you
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
um how many children on a regular basis
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
annually are uh placed out of state
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
approximate so those numbers have
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
reduced greatly since our blood cell
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
report and so we've been tracking them
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
very closely since that time frame y
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
they are I can I've brought my my recent
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
data Report with me
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
um and so we have so typically there's
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
around 300 to 350 children placed in
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
residential care
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
overall and um out of those primarily
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
they're in New
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently as of the the last
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
data point that we had there were 81 in
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
the New England region the New England
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
region has always been very high and
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
there are down to four nationally when
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
we first began looking at this issue
 
00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.670 align:start position:0%
we first began looking at this issue
there

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
were about 20 that were National and
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
there had been times in the past that
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
they were higher than that thank
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
you and how many facilities do we use on
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
a regular basis to place these children
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
in between New England bledo and
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
wherever else we have a large number of
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
facilities um that number is changing
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
because there's additional ones are
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
added and and um taken out quite
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
frequently my understanding is there
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
there are 44 that are contracted
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
facilities and there are approximately
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
additional 42 or so that are not and
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
those are out of state they are there
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
may be one or two that are in state but
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
they're primarily out of state okay one
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
more please sure thank you and how many
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
inspectors do we have employed in the
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for these
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
facilities I can't speak to the
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
licensing inspectors um but I can speak
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
to um the bcbh certification team and
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
currently that team is a team of
 
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
three and that we understand that is why
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
they're asking for additional positions
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
with this bill to be able to bulk up
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
that team for for travel purpos to how
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
many to how
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
many it has changed and they're here yes
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
I would I would Reserve that question
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
for them because I do believe we saw a
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
different number in the recent fiscal
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
sure one final final sure thank you I
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
know I said one more but I lied um have
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
have you a reason have you been given a
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
reason why it took a month to get those

office of the child advocate who you've
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
just heard from at length um um we have
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
been deeply involved in
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
collaboration for many months um as we
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
work together to strengthen the
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
residential treatment system and the
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health System of
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
care as a
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
whole the OCA deserves great credit for
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
their work bringing this issue to the
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
for and engaging with us as partners in
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
pursuit of our common goal to support
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
Youth and
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
families and I have to say I will pause
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things I've always
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
appreciated about representative Pearson
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
the the the um primary sponsor of this
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill is his ability to bring thoughtful
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
people together on issues of of common
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
ground and um one of the things that
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
struck me as I was listening to the
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
oca's testimony is how unfortunate it is
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
that when we agree on 99% of what is in
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
a bill like this that at times the
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
impression that we are conveying to you
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
all is that we are in disagreement that
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
there are lack of protections that we
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
don't trust one another that we don't
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
believe in the common goal that we hold
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
dear um that could not be more far from
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
the truth and the allegations and some
 
00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
of the falsehoods that were just made
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
around the lack of protections the harms
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
occurring to kids the nature of
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
Contracting the legal basis for
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
Contracting there's so much to unpack
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
there and to me it suggests that um I
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a tall task ahead of me in terms of
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
unpacking that for you all and and
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
actually correcting the record but also
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot more work to do to
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
help educate the office of the child
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
advocate in terms of how our system
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually works in terms of the
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
protections and how we are advancing
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
that common goal and so um I would just
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
urge you to to listen to what I have to
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
share recognizing that if you simply
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
listen to what was just shared you would
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
think that we're actually in opposition
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
to this bill when there could be nothing
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
further from the truth we at DHHS are
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
deeply grateful for the work of the OCA
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and all of you
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
for considering these important reforms
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is basically one uh technical
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
detail we want to urge you to reconsider
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of of best serving
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
the children of New Hampshire so I just
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
want to preface with that that um I hope
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
to take the high road here in terms of
 
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.109 align:start position:0%
to take the high road here in terms of
emphasizing

00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
emphasizing
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
collaboration my plan was not to
 
00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:49.789 align:start position:0%
collaboration my plan was not to
readjudication

00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
with the OCA and many other partners
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
across the state to get kids um from
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
that outlier program home safe but but
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
let's stick with this bill for the
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
moment and I can answer your questions
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
as they arise so essentially as I said
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
99% of this bill we completely agree
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
with we think that this is a step
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of our ability to keep
 
00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
kids safe when they do require this
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
level of episodic care in a specialized
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
residential program there is one thing
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
that we disagree with that in in the
 
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
Amendments as representative Pearson
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
introduced and essentially that one
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
thing is the requirement that all
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
residential programs be contracted and I
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
want to just carefully explain why
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
requiring contracts for all programs
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
will be a step backward for New
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Youth and the systems we're
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
building to serve
 
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
them so first Contracting is not what
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
ensures safety and quality in New
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire certification is how that is
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
achieved certification is what sets a
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
very high bar that has only grown higher
 
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
in recent months as we collabor collate
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
with the OCA with Advocates with uh many
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
legislators to strengthen our system and
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
ensure the accountability to keep kids
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
safe we have a robust certification and
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
licensing process um whether the program
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
is contracted or not so let me be clear
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
all programs must be certified whether
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
they are contracted or not so contracts
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
are really primarily a financial
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we use for the programs
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
we rely on the most so programs that are
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or in our neighboring
 
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.870 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or in our neighboring
states

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
are contracted there's 21 contracts um
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
we've been bring bringing forward uh a
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
number of uh enhancements to rates to
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
help ensure that the um availability the
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
access the quality of those programs is
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
as high as possible um Contracting takes
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of time it involves significant
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
negotiations um and so it's right for
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
the for the vast majority of programs
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what was lost in the
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
testimony you just heard for 99% and I'm
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
not exaggerating literally 99%
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
all but four kids current as of today um
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
served in our residential treatment
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
program they are in contracted programs
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire or in New England
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
um and so again we we this is the norm
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
what we are talking about is that
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
occasionally for 1% So currently
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
representing four
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
children from the state of New Hampshire
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
we have youth who have a very
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
specialized level of Need for which a
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
contracted program does not exist and if
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
a youth needs a program that does not
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
exist through contract we need to do
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
everything we can working with their
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
parents working with case workers who
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
serve them working with agencies to
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
engage in a nationwide search to find a
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
program that can serve them we utilize a
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
clinically based assessment Pro um
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
process that individualizes these
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
placement decisions and so I just want
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
to emphasize a very small number four
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
today out of roughly 400 who are being
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
served are we have to look for these
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
specialized programs and we leave no
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
Rock um
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
unturned I wish that New Hampshire and
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
our New England states could provide
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
this but the truth is some kids have
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
really special needs um and I'll give an
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
example um without again you know we
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
have just putting together kind of
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
common cases that I learn about let's
 
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
say that we have a a girl with reactive
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
attachment disorder it turns out that
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
rad reactive attachment disorder doesn't
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Provider doesn't have any
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
providers in New England or New
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire included that we can contract
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
with there are programs outside of our
 
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
region so for that young lady and for
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
her family and others who are
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
Desperately Seeking to get her that
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care we need to be able to
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate the occasional oneoff
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
programs and it's not like we just send
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
a girl like that to a program and say
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
good luck we engage in a deep and robust
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
process of certification again
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
certification is the key word here to
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
ensure her quality and safety
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
so I'll actually hold up there is a 48
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
page guide to all the requirements for
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
certification this is not a light
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
process is not a process we take lightly
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
um our program visits uh the program
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
initially we engage in an in-depth tour
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
we interview their clinical staff we
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
ensure per your thoughtful question that
 
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
they meet all of the requirements the
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
training the certification we complete
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
file reviews we so we randomly select
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
files to ensure that the quality of
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
treatment the therapeutic modalities
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
that are utilized are meeting our
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
expectations for the State of New
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we um analyze how they assess
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
Youth and engage in treatment planning
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
we review their daily notes we review
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
their clinical notes how they do
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
discharge incident reports um reports of
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh restraint and seclusion again for the
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
OCA to say that we are um you know sort
 
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
of willy-nilly sending kids into
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
programs that it could not be further
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
from the truth there's also an indeep
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
set of documents that we go through
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
looking to see if they are in good
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
standing with the state in which this
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
program is located so we look for other
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
um reports of what could be occurring
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
there we look to ensure that um they
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
have uh they're in compliance with all
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
the licensing requirements in their home
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
state and we don't just stop there we
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
also engage in annual visits um as well
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
as a combination of uh technical
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
assistance visits to help them improve
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
their performance um youth from DCF who
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
are the who are largely those who are
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
served out of the in these programs are
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
visited every month and again just to
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
correct the record these are not 15
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
minut minute visits where we pick up
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
some pamphlets as you just heard these
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
are in-depth visits we take them
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
extremely seriously we check on the
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
youth under our care we interview them
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
this is um this is we are we have a
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
critical responsibility serving often um
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the role of parents and in our um
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
obligations uh as a department and so it
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
um it gives me goosebumps to imagine the
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
notion that we would um do anything but
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
the most robust protections and beyond
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't even just do this initial
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
and these Milestone annual visits we
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
also have numerous protections should
 
00:56:59.029 --> 00:56:59.039 align:start position:0%
anything concerning arise in the
 
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
meantime so any concerns around
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
potential abuse or neglect we have an
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
entire special investigations unit
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
within dcyf who investigates
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
institutional abuse we have the we work
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Justice we work
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
with the office of the Ombudsman within
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS we have child care licensing we
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
have the Bureau for children's
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and under our
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
leadership in the commissioner's office
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
we engage these groups together to
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
identify kids who may be in a situation
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
where we need to take urgent action
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what happened with bledo
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
and once that case was risen we took
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
that action so safety requirements and
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
safety violations are all part of that
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
certification it's a robust it's not a
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
one-time process it's ongoing it ensures
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
that youth are safe um as it pertains to
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
the placement of Youth you know
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
contracts are largely a mechanism for
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
payment um to think that there's
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
something magical about
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
contracts the truth is contracts have to
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
be monitored they have to be enforced
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
guess who's responsible for doing that
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
not a third party DHHS so to think that
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's something about Contracting that
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
is advantageous is just simply untrue so
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize again that
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
certification is required of all
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
residential programs serving New
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth it is a high bar and
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
once they engage in this process it's
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
been considered so rigorous that some
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
providers decide that they don't even
 
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
want to be certified in which case we
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
would never send a youth to such a
 
00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.549 align:start position:0%
would never send a youth to such a
program

00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
no child would ever be sent to a program
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
that is not certified and this has
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with whether they are
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
contracted or not the second point I
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
want to make Beyond clarifying that this
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
is about certification and not the
 
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
financial mechanism of Contracting as
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
well as the point that this is 1% of the
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
youth that we're talking about is that
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
if we require contracts for that 1% of
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
cases we are going to actually cause
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
harm to youth so take for example a
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
child with a serious emotional
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
disturbance and a co-occurring
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
developmental disability or medical
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
fragility who whose issues and needs
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
have escalated and the family is at
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
their Wits End perhaps they're even
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
sitting in the windowless room of an
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
emergency department waiting as their
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
insurance company as case workers as our
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
DHHS teams search for the right program
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is what's happening if we have to
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
wait for governor and Council to meet
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
once a month that's an additional series
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
of weeks of waiting for that child with
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
specialized needs to get into the
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
program that he or she deserves we are
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
not looking to sidestep responsibilities
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
or legal um protections for anyone the
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to navigate
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
complicated bureaucratic processes to
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
get families what they need quickly I
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
believe we've distributed to you um a
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
flowchart that describes our Contracting
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
process if anyone would like to reform
 
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
our Contracting process you are more
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
than welcome um but let's just say New
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um uh has made it for good
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
reason very um complicated and long each
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
one of the steps in that flowchart takes
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
three to four weeks on average I won't
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
Bore You by going through every step it
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
requires reviews by the Attorney General
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
it requires reviews by the department of
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
administrative Services there's a reason
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
why in the Live Free or Die state things
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
move a little more slowly in government
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
and it's we have we have this entity
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
called governor and councel so there I'm
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
not I'm not complaining about the
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
process I'm just observing that if we
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
want to get that one % of kids into a
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
specialized placement we cannot rely
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
upon this bureaucratically heavy slow
 
01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
system or we are going to have kids
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
languishing in the wrong places um a
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
soul Source contract which is what we're
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
talking about would take on average
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
about 120 days to complete so that's 120
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
days an unacceptable amount of time for
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
a child to be waiting and waiting when
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
they are in crisis and so we need that
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility and efficiency to occasion
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
Al engage in a process to get that kid
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
into the most appropriate level of care
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
and then ensure all those enforcement
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
and protection mechanisms that I went
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
through before are in place to ensure
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
that their safety and well-being is
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
always the priority I also want to
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
mention that if we were to require
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
Contracting for that additional 1% since
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
we already have it for the 99% it could
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
really negatively impact other parts of
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
our system so for example right now if a
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
child needed our highest level of care
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
level which is a psychiatric Residential
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility but they're currently
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
in a level three um that is basically
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to create an issue of
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
bottlenecking in the system where they
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
can't move because they can't get uh
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
space um due to the child who's waiting
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
for their SE it so essentially you're
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
not just impacting that one child who's
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
going to be sitting in an emergency
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
department or in another desperate
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
situation waiting to get into care
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
you're also bottlenecking the entire
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
process for youth who may need to move
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
between levels as their therapeutic
 
01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.390 align:start position:0%
between levels as their therapeutic
needs

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
change um and so again I just want to
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
say that we recognize what the OCA is
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do we agree with
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
9999 you know probably 99.9% of it as
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
reflected in this very thoughtful bill
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
they have helped Craft um simply having
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
to go through governor and counsel and a
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
Contracting process does not add value
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
here it will do harm um and to think
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
that contracts offer something magical
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
or that certific the claim that
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
certification is not legally binding is
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
completely untrue the courts have that
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
um rules and the process of
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
certification very much is legally
 
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
binding and so this could really have
 
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
harms to our youth and and again I'll
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
just close by saying that you know I
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
began by saying that we want to be
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative here we want to be open we
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
want to be transparent we want to avoid
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
kids needing Residential Care whenever
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
possible keep them in a homelike setting
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
wrap supports around their families
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
around their communities to keep them
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
well and to keep them thriving in those
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
rare times that a youth needs
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
residential treatment we need to ensure
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
that those programs are top quality that
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're meeting New Hampshire's high
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
standards and that there are Protections
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
in place so that if something is
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
occurring that should not that we ensure
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
those kids are moved to a more
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate and safe location we are
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
committed to working with the OCA
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
actively to move this work forward if we
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
require Contracting for every certified
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
program again this would affect four out
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
of 400 kids um it is going to be a major
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
step back it's going to add time it's
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to add
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy um and and frankly just as
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
Lisa said we want to avoid having kids
 
01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:35.559 align:start position:0%
languishing in inappropriate care we
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
could not agree more that's the very
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
reason why we ask you to advance the
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
amendment in which we have asked for the
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility for this very small number
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
of Youth to be able to serve them to
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
reassure their families we can get them
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
care in an appropriate place and that we
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
will keep them safe um we believe that
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
our amendments supports that mission um
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
thanks so much for the opportunity to
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
provide feedback and both myself and our
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
um team are happy to answer any
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
questions great any questions
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
representative p uh
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so my
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
question is on the process of
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
Contracting so the amendment offered by
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate asks on
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
page two line 13 and 14 it says um and
 
01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
contracted by the department or at least
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
have initiated the process of
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting to be completed as
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
expediently as possible so as I'm
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
reading that not being an attorney it
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like if there is a child
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
who needs for example a level five
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
placement that a child could be placed
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
there as long as we have initiated the
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
Contracting process with that placement
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
is that am I misreading that because it
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like the child could be
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
placed there while the contract is being
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
negotiated yeah let me I'm going to call
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
up um Rebecca Ross who's an attorney by
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
training and also the director of the uh
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau for children's Behavioral Health
 
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
to to answer that thoughtful question
 
01:05:04.039 --> 01:05:10.910 align:start position:0%
to to answer that thoughtful question
thank

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
you morning for the record Rebecca Ross
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
the director of The Bureau for
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health if I
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
understand your question correctly um
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
you're asking if the bill represents
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
that all we would have to do is begin
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
the contract ing process in order to
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
place a youth is that
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
correct yes my question is would so that
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
there would not necessarily be that
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
bottleneck um but then I guess my the to
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
further the question is um you now have
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
six months to get that Contracting
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
process banged out before you have to
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
make a decision on whether or not um the
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
contract is not going to happen in a
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
different placement would have to happen
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
right so the problem with that process
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
is that the purpose of the contract is
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting of the Mind on what
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to provide and what we are
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
going to pay um if they start performing
 
01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
under that contract they will be
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
expecting payment if GNC has to approve
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
it GNC May disagree and then New
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the position where
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
another provider has detrimentally
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
relied Upon Our representation that we
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
would contract with them um the decision
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
makers have chosen not to and we still
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
owe them the money so in order to be in
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
a place where we have a binding contract
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
that represents what we're actually
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
agreeing to we need to do that before
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're providing the service
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
um this sets up a framework where we're
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
constantly in the place that we have to
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
agree to whatever terms that a provider
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
is um offering because we have to enter
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
a contract because they're already
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
may thank you so under because this is
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
the Crux of the difference between both
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
of your bills because you both require
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
you know um extensive visits and and
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
follow-ups and and I I love that about
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
both of them so for your bill in that
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
same situation we have a child who needs
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
a higher level placement you would place
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
them with the certific under a
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
certification process right without
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
doing a contract Would we not still be
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
required to pay for the service and I
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
mean I guess my question is what's
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
the what's the the difference to the
 
01:07:22.589 --> 01:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
child that we're talking about between
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
creating a contract that could maybe be
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
used for other children or not creating
 
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
a contract like what's the difference
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
for the service provision and our
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that the kid is
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
getting appropriate services in a safe
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
way practically speaking for a single
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
individual going to an out ofate
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
provider none um the history behind the
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
contracts more relates to systemwide
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
change and transformation to create a
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
network of providers that meet all of
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's youth's needs but for a
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
single child if we're certifying a
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
program we're taking them as they are at
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
that time agreeing they're able to
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
provide the service for that youth um
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
and doing it under our certified rules
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and paying an established rate okay
 
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome for the
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative in
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
van thank you Mr chairman uh for M M
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
Ross or director Ross either works want
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
want to address you correctly um
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
specific uh
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
to what was uh offered by your colleague
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
next to you is that we a certification
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh process not process certification uh
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
for qualification to provide services to
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
our youth one and then once we have that
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
certification for the
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
purposes delineated that are provided at
 
01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.870 align:start position:0%
purposes delineated that are provided at
that

01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
Source a contract would be for a
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
specialized application within those
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
Services would that be a correct
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the
process

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm completely following
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes a contract would be above and beyond
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
any of the certification requirements so
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
the contracts require that they are
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
licensed within their own jurisdiction
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
certified for payment by bcbh comply
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
with the Medicaid rules and
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
certification standards and then a
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
contract would be on top of
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
that followup Mr chairman followup sure
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh and and in the uh
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
interest of the timing for the services
 
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
as stated by you ladies in the critical
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
mass we're dealing with and that get we
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to get it done while we're young
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
here and when we're doing it is um if
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
the certifications are being met there
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a wording here I think is wrong
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
it says but a no less than 120 days we
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
want no more than 120 days I would think
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of um signing a contract for
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
specific services and would that meet
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
the the uh I trying to read these
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendments as fast as possible here is
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
that what you're not that would you be
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
in agreement with that that it would be
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
120 days or less for any special
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
application to meet this the service
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
required by our New Hampshire youth well
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's the oca's proposal so I
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
would let them speak to what their
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
intent was but we believe the
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
certification process meets that need
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
and we would not be proposing to do it
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
within that 120
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
days um Mr chairman follow up sure when
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
you said would not you would not do it
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
within 120
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
days is that what you just said I we're
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
not proposing to do it within any time
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
frame because we believe the
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
certification process is sufficient for
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
the programs that we're using for single
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
youth um but the OCA would be the best
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
party to speak to their intent with that
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
120 days and just to get you one more
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
time Mr chairman please sure uh
 
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
therefore then the contract would be
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
moot in terms of application
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the process whereas the certification
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
has already set the
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
standard correct thank you thank you
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairman
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for being here
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
and explaining the situation and taking
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
the questions how many facilities are
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
you placing children with at this
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
current time that you're not that do not
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a contract with
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
you so we have a little over 44 programs
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
that are contracted some of those are um
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
provided by the same entity so we have
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
less contracts than we have programs
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
because they provide different Services
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
we have a little under 100 um certified
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
providers so roughly half um but as
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner hen stated the
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the youth we're serving are
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
in our contracted programs we do have um
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
four youth that are outside of New
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
England in non-contracted
 
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
programs and then another
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
um handful or so that are in New England
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
programs that do not have contracts
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
because when we started the Contracting
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
process we went out to bid um and we
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
entered into contracts with the
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
individuals that put bids in that wanted
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
to do business with us um when those
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the needs we continue to use
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
some of our other regular Partners to
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the remainder of the
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
youth okay
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
follow yes thank you now it's a actually
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a separate question but you
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
outlined like how careful you are and
 
01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
that you have this process where people
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
go check and you know that that you you
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
know you have more than a 15 M minute
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
visit I that doesn't explain bledo to me
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
if you have all of these safeguards and
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
you have all of these things that you're
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
happen so again I think the purpose of
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
this hearing today is is not necessarily
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
A's concerns extremely seriously we'd
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
seen the youth just a couple weeks
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
before um had not observed the same
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
conditions the youth did not report them
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
to us in the same way that um they were
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
observed and so we immediately initiated
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
an investigation and I want to emphasize
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
that um well to an outsider it may sound
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
like three or four weeks is a long time
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
um part of what we were trying to do is
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
the whole reason again these youth were
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
out of the region is because there
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
weren't services that met their needs
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
here in New England a transition to a
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
new program is in inherently traumatic
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
in and of itself for youth who have been
 
01:13:27.629 --> 01:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
shuttled between programs and Foster
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
homes perhaps for their entire lives and
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
so we needed to make sure that we had a
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
safe place for them to return to and
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
balance the risks as we worked with
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
Tennessee authorities and the OCA um to
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
ensure there was um you know there was
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
safe plans of care in the meantime so um
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
again I think what rather than
 
01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.830 align:start position:0%
again I think what rather than
readjudication

01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
readjudication
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
what I will say is we feel confident
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
that thanks to the OCA raising the alarm
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
and our ability to mobilize teams to get
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
down there and to um and to to build on
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
what had been previously observed and um
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
reported to us we were able to work
 
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with Tennessee
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
authorities and with our own um teams
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire to get the youth
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
um back to Safe places so I don't you
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
know while I think bledo was a a
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
terrible um uh situation I'm so grateful
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
that uh the state was able to return
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
those youth safely I also don't know
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
that focusing on the one El lier um
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
while we need to be prepared in in the
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
event that something like that were to
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
happen again I think we need to
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
recognize also that um many of the
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
programs that we certify are um are very
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
high quality and have um have have have
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
changed lives for the better as as many
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions Perez thank you Mr chair for
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
allowing me and thank you for taking my
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
question can I ask you again do you just
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
say the three weeks it seems like a long
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
time but it's not a long time for
 
01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
children to to go through this
 
01:14:57.149 --> 01:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
process I just I just kind of like want
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
like no I mean time Horizons are tricky
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
I mean is is uh just as sitting in a
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
windowless emergency room uh as a child
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
who's boarding in the emergency
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
department is a 3 weeks is is too long
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
um we would argue that we need to take
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
decisive action um also in situations
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
when risks are presented so um you know
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
we've we feel confident that we got
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
those youth back safely that we designed
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
plans of care so that they were um
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
returned returned safely returned as
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
promptly as was necessary um we are
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
constant is everything in the
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
residential system and in those
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
emergency situations perfect absolutely
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
not that's why we've been working both
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
before the bledo incident and
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
subsequently to analyze everything
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's gone on and how we can improve
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
and I would State again that that's why
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
these sometimes more than monthly it
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
felt like for a while weekly meetings um
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
with the office of the child advocate to
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
get their input on our Improvement as
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
well as our ability to coordinate so
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
that when they make a visit or when the
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
dcyf team makes a visit or when the bcbh
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
team makes a visit we're exchanging
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
information so that in the future um
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of how we want to judge three
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
or four weeks that we're able to be even
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
tighter with our process to coordinate
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
safe thank you Mr CH thank you Mr
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing me to have this
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
question before these children were sent
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
to bledo was anybody sent to the
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
facility to check out the facility to
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
see how it was operational and interview
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
any of the children that were already
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
living there so at that time we were
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
still operating as were most States
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
under covid era protocols that allowed
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
virtual visits in place of in-person
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
visits obviously that has now changed um
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
and again I want to emphasize that for
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
those particularly um vulnerable DCF
 
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
Affiliated youth who have experienced um
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and many other
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
adversities in their life we're still
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
making monthly visits um for those youth
 
01:17:04.629 --> 01:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
even during Co so during the covid uh oh
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up so even during the
 
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.669 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up so even during the
covid

01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
times people were able to visit
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
facilities by wearing masks if they you
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
know to protect themselves so I don't
 
01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.149 align:start position:0%
know to protect themselves so I don't
understand

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
hand so during covid we did things like
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
virtual tours and virtual visits with
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
clinicians for the certification process
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to individual youth they
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
were accompanied by dcyf staff and that
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
those staff were responsible for looking
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
at the facilities when they arrived with
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
the youth and ensuring they were leaving
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
them in a safe environment so there were
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
eyes on the facility by DHHS staff when
 
01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
facility followup
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
chair I don't want to compare this to
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
looking for a home but if you look at an
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
ML MLS listing and you're looking
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
through the pictures and then you go to
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
the house to look at the house it looks
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
totally different than what a virtual T
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
question in there somewhere right so I
 
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.669 align:start position:0%
question in there somewhere right so I
don't

01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
the reasoning to
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
not other than
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
covid what was the justification to just
 
01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
rely on a virtual
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
tour as being a
 
01:18:45.629 --> 01:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
sufficient way to judge a
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
facility so I think knowing the history
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
in the context around certification and
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
it moving to the division of Behavioral
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
Health is important prior to a few years
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
ago and right before the pandemic The
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau for children's Behavioral Health
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
did not exist all of these functions
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
existed with in DCF and that was the
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
regular practice that the DCF workers
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
would be doing that work as they went
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
down there in order to enhance the
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
oversight of residential treatment and
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
move our system forward we now have a
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
residential unit within the Bureau for
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health that has
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
taken on those functions um but that
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
really was the norm previous
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
that DCF in partnership with the DCF
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
workers the did certification were the
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
individuals responsible for those
 
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
on-site visits when we were using new
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
providers um additionally we do confer
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
with our neighboring states and the
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
licensing entity in the home state to
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
talk to the people who have been on site
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
input eyes on the facility it's also
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
worth noting even prior to covid um
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
visits by DCF were occurring quarterly
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
um we increased that to to monthly and
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
and again now that we're it's
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's in a strange way the world has
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
gotten in some ways so back to normal
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
that even certain things I think of um
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
relatives um who passed away who we had
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
to say goodbye to over iPads there were
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
realities during covid that were very
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
different and we are grateful that we're
 
01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
now back to a place where um those who
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
are most vulnerable Among Us are um
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to be seen with eyes on
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
so we share your concern in that
 
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
regard thank you representative
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
Deon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
question um you said it can take up to
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
120 days to get a contract
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
signed do want said in the ballpark I
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
think that's best case thank you yeah
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
followup follow up sure thank you Mr
 
01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking a followup
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
how long does it take to
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.950 align:start position:0%
how long does it take to
certify

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
certify
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
so certification is entirely voluntary
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to the engagement of the
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
provider if it's a company that we've
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
done business with before or um someone
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
that has a very um efficient business
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
office we can get them through the
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
certification process in less than a
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
month including booking travel to
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
another facility I have um Paula R who
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
does the certification visits for us
 
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
with me today on Monday she's going down
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
to Virginia to do the last step and look
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
at a new facility for a youth who we
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
cannot meet the needs anywhere else so
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
we can do it under a month if they are
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
able to get us all of their business
 
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
documentation their insurance
 
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
documentation their licensing
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
documentation a lot of it is the going
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
back and forth to say you didn't get
 
01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
what we need under the rules and walking
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
them through and really helping support
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
them and some of the programs really
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
need a lot of support and other programs
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
are are very quick to respond and
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
provide all of it but we'll process it
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
as soon as we have everything thank you
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
one more sure
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman one more question
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
please um you stated that you do monthly
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
visits now in my question to you is do
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
you notify these facilities that you're
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
coming or are they
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
spot surprise visits so it can be a mix
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
of both um and in fact even in the bledo
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
situation once the um issue had risen to
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
my level in the commissioner's office I
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
actually did order that a team be
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
assembled to do un announced visit it
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
turned out we ended up picking up the
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
kids even sooner so there wasn't um that
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
that step did not occur because we made
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
the ultimate decision that we just
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
needed to get them but that was an
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
example of where we have the authority
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
to do unannounced visits at any time and
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
we do that locally too as part of our um
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
performance Improvement uh process thank
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
you kindly further questions um I have
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative giit thank you Mr
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um just a uh another question
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
about the S the uh Contracting
 
01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
process my the the takeaway that I've
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe please correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
this is the basis of my question um is
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
it that a certification is more for like
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
a standardized care plan and Contracting
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
is for like a specific individual um who
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
just needs you know a a very tailored
 
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
care plan or is that not the case yeah
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
I'll take a first I'll take a First Step
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
at that so I would think of Contracting
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
as sort of like a when you're building a
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
system of um programs that you rely on
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
again I want to emphasize that for 99%
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
of our programs they're going through a
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
contracted entity that we work with
 
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
closely we we know these direct I mean
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
these are 99% of the kids served in
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
residential treatment are done uh
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
through a very closely connected network
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
of regional providers so um it's worth
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
it if you will to put in all that time
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
and negotiation and relationship
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
building to really craft a contract that
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense since they are going to be
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
taking many children and many many
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
dollarss right um and so it makes sense
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
to go through through that elaborate
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
process in these urgent cases where we
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
need to get a youth into a specialized
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
program that is not part of that current
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
offering that's the situation in which
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
again still require that high burden of
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
um uh or that high bar from the
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
certification but we might need to do a
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
one-off and not wait for the
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic um you know slowness of the
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
Contracting process to play out okay
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
followup followup sure so so in other
 
01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.950 align:start position:0%
followup followup sure so so in other
words

01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
maybe both entities would be appropriate
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
that that we contract some but we just
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
certify some absolutely and most of this
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
bill um helps inform and strengthen the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
the process so that we're able you know
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
with um the blessing and the the passage
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill to to even strengthen our
 
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
contracted oversight stronger and again
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's why I sort of struggle with the
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
the sense of division here because so
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
much we're in agreement with we're
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
working together to to take what is
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
already a strong program again a few
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
years ago there was no Contracting
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
process rates were not as nearly as
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
strong as they are um under our current
 
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
budget so much has gone on not only to
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
strengthen Residential Treatment but to
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduce the number of Youth
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
served this is the lowest number we've
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
never had four kids being served out of
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
our region um these n the success of our
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
children's system of care work is um is
 
01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
a it's considered a model nationally so
 
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is strength in
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
that contracted model while at the same
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
time offering that occasional bit of
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility when we need it um for kids
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
who's uh who's for which there's not a
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
program within our contracted menu to
 
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.550 align:start position:0%
program within our contracted menu to
serve

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
them thank you for allowing me to take
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
this ask this question on the contract
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
um if the contract it's a it's 120 day
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
process at best okay and if they go
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
through all the steps of developing this
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
contract let's say it doesn't get
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
approved does it leave the facility wide
 
01:26:06.189 --> 01:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
open for not being paid and opening us
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
ramifications I think that would be
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
arguable but the certification rules are
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
certification for payment and if they
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
comply with the certification for
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
payment rules the administrative rules
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
have the force and effective law and we
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be bound to pay them under the
 
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.870 align:start position:0%
would be bound to pay them under the
certification

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
rules any further questions seeing none
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to the reallocation of
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
money saved uh are you okay with the
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
Money Follows a
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
child is there is there an identifier of
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
the money following the child I think
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
that would be extremely complicated they
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a certain dollar amount
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
allocated that would be unspent we pay
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
bills as they come in we try to be as
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
responsible as possible but there would
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
not be for example a budget that's
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
approved for the Youth and money set
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
aside from the youth that then would be
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
moved somewhere else it's more on a
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
system level of whether or not we're
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
spending that amount on residential
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
treatment or not okay because I I just
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
think it's important to find locations
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
community um that the money is already
 
01:27:18.109 --> 01:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
there and we don't have to go through
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
the process of getting more money um so
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%

various committees in the past and um
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
you spoke about the fact that one of
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
your goals is to uh keep all kids in
 
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.000 align:start position:0%

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
goal follow up sure where are
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
we um we have um about 81 kids still out
 
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.149 align:start position:0%
we um we have um about 81 kids still out
of

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
state about 250 in
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
state and the region as was stated
 
01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
before we went from 15 kids out of
 
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
um one more question sure one more I'm
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
not sure if you're the one to ask this
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
question to and um if you can't answer
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay um in order to make sure
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
that these facilities are safe for these
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
kids optimally how many inspectors do
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
you think we
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
need yeah that uh we only have three
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and that would be with bcbh not
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
with DCF but in but we are responsible
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
for visiting monthly so we do have
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
probation officers and cpsws going down
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
visiting kids face to face on a monthly
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
basis in all of our outer State
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
facilities thank you very much thank you
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
for other questions uh representative
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
FL thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question are the people that
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
do visit these children uh know have met
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
the children beforehand and know what's
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
going on with the case because as we
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
know children that see a familiar face
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
or know a familiar name coming to them
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
they tend to be a little bit more
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
welcoming to talk to that person cuz a
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
lot of kids it's hard especially in
 
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
those situations it's hard for them to
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
trust someone to talk to especially
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
about situations like down in the
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
facility there um to open up about those
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
situations yes good question that would
 
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
be our preference um but through
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
scheduling you know to send someone down
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
to Florida or Texas or Arkansas um at a
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
moment's notice uh it's difficult
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's people want to leave Etc so it's
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
not always possible on the other hand to
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
have people going down objectively who
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
may not know the kid but go in with a
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
different set of eyes and and meet the
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
child and see the facility is also has
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
some benefit to it but our preference
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
would be to have the actual worker go
 
01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
down and see their kids
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
for other questions um I have one uh
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh finance and I like
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
the emergency we had in
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
blo uh you needed Appropriations to look
 
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.229 align:start position:0%
blo uh you needed Appropriations to look
for

01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
other um alternatives for these children
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh is that identified so if the children
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
are pulled from out of state that's at a
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
six7 8,000 how much do it cost to put
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
somebody out of the region yeah um the
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
rates vary with different facilities
 
01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
from five to 10 five to 10 thousand uh a
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
month a month maybe if you're lucky okay
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they're very they're very
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
expensive the the out of state
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
facilities are usually more expensive
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
than in state okay uh so would you
 
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
identify that funding for
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
Alternatives well yeah we we currently
 
01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
have existing uh we have 260 kids in
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
state now we have facilities that have
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
some opening so they would move into
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
that so in this case with bledo they
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
moved into another existing quality um
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
facility um but and we're also building
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives as we speak Community Based
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
current appropriation right so they
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to a facility they can
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
stay forced home kin or with birth
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
families with a lot of support great
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
super any further questions see none
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%

I'm only going to be um brief in my
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
testimony uh this morning um in
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
September of 2022 there were
 
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
1,169 New Hampshire youth um that were
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
placed with other family members in
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
foster homes or in group or residential
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
facilities which is a staggering number
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
um you heard that there's about four 440
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
in residential placement there's another
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
approximately um at least in 2022 800
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
that were placed in um other placements
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the the home um research has
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
found that compared with siblings who
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
remained at the home children placed out
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
of home have an increased risk of

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
further found that a foster home is
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
better than an institution and that
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
having as you've heard only one and only
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
stable placement is important for a

01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
as it revises the criteria for out of
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%

01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%

01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
programs however um we do have a couple
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
of concerns with the bill um the first
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
being um the requirement that no
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
children be placed outside of New
 
01:34:59.470 --> 01:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
England um as you've heard we've got now
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
four children that are outside of New
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
England um and we do believe that due to
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing short staffing placement
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
shortages as well as certain Specialized
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
Care that a child may need that there
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
should be an exception in the bill for
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
children um when there is no placement
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
that can be found quickly um for a child
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
who may maybe in an emergency room and
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
or if you have a child who is needs
 
01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care and that Specialized
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
Care cannot be provided within New
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
England that there should be exceptions
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
made for those children um additionally
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about um
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
certification versus Contracting um Nami
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is an organization who has
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
contracted with the state and we can um
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
let the committee know that from our own
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
experience that Contracting with DHHS in
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
the state can be very cumbersome and
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
time consuming and as a result could
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
lead to the delay in care for youth um
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
so we do have concerns about the
 
01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
Contracting Provisions um because um we
 
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
have seen that it usually takes a lot
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
more than 120 days to get a contract in
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
place and therefore there could be
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
delays in the care of children in in our
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
state for the one-offs that you've heard
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
who need to go to um specialized out of
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
state placements um not I mean New
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's in support of um House
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 1573 while urging amendments
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
allowing for exceptions to the
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
Restriction that no child be placed
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
outside of New England and eliminating
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
the Contracting process um that has been
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
discussed and with that I will take any
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you oh I'm
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
sorry did you have a question
 
01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.189 align:start position:0%
sorry did you have a question
representative

01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
kab okay we're good thank you thank you
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Gilbert good morning representative long
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
today I just want to go ahead and recap
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony that you heard
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
today from both the department and
 
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
OCA uh the department went ahead and HD
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
it right on the head uh with their lip
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
service that we're expecting the
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
department to govern themselves uh
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
something that they're already failing
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
at doing um so with this I do support
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I do believe that there is a
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
need for this additional oversight I I
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
do not believe that the department
 
01:37:36.109 --> 01:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
should be overseeing themselves uh they
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
do have that bureaucracy uh Gap there
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
that is causing a
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
extreme amount of time and delay with
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
regards to these
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
children um I would perpetually say that
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
oca's uh rendition of what they're
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
requesting is 100% valid and the lip
 
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
service from the Department uh is just
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
that lip service um we'll go ahead and
 
01:38:08.109 --> 01:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
you know just give you a real sense of a
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
real life situation that's occurring uh
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
residential

01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
not so out out of out of out of home
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
that that is correct you oh that is
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
correct child this place out of my child
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
is placed in a New Hampshire contracted
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
facility okay at this current juncture
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead I I I I will just say that my
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
child left the facility yet again last
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
night uh this is a repeating occurrence
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
that our facility ities are not having
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
the oversight from both the department
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh and from
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
DCF um from Behavioral Health and DCF um
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've been requesting for over a year
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
for my child to be removed from the
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
residential facility that they are in
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
currently the child has been having sex
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
on the unit in this residential facility
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
with the lack of oversight and
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
accommodations to ensure that these
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
children are being properly
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
supervised um my child has left multiple
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
times with the facility not even
 
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing or knowing that they're gone
 
01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
for multiple
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
hours um this is a lower secure facility
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
so understandably but the facility
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
themselves recognizes that they have a
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
severe crisis with Staffing and the
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
department is not addressing that to
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're addressing and not
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
sending additional more children in
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
there to be harmed the the Staffing
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
level of this particular facility for my
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge or belief is around 30 to 40
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
um and we're continually going ahead and
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
you know keeping that facility at that
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
maximum capacity really uh when they
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
cannot support that number of children
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
um all the parties behind me are well
 
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
aware of this uh the department spoke uh
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
lip service regarding my particular
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
child in their
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um so I really feel that there
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
is some things that need to be done here
 
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
and we're going to keep driving this
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
home for everybody very good thank you
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%

Panic thank you for allowing me to take
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%

question um you said that no one
 
01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.149 align:start position:0%

01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
oversees
 
01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh doesn't the department have
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
oversight through the D HHS uh oversight
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee so I have attempted to reach
 
01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
out to them and I was strictly and
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
strongly uh protested by the former
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
director and attorney Baker uh when I
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
attempted to go forward saying that they
 
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
were not going to allow me to speak
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you thank you Mr
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
Gober uh just just uh one other question
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
for whomever may be able to answer it uh
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
is is there an estimated time of stay in
 
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.669 align:start position:0%
is is there an estimated time of stay in
these

01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh and these out of home
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
residential is is there an average is
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
there an average or it's not or you
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
average you know is it a year is it six
 
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
it um so don't have that information at
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
my fingertips I will say that the state
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
vary our commitment is to make these
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
episodic therapeutic episodes of care so
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
they need to be um always under the
 
01:41:59.950 --> 01:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
clinical um appropriate clinical
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
supervision while regularly being
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
reassessed through our comprehensive um
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
assessment process to ensure that the
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
youth AR better served in another
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
setting so I don't have an an I don't I
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
don't even know that we track that um
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
but what we can say is that our
 
01:42:14.589 --> 01:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
commitment toward reform that we
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
continue to work with Advocates with a
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
child advocate on Etc is for these to be
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
um uh again to avoid void Residential
 
01:42:23.589 --> 01:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
Treatment whenever necessary when it is
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
utilized to ensure that that is a um
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
episode I can speak to level five
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
because we just opened our first prtf at
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
Hamstead um hospital and the stays there
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
are um roughly six months um a little in
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
order to um build skills for return to
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
the community okay great uh Miss
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
Sanchez thank you for allowing me to
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer this question um so this is
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
actually the next step of looking at our
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
residential care and the use of
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
residential in the state of New hampsh
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
for the office of the child advocate so
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're starting to try to dig into that
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
data we know there are kids that are
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
languishing in care for multiple years
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
and so that is an absolutely concern of
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
ours and that is why it's one of the
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
focuses of this bill is for it to be
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
short-term episodic stay of treatment
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
because that is not happening right now
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
we have many kids that are lingering in
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
residential facilities that are ready to
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
move on very good thank
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
you having uh no more cards I'll close
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing on uh 1573
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll ask if uh would we be ready
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
to exec
 
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
this any anybody GNA I yeah I'm I'm
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
clear on contract to to certification
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
clear any
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
anybody are we ready
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
to I'm just wondering are are we
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to be looking at the two
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
amendments and the bill and then
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
executing on whichever one is best
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
personally i' think we'd need a little
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
more time I think I do okay
 
01:43:59.470 --> 01:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh you agree you need a little more time
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
too yes um just so we can go over the
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
Amendments kind of more thoughtfully
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
this this is a lot of information to
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
take in yeah we just had an hour and a
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.550 --> 01:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
so all right so uh I guess I guess we'll
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
wait I guess huh all right very good
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sure can we move uh
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
exact possibly toward the end of the day
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
to give people the opportunity to peruse
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
the Amendments
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
submitted and
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
Reas yeah do we want to or well the
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
thing is what the consensus this is
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to a second committee uh which
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
which has to be out so we'll have to
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
come back well why don't we just take a
 
01:44:50.109 --> 01:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
simple vote on it if we want to execute
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
or not okay because I guess I guess
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
multiple people are are having different
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
opinions okay those those uh that those
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
that feel they have enough information
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
up so three four five six seven 8 N9 10
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
11 uh so I those those that don't put
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
your hand up so I can make sure I'm
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
counting right those that
 
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
don't don't you're going to go great
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to exact uh Mr uh Mr
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um so with that
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%

forth by DHHS I move this as ought to
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%

01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:04.430 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh 202
24-42

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
24-42
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
7h uh seconded by representative D
 
01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:11.719 align:start position:0%
smon may I speak to my motion and you
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
may thank you as everyone said as doing
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
side by sides I agree the uh two
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
amendments are very similar in fact when
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
the office of child Advocates Deputy um
 
01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh spoke at some length about what the
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
court needed to do uh I first got the
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
impression that that was something that
 
01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
only their amendments spoke of but in
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
fact looking at the dhh amendment it's
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
in there pretty much word for word to
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
repeat these bills are virtually the
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
same the only difference has to do with
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
certification versus contract testimony
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
was given that this is only
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
1% where there are not contracts that
 
01:47:06.350 --> 01:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
all the others are in
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
contracts and uh testimony was given
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
that uh 120 days to hop through all of
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
these hopes is
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh a great thing if it happens
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
and that flexibility is needed so I
 
01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
believe that the DHHS amendment gives us
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
99% of what everybody wants but on the
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
one issue of
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
Contracting as my opinion
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS amendment is the better
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
one very good uh the I mean the only the
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
only the only thing that's not in this
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'm interested in but it
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
appears that we may not be able to track
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
it is the uh money following a child I
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
think it's important because if we're
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
saving money the state has has a
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
tendency to save money uh and my goal
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
would be to have that money going to the
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
child uh in some other alternative and
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like that identified uh but it my
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's really not
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
identified evidently there's a uh
 
01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's a fund they use for these
 
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
there's a fund they use for these
alternative

01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
programs uh when it runs out they may
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
have to go to cover and Council to get
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
more uh am I in line uh saying okay so
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct all right um yeah
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
that that that would be the only issue
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh that I would like to add I wantan to
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
I want to be assured that the state's
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
not gaining Revenue by saving money uh
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
when we need it to go to this child
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson is it your
 
01:48:51.149 --> 01:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
experience as it has been in mind that
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes at these hearings when we kind
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
of like
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
something the department hears that yep
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely I see them shaking their head
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
and it's giving me that warm and fuzzy
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
feel Sor that's
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate yeah no that'd be good
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah so I I
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm clear within I'm I'm clear on
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
the certification and the contract and
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
it appears to me the contract is a
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
little more complicated and a little
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
more holds back the child
 
01:49:25.629 --> 01:49:25.639 align:start position:0%
um and I wasn't clear as to the
 
01:49:25.639 --> 01:49:27.270 align:start position:0%
um and I wasn't clear as to the
advantage

01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
of you know uh I I am clear on the
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
accountability aspect uh that
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
accountability needs to be there whether
 
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
it's less than 1% or whether it's one
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
child that accountability needs to be
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
there uh you know and we need to follow
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
up with that uh any further discussion
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just wanted to say that um my
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
concern is like I want to make sure that
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
these kids don't H to wa so long in
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
order for something to happen and that's
 
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
the only that's the only concern that I
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
have because from what I hear from both
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
testimonies um it seems to one is like
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the timing how much
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
time that the kids has to waigh in order
 
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
to get out of that
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation and that's the only concern
 
01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
that I do have time time time we should
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
not be putting these kids to go through
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
weeks and weeks and weeks of waiting if
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's something like this happen again I
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that these kids
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't has to wait so long and suffer Al
 
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for these kids and we
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
should make things happen
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you it's a good point
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Craig
 
01:50:52.589 --> 01:50:52.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm you know
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
after here I understand the difference
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
between the contracts and the
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
certification I just want to make sure
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not saying and I understand
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
the time I mean certainly 672 hours for
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
those kids to wait after we figured out
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
they were in an abusive situation is 672
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
hours too long so um I want to make sure
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
though that we're not cutting Corners uh
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
to make you know that we're saying okay
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
this will be quicker so let's cut this
 
01:51:20.189 --> 01:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
corner so that we can make this quicker
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
has to we have to have both you know I I
 
01:51:26.189 --> 01:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
I would feel better if if I felt like
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS was like yes this was this was a a
 
01:51:32.069 --> 01:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
stop and we should have done this or and
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a legal reason that they're
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
not saying anything um but I think there
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
is more accountability in this amendment
 
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that's fine but it's
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
certainly something that I would be
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
continuing to watch very closely because
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
I to make sure that this is
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
enough any further
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.310 align:start position:0%
enough any further

the Department's intent to report um we
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
had in testimony that they never
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
received any um previous warning and was
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
reported to the passport denial program
 
02:11:34.549 --> 02:11:34.559 align:start position:0%
um having their passport denied without
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
them being in the correct aage amount um
 
02:11:39.229 --> 02:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
at the threshold of the federal
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
government uh of that program um it also
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
requires DHS DHHS to submit the
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
individual obligor pay frequency into
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
the department s software to avoid a
 
02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
reage triggers of unnecessary reporting
 
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
grman thank you Mr chairman um
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
so this would be introducing a a new
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
automated system is that a a new system
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
I my question is this a new system being
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
added or according to the woman that was
 
02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
here I think her first name was Lily
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
with DHHS she said their system was
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that of breaking it
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
down and she believe that that it was at
 
02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
some individual
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
cases and is there a cost associated
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
with the update not that that they
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
presented she said this bill will have
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
no impact on DHHS yes
 
02:12:55.189 --> 02:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
B

02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%

please what was the question right right
 
02:15:12.149 --> 02:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
what's the question she's about to
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
answer it and it will be better if she
 
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
knows the question thank you Mr chairman
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh how does this work out for your
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
department um and like the 10 days that
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
sort of thing is it are there any
 
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
problems whether it's going to be a
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
smooth transition or does it and you
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
know does it work for you I would have a
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
a concern with the 10 days only in that
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it gives the uh the obligor
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
time to respond and that if we send
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
something out and we have and in 10 days
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to report them
 
02:15:49.950 --> 02:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
that by the time we do something through
 
02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.109 align:start position:0%
that by the time we do something through
the

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
mail to get them to be able to respond
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't that would be a a burden on
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
them so I think a longer time would be
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
good um the other issue we have is in
 
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
par paragraph B that's all new
 
02:16:08.589 --> 02:16:08.599 align:start position:0%
um and there's definitely going to be
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
some uh changes to our system that are
 
02:16:12.990 --> 02:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to be that are going to be needed
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
we did not do previously do a fiscal
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
note for this for this for this bill
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh the bill takes effect in 60
 
02:16:26.990 --> 02:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
days uh so that's problematic I'm
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that is also definitely
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Grossman thank you Mr
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
chairman so seeing this amendment now do
 
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
you think there would be need to be a
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to this
 
02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:48.509 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to this
upgrade

02:16:48.509 --> 02:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
you we Che yes one more
 
02:16:58.679 --> 02:17:00.910 align:start position:0%
you we Che yes one more
followup

02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
followup
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
um is this an issue that comes up often
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
so for our committee we've only seen
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
this issue come up before with one case
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if this is an issue
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
happen more than
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
once the different touch
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
points where these issues are brought
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
up we give a a lot of information to to
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
the obligor who come come to our program
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
when they when they first get get signed
 
02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
up they get a lot of information about
 
02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
wage assignment and about all the
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
different kinds of collection then they
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
they get a notice of debt once they they
 
02:17:43.389 --> 02:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
get to a certain amount and that talks
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
about all the different kinds of
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement that can go against them and
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
then there's what's called a Pawn's
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
notice which I'm sure stands for
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
something um and that deals with
 
02:17:59.709 --> 02:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.910 --> 02:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
offset so notice is a big is generally a
 
02:18:05.230 --> 02:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
big thing in in child support and notice
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:14.669 --> 02:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
better representative
 
02:18:17.549 --> 02:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
Panic um I'd like an upgrade on your
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
next door neighbor here I must
 
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to respond to um
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative grman if I recall from uh
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
Spain's original testimony I think he
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
said there was something like 400 cases
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
that had that problem if I my
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
else before I call the question I just
 
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
wonder going to ask the uh committee if
 
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
you really think that with the amendment
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
it's good to go and they'll get it done
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
as they get it done and you know takes
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
effect in 60 days 60 days after the
 
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
house approves it the Senate approves it
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
and the governor signs it um because if
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
we are going to um delay and ask for
 
02:19:14.309 --> 02:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
another amendment I'm not sure we can
 
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
get it in under the wire so are we good
 
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you Mr
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so if I remember
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um there was not a notice
 
02:19:28.589 --> 02:19:28.599 align:start position:0%
given to representative Spain that was
 
02:19:28.599 --> 02:19:29.549 align:start position:0%
given to representative Spain that was
one

02:19:29.549 --> 02:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:19:32.589 --> 02:19:32.599 align:start position:0%
issue uh I don't believe that was
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
400 people my understanding is that it's
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
a uh was it $2500 or
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
$5,000 with respect to passports 2500
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
um so I I mean is that possible that I
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
would be in a RAR rage for $10 and my
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
passport would be
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
withheld from the feds because they
 
02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
don't know because your report just says
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in a RAR it doesn't say $10 or
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
$1,000 or
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
$2500 no because our system only reports
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
them if they're over the
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
amount right so the automated system
 
02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:19.230 align:start position:0%
amount right so the automated system
over

02:20:19.230 --> 02:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
reports when they're over the
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
$2500 to the
 
02:20:28.190 --> 02:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
fets okay and how just we cannot discuss
 
02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
the details of of Mr Spain's case he he
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
did right he did but they can't okay um
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm fine thanks representative
 
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson if I
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
recall the testimony it was that you
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
report when it's over 2500 but you do
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
not take it off the list until it's zero
 
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
so in other words it can REM remain on
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
there even if it's only $5 is that
 
02:21:02.190 --> 02:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
correct that's
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
you I sure yeah so originally it was
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
over $2,500 correct okay so if it if
 
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
once it's 25 over $2,500 it gets
 
02:21:21.710 --> 02:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
reported okay and then it doesn't it
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't fluctuate back and forth if you
 
02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
go back and forth over and under and
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
over and under it's there until it goes
 
02:21:30.110 --> 02:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
to zero okay thank
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
chairman so as I'm reading both the bill
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
and and the amendment I don't see
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
anything in this language that would
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
change someone who hasn't completely
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
gotten down to Zero from having to still
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
work with with the passport office to
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
fix that nothing in this changes that
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay I saw I thought I saw another
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
hand I did representative
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
Pearson I think that what it does say if
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this that you would not
 
02:22:13.469 --> 02:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
continue to report it if it doesn't meet
 
02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
the federal threshold so in other words
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
once it's under the $2500 should be
 
02:22:19.469 --> 02:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
removed or maybe I just I'm reading it
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
very quickly I'm sorry I'm trying to do
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
correctly I I suppose it could be read
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
that way that is not the way that is not
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
the way we read it as the the reporting
 
02:22:44.670 --> 02:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
the to the to the federal government
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
government is that's the way that the
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
federal government does it this is
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we've made up
 
02:22:55.389 --> 02:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
that says we're just going to keep
 
02:22:57.070 --> 02:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
reporting it even if it goes below
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's how the system
 
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
works followup if I recall in testimony
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
um wasn't isn't this a situation where
 
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you're getting paid bi-weekly half
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
the year you're always going to be in a
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:23:20.429 --> 02:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
because it's it's divided into 52
 
02:23:22.110 --> 02:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
payments so at every other week you're
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to be behind if I'm I'm sorry I'm
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
just trying to recall what
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
that sometimes it can be possible but
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to have a very large
 
02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
order to be $2,500 behind every other
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
week will they followup followup isn't
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
it possible that some people have very
 
02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:44.590 align:start position:0%
it possible that some people have very
large

02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
large
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
orders it it it is and in cases like
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
that where we see that that would be
 
02:23:53.790 --> 02:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
happening we can exempt a case from from
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
being reported automatically so that we
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't so that we don't hit that thank
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Greg thank you Mr
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking our
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
questions today so just to recap I I
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure because this is a
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we've kind of been back and
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
forth on a couple times if someone has
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
like say they have this thing where it's
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly but they get paid or they It's
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
weekly but they get paid bi-weekly
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a way that they can from what
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
you said before that that can be
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted like it's not just you guys
 
02:24:29.950 --> 02:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
aren't set in stone like you have to be
 
02:24:31.630 --> 02:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
by-weekly so there's a way for somebody
 
02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
to have personal responsibility to make
 
02:24:35.950 --> 02:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
sure that they're not falling into rears
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
by changing that schedule or by working
 
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
on that schedule is that
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
correct our systems can take into
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
account when somebody gets paid the
 
02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
money's coming in weekly and then
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how the child support is
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
ordered it can be a monthly amount it
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
could be a bi-weekly that type of thing
 
02:24:56.830 --> 02:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
okay so it'll acrew
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly it'll money comes in monthly
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
and then of course somebody changes and
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
it that that changes again but the order
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
acrel stays the same with the court
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
order until it changes okay but it's not
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
like they're sorry followup followup
 
02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
it's not that
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
they're but there's not an inherent like
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
set up to to fail on this like there's
 
02:25:21.469 --> 02:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
there's a way that somebody can work
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
with the system so that they're not
 
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands uh the
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
motion before us is on Amendment

role welcome back

on
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
ITF well I was looking for an
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
explanation of the
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
you have people who are being
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
denied P thoughts or something that's
 
02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
beyond their
 
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
control due to the reporting current
 
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
control due to the reporting current
reporting

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:28:36.269 --> 02:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
situation it's it's
 
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
not oh I'm sorry oh my gosh my pet peeve
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
were you were you talking
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
no I never said a word
 
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
that means you can repeat it what I'm
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
looking for is probably not am I you
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
know we got an amendment on so that
 
02:28:56.349 --> 02:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
means somebody thought there must be
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
they could do it better with an
 
02:29:00.030 --> 02:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
amendment or something defective in it
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
so what is is it that's right about it
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
or should we just move it to get it to
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate so they can these folks over
 
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
there can fix
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.190 --> 02:29:20.200 align:start position:0%

02:29:55.389 --> 02:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
see people coming in and really tell us

you know the real story behind this bill
that's

02:29:59.830 --> 02:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:02.190 align:start position:0%
that's
all

02:30:02.190 --> 02:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um the the feedback that we got
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire legal aid said that
 
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
they opposed the bill relative to the
 
02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
criteria uh
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
for reporting child support
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
delinquencies to federal agencies
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
because if passed it would put the state
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
system out of compliance with Federal
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
requirements so we don't want to cause
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
federal representative
 
02:30:37.150 --> 02:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman so to build
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
on what uh representative Perez says um
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
the this seems to be legislating for one
 
02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
particular case that's the only and it's
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
the the the the bill um author and I I
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
struggle to ethically to pass a bill for
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
one person especially when we heard
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from that person multiple
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
times about multiple different areas
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
about how how in aars he was first it
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
was pennies then it was a couple dollars
 
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
then it was $5 and we never saw
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
paperwork to say that this is what it
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
was we heard Contra you know
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
contradictory testimony from the office
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
of Child Support saying No this is how
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
our syst works we can tell somebody how
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
much they're in a rear it doesn't we've
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the federal guidelines it
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't trigger until
 
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
$2,500 I mean at the basis we're here
 
02:31:28.349 --> 02:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
for the kids and to make sure that
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
they're getting their payments and this
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
because one person is having an issue I
 
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
don't see why we're legislating a bill
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
person anyone else yes representative
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson um I
 
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we're respect respectfully I
 
02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
don't think we're legislating for one
 
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
person and I do think we're legislating
 
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
for their children if that one person
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
could not get their passport in order to
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
go see their children that could be a
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
case out there I think this is a case
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
where there's smoke there's fire um if
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
one person came up who happened to be a
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
legislator that this happened to so he
 
02:32:07.269 --> 02:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
knew there was a way of dealing with it
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
the average person is just going to say
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
you can't fight City Hall this is the
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
way you but this is the way things are
 
02:32:17.429 --> 02:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
um I think that we we fortunate that it
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
happened to a representative who could
 
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
bring it to our attention because I'm
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
sure that's it's happening to more than
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
can't anyone
 
02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
else Panic
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
what Sandra Panic oh representative see
 
02:32:43.469 --> 02:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
my I have a nice seating chart now now
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
all I have to do thank you now all I
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
have to do is see okay representative
 
02:32:50.590 --> 02:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you thank you representative
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson for allowing me to make
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
my put my two cents in um if I
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
recall when representative Spain did his
 
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
testimony he was
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
consistent about it being $5 in the rare
 
02:33:11.230 --> 02:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
because every time I sat down I write
 
02:33:14.190 --> 02:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
notes on my paper and I date on the back
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
of it what was said so I I see the
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
consistency here uh he was going to go
 
02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
for a job in Canada he was doing a job
 
02:33:28.230 --> 02:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
in Canada he could not do that job
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
because he was not able to fly to that
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
fly to his job so that hurts his family
 
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know to I I think a simple software
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
fix and he did say numerous times there
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
was over 400 people that he personally
 
02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:50.590 align:start position:0%
was over 400 people that he personally
knows

02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
of that were you know affected by this
 
02:33:58.110 --> 02:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
type of situation and it's a simple fix
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
a computer fix a software fix that's
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
it representative long thank you Mr
 
02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm voting yes on the itl uh
 
02:34:12.190 --> 02:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
especially where the amendment didn't
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment would have uh
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
detailed better
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
um detailed better this fix uh again uh
 
02:34:25.870 --> 02:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
when I look at it across the board um
 
02:34:27.550 --> 02:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not getting constituents that have
 
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
have a complaint and I've spoke to
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
plenty of them that have been in a rear
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
Ridge 500 a th000 um the claim was that
 
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
they never got a notice uh but they were
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
alerted by
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
passport um that their passport had to
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
be redone because they were in the RAR
 
02:34:50.590 --> 02:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
now we heard today that in order to get
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
that notice to the feds they got to be
 
02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
$2,500 in the
 
02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:56.389 align:start position:0%
$2,500 in the
rear

02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
rear
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
so you know I I don't I don't see where
 
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see where that um yeah I don't
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
see where that was stating so I I I'm
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of where the glitch is but
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
there may be a glitch somewhere uh and
 
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
also there's no fiscal note it's has
 
02:35:16.510 --> 02:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
testified to today there's going to be a
 
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
cost to this um what that cost is um I
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't know um so that that's why I'm I'm
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to vote to uh itail could I ask
 
02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:28.349 align:start position:0%
going to vote to uh itail could I ask
the

02:35:28.349 --> 02:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
agency if ever an
 
02:35:33.870 --> 02:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
investigation was launched as to what
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
went wrong in the case of this
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
individual because he got the notice and
 
02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
yet it he shouldn't have gotten the
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
notice but he got one so why was there
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
ever any attempt to find out where the
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
us uh unfortunately with I can't address
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
anything that specifically happens in
 
02:36:10.349 --> 02:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
any particular case without a a waiver
 
02:36:12.910 --> 02:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
of confidentiality under our
 
02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:14.910 align:start position:0%

02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative katab thank you Mr
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:36:24.750 --> 02:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
question could you tell us I assume
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
after seeing this Bell that you would
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
have researched and looked into to see
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
if you could find and identify any
 
02:36:33.389 --> 02:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
potential cases where the person was in
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
a rears less than
 
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
$2500 where something like this may have
 
02:36:40.950 --> 02:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
happened did you find any such cases I'm
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
not asking you specifically names or who
 
02:36:44.269 --> 02:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
they were but did you find any such
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
cases that existed I did not do any any
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
research to to that end in that that's
 
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
not my role I wouldn't know I would have
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
to have asked somebody to do it and I
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we that we looked
 
02:37:01.389 --> 02:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I don't I'm uncomfortable
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
with the back and forth um so my
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
question is regarding changes that this
 
02:37:15.479 --> 02:37:16.429 align:start position:0%
question is regarding changes that this
bill

02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
would create within the child support
 
02:37:21.389 --> 02:37:21.399 align:start position:0%
department because my notes from last
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
time is that there is no fiscal note
 
02:37:25.630 --> 02:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
because there would not this bill would
 
02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
not change the practice of the
 
02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
department at all uh were it to pass
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
which is why my vote was will be
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
probably itl unless I'm told differently
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
right now because my note says um that
 
02:37:41.269 --> 02:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
you take the position you're already in
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
compliance it's a federally certified
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
automated system programmed with the
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines for reporting and you
 
02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
do include the amount that's sent to the
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
feds therefore this isn't going to cost
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
any money because there's literally
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
nothing that you would do
 
02:37:59.710 --> 02:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
differently yes that would that was our
 
02:38:02.429 --> 02:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
analysis when on the original okay has
 
02:38:04.710 --> 02:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
that changed as of today on the original
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry thank you that was rud of
 
02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%

02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
with malice um or intent to
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.359 --> 02:42:48.349 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

02:42:48.349 --> 02:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
you need a copy of
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
245h somewhere it's got a staple in
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
ites it was with the one the one we just
 
02:43:09.309 --> 02:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%

02:43:44.279 --> 02:44:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
about

02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes um sorry about
 
02:44:14.349 --> 02:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
that um didn't we do something similar
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:44:20.429 --> 02:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
this term we did said somebody said yes
 
02:44:20.439 --> 02:44:22.269 align:start position:0%
this term we did said somebody said yes
oh

02:44:22.269 --> 02:44:22.279 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:44:26.030 --> 02:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
you and remember what number it
 
02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:27.590 align:start position:0%
you and remember what number it
is

02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:44:30.190 --> 02:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
okay and what happened to that I mean
 
02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
are we doing
 
02:44:33.389 --> 02:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
duplicating well it's been the Senate
 
02:44:35.230 --> 02:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
already it failed in the Senate it was
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
yeah okay but this is sufficiently
 
02:44:42.269 --> 02:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
different apparently that it is allowed
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
to come in this year yeah right what I
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
like is if you darn it if you're going
 
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
to have a law has some teeth if you say
 
02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
thou shalt not there's got to be an or
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
else but I think the amendment is good
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
in that it is
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
restrained uh you'll notice on lines 24
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the following nothing shall provide
 
02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
civil or criminal immunity for a
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter who knowingly fails
 
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
to make a report as a mandatory reporter
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
I take that very seriously and I will
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
urge on the side of caution knowing that
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
it has to be investigated uh but I
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
cannot uh publicly speak to those who
 
02:45:26.429 --> 02:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
may have knowingly failed to do it for
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
any number of reasons and I like the
 
02:45:31.389 --> 02:45:31.399 align:start position:0%
teeth in this if you see it and you
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
should say it you must say it so it's
 
02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
teeth but it's it's it's teeth within
 
02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
reason I think representative long thank
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
so uh we're all we're all um uh
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.469 --> 02:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
so so if I don't know if it's abuse or
 
02:45:57.630 --> 02:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
neglect I'm not going to report it
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
because if I report it I may be charged
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
for uh filing a false report no it'd be
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
a good faith well that's what I'm
 
02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
reading here if it's good faith not it's
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
if it's in good
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
faith if it's in good faith oh okay so
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
if I do file a false report all I got to
 
02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
say is it's in did it in good faith it's
 
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
up to right it's up to the department to
 
02:46:21.550 --> 02:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
figure that out well it's not up to the
 
02:46:23.870 --> 02:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
department it's up to the court well
 
02:46:26.429 --> 02:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
whoever does the investigation yeah okay
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
and I I I just don't see where this
 
02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
helps with the issue that we have uh
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's still up to the court um I don't I
 
02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if those are I don't know how
 
02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
those are brought forward to the court
 
02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh maybe the other party that's being
 
02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
charged with abuse let's start at the
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
middle representative Greg thank you Mr
 
02:46:51.309 --> 02:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you representative
 
02:46:53.550 --> 02:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
long or vice chair long for bringing
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
that uh example up so when we're looking
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
at a bill like this um you know and what
 
02:47:00.429 --> 02:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about reporting and
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
we know that the people that take in the
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
reports have already said please don't
 
02:47:06.110 --> 02:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
do this because they have a great system
 
02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
for vetting those that are conscientious
 
02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be the ones that are
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
hesitant those that are that are worried
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
about you know maybe saying that it's
 
02:47:17.950 --> 02:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
abuse and it's not abuse those are the
 
02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
ones that that we're actually going to
 
02:47:23.790 --> 02:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
make hesitate more with legislation like
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
this those that are doing this for
 
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
malice or doing this to be cruel they
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
don't care about this kind of
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation they're doing it anyway
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
false police reports those are already
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
against the law we already have you know
 
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
measures to help keep this so what all
 
02:47:41.710 --> 02:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation does is it make
 
02:47:43.469 --> 02:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
those makes those that are conscientious
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
that are thinking about oh my gosh could
 
02:47:48.349 --> 02:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
I be doing this hesitate not the ones
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
that are doing this for malice they
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
don't care anyway they already know that
 
02:47:52.870 --> 02:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
you can't do
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
that so your conclusion about the
 
02:47:56.910 --> 02:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
amendment would be
 
02:47:59.830 --> 02:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
what um I would not be in support of it
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman um I'm the
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
one who pointed out during our hearing
 
02:48:10.830 --> 02:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
um about how a lot of other bills who
 
02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
have penalties for false reports a lot
 
02:48:14.349 --> 02:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
of bills a lot of other states have
 
02:48:16.469 --> 02:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
penalties for false reports um like my
 
02:48:18.429 --> 02:48:18.439 align:start position:0%
former state of New York have penalties
 
02:48:19.990 --> 02:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
for mandated reporters who fail to
 
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
report and so I appreciated seeing an
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that had that my I can't
 
02:48:29.070 --> 02:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
support it because it says for a
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter but New Hampshire has
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
this weird mandatory reporting law that
 
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
no other state in the country has that
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
says that every adult in New Hampshire
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
is a mandated reporter if this had the
 
02:48:45.110 --> 02:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
qualifier that it has later on in the
 
02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill where it says a professional
 
02:48:50.110 --> 02:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter so under on page two
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
under item nine it says any person in
 
02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
their professional capacity as a
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter I would feel better
 
02:48:59.389 --> 02:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
about it because really what the the
 
02:49:01.309 --> 02:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
point of having a crimal a penalty for
 
02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
someone failing to report is to get
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
those doctors and you know School
 
02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
professionals and other professionals
 
02:49:09.950 --> 02:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
who should know better who aren't
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
reporting but this hits you know your
 
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
neighbor down the street um and that's
 
02:49:16.750 --> 02:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
not the intent I don't want the neighbor
 
02:49:18.229 --> 02:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
down the street who has a genuine
 
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
concern about these kids to not call it
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
in because they're worried that they're
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to get in trouble with the law for
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
for failing to call it in I also don't
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
want the neighbor down the street to not
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
call it in because they think someone's
 
02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
going to think they're lying like we
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
want people to call and we want the
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
experts at the state to do their job so
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
I can't I I can't support it repr appr
 
02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
the try though repr representative
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
Gibbons thank you Mr chairman um my
 
02:49:52.750 --> 02:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
stepmother is a social worker and uh
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
I've talked to her extensively about
 
02:49:59.309 --> 02:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
this subject and she does confirm that
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are plenty of false reports um
 
02:50:05.950 --> 02:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
that are made to that she's in a
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
different state but regardless um if
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
they exist in other states they exist
 
02:50:13.229 --> 02:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
here too um there are plenty of people
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
that make false reports
 
02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
and she wishes that her state would
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
would enact some penalties because it
 
02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:24.190 align:start position:0%
would enact some penalties because it
would

02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
deter uh it would deter the false
 
02:50:28.750 --> 02:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
reports you're you're right that there
 
02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
are some people that are malicious
 
02:50:34.510 --> 02:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
enough to know that uh they might face
 
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
consequences and then do it anyway but
 
02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
the the whole point of creating a law
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
against false reports is so that you can
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
convict these people you can't convict
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
them if there is no law about it um the
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
other so so first of all false reports
 
02:50:57.469 --> 02:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
do happen secondly uh we need there to
 
02:50:59.910 --> 02:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
be some type of consequence for false
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
reports and you know maybe it's a a
 
02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion that I have with
 
02:51:07.070 --> 02:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues but I don't think
 
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
that this would
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
deter uh regular reporting because if
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
you're reporting in good faith you don't
 
02:51:16.030 --> 02:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
have to to know it's not your job to do
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
the investigation if you're reporting in
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
good faith then no harm comes to you
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's if you're reporting in bad faith
 
02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
and the department investigates it and
 
02:51:31.630 --> 02:51:31.640 align:start position:0%
they find that it was in in bad faith
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
that's when you can get
 
02:51:36.429 --> 02:51:36.439 align:start position:0%
convicted um
 
02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
it representative D
 
02:51:45.229 --> 02:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chairman I used an
 
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
analogy that happened to me I heard a
 
02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:49.990 align:start position:0%
analogy that happened to me I heard a
neighbor

02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
using horrifying language to their
 
02:51:57.389 --> 02:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
child I felt it was
 
02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
abusive I contacted the correct phone
 
02:52:04.349 --> 02:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
numbers and spoke to a person and said
 
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing this abuse going on
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
continually I don't know if it's illegal
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
or not but this child in family should
 
02:52:15.389 --> 02:52:15.399 align:start position:0%
be investigated
 
02:52:17.229 --> 02:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
blah blah
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
blah um I did get notified later that
 
02:52:28.910 --> 02:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:28.920 --> 02:52:30.670 align:start position:0%
 
abuse

02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
so a year later I saw the person
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
specifically hitting the
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
child called again my point of telling
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
that and and it was found abusive they
 
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
were investigated and they were helped
 
02:52:50.990 --> 02:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
they were assisted in understanding what
 
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
the difference between abuse and and not
 
02:52:57.389 --> 02:52:57.399 align:start position:0%
abuse was and the family thrived after
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
that and I was happy my point of saying
 
02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
this is one of the things that I called
 
02:53:06.229 --> 02:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
about was
 
02:53:09.429 --> 02:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
actually I still believe it's abusive
 
02:53:12.269 --> 02:53:12.279 align:start position:0%
but by law it's not abusive but it
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
didn't deter me from calling
 
02:53:18.349 --> 02:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
again and this was long before I was
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
involved with the
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislature so I I don't see this
 
02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
affecting people who
 
02:53:29.150 --> 02:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
legitimately call because they believe
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's abuse but I do see it affecting
 
02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
disgruntled acquaintance however they're
 
02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
acquainted to the particular person of
 
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
calling and continually giving false
 
02:53:50.229 --> 02:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
reports and that's why I think that this
 
02:53:52.469 --> 02:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
is an important
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to pass thank
 
02:53:58.510 --> 02:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
you live long please thank you Mr
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
chairman So currently you could file
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
with the court if somebody is
 
02:54:05.389 --> 02:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
maliciously saying that you're you're
 
02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
abusing or neglecting your child so this
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
does nothing to add to that
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh and what it does do
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
is as a as a as a you know as a required
 
02:54:21.550 --> 02:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
reporter we're all required reporters I
 
02:54:24.229 --> 02:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
I I believe that it'll it'll make people
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
think uh if this is if this is standing
 
02:54:29.750 --> 02:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward so this does not add more
 
02:54:32.670 --> 02:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement this does not fix the
 
02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
problem if the problem is still going to
 
02:54:36.870 --> 02:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
happen you're still going to have to go
 
02:54:40.349 --> 02:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
to court it's not up to the department
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they were
 
02:54:43.279 --> 02:54:46.510 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they were
malicious

02:54:46.510 --> 02:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman so I think
 
02:54:53.990 --> 02:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
I number one concern here is protecting
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
children at all costs now I understand
 
02:54:59.750 --> 02:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
that some people may call in false
 
02:55:02.429 --> 02:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
reports some people may call whether
 
02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're fearful or not and others may
 
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
not call in because they're fearful but
 
02:55:11.150 --> 02:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is are we concerned with
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
the convicting individuals for false
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
reports or are we concerned with
 
02:55:19.870 --> 02:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
protecting children at all costs and so
 
02:55:22.510 --> 02:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is let's protect the
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
children regardless of who's making the
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
phone call whether the calls are sincere
 
02:55:30.229 --> 02:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
and well- intended or whether or not
 
02:55:32.990 --> 02:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
their faults always best to air on the
 
02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
side of caution thank you professionally
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
over the years I've known several people
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
who were the victims of malicious false
 
02:55:45.710 --> 02:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
reporting and I sure want to protect
 
02:55:48.269 --> 02:55:48.279 align:start position:0%
them too so our hand this way
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative Panic then thank you
 
02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:52.550 align:start position:0%
representative Panic then thank you
chairman

02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
um on line number 12 through 17 it says
 
02:56:00.429 --> 02:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
reports made to the to the department
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
may include the name address and phone
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
number of the person or persons making
 
02:56:10.790 --> 02:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
the report so that would be a detriment
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
cuz right now you can send a report in
 
02:56:15.150 --> 02:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
you can put a report in and an Anonymous
 
02:56:17.790 --> 02:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
report and you have nowhere to go if it
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
seems to if it was a false report if
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
this person has to leave their name an
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
address and telephone number that's
 
02:56:26.429 --> 02:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a deterrent from them giving
 
02:56:28.349 --> 02:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
a false
 
02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
report but if it says may include they
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to oh that's the operative
 
02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
word in that sense so we need to change
 
02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
this to they shall well this is the
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
amendment we've got in front of us we
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
can't change it right now representative
 
02:56:45.150 --> 02:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
Perez yeah to be hon as this bill
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
concerns me if someone who is a Survivor
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
and someone who tried to report many
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
times and I know people try to report
 
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violent and Sh abuse this is
 
02:57:00.990 --> 02:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
concerning me when it comes
 
02:57:04.269 --> 02:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
to victims we not protect them victims
 
02:57:07.429 --> 02:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
we put them on the eyes of the abusers
 
02:57:10.750 --> 02:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
just to continue doing what they have
 
02:57:14.349 --> 02:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
done representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
02:57:17.830 --> 02:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um another perspective is that
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
when people make malicious reports it
 
02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
can separate families if it's pursued um
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
as though the report if if there if
 
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
there if it's pursued as though it's a
 
02:57:32.309 --> 02:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
real report it can cause harm to the
 
02:57:32.319 --> 02:57:33.870 align:start position:0%
real report it can cause harm to the
families

02:57:33.870 --> 02:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:57:37.750 --> 02:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
so one can look at the situation as
 
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
we're protecting the children if we're
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
if we're
 
02:57:45.309 --> 02:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
discouraging false reporting
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
and and to sorry to circle around to
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
representative panic's statement um you
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
can still according to the way this
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is written you can still
 
02:57:57.910 --> 02:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
report anonymously and we do want to
 
02:58:00.590 --> 02:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
protect that you're encouraged to give
 
02:58:02.590 --> 02:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
your information so they can Circle back
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
with you but you still have the right to
 
02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:06.469 align:start position:0%
with you but you still have the right to
be

02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
anonymous representative Bickford thank
 
02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:58:15.190 --> 02:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
chairman if I recall correctly I believe
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh attorney counselor etc etc Esquire
 
02:58:20.269 --> 02:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
Williams came in and spoke to us on this
 
02:58:24.670 --> 02:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
didn't he on this bill Drake ahead
 
02:58:28.070 --> 02:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
good and um told us that there wasn't
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
there was no issue over there at DCF
 
02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I understood this would not
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
go to dcyf but to law enforcement the
 
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
good counselor said quote it's a law
 
02:58:40.750 --> 02:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
enforce because it's being overused
 
02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the belief it's be
 
02:58:44.750 --> 02:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
someone's overusing
 
02:58:47.150 --> 02:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
this by making apparently a lot of phone
 
02:58:49.950 --> 02:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
calls and apparently not anonymously and
 
02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
so they're going to be charge it would
 
02:58:54.389 --> 02:58:54.399 align:start position:0%
have I feel it would have a chilling
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
effect I I did before um I was a student
 
02:59:01.950 --> 02:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
of uh Dr uh Mary Stewart guile who used
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be the chairman of this committee and
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
she insisted that where everyone was a
 
02:59:09.309 --> 02:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh when we made it that way I
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
was on the committee at the time that we
 
02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do this sort of thing and
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
because I thought the same thing I
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
thought we should we should do it and
 
02:59:20.590 --> 02:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
with there not a problem with PCF which
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
handles this
 
02:59:25.229 --> 02:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
stuff as being overburdened and
 
02:59:29.349 --> 02:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
everything I don't think it's necessary
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't really see people shouldn't
 
02:59:35.790 --> 02:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
be a victim of false reporting uh D DCF
 
02:59:37.469 --> 02:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
comes over knocks on your door and say
 
02:59:39.750 --> 02:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
can I talk to you and if there's nothing
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
there it's not a problem so they're not
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
really a victim of anything if they're
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
good actors and DC and dcyf is a good
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
actor too and of course we do believe
 
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
that during the hearing representative
 
02:59:52.680 --> 02:59:54.030 align:start position:0%
that during the hearing representative
McMahon

02:59:54.030 --> 02:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
McMahon
 
02:59:58.750 --> 02:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
asked uh director Jeff fer of DCF do we
 
02:59:59.950 --> 02:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
need this
 
03:00:03.550 --> 03:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
bill Mr fer said yes we
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
do I think that was that was during the
 
03:00:09.469 --> 03:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
hearing sometime John John William came
 
03:00:11.870 --> 03:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
back and said that was an error yeah I
 
03:00:14.190 --> 03:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
got right I got Mr flesher and Mr
 
03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.870 --> 03:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.670 --> 03:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:32.349 --> 03:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
discussions okay so uh that one ended in
 
03:00:32.359 --> 03:00:35.190 align:start position:0%
discussions okay so uh that one ended in
a

03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:39.750 --> 03:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
tie anyone else representative
 
03:00:42.429 --> 03:00:42.439 align:start position:0%
Kap so assuming that we're going to take
 
03:00:44.349 --> 03:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
lunch at some point I know noticed that
 
03:00:47.190 --> 03:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
rep Raymond mentioned that she liked the
 
03:00:48.750 --> 03:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the amendment except she
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
didn't like the fact that it wasn't
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
saying that it didn't have if you failed
 
03:00:56.950 --> 03:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
to report in as a professional
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
reporter if so perhaps if we're taking
 
03:01:01.790 --> 03:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
lunch we could ask OLS to make that
 
03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
change if that would then make her
 
03:01:05.950 --> 03:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
supportive of
 
03:01:10.229 --> 03:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
the I Mr chairman if I may respond yes
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
um that is an issue that I have with the
 
03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:14.469 align:start position:0%
um that is an issue that I have with the
amendment

03:01:14.469 --> 03:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:01:16.830 --> 03:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciated the attempt to
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
address my question at the at the
 
03:01:19.359 --> 03:01:21.190 align:start position:0%
address my question at the at the
hearing

03:01:21.190 --> 03:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:01:26.269 --> 03:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
um however I still feel very strongly
 
03:01:30.429 --> 03:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
that um there are ways of handling
 
03:01:34.229 --> 03:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
people who are using DCF as a weapon uh
 
03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
that don't require this type of
 
03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislative solution and I in my
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
experience and like I said I worked in a
 
03:01:45.190 --> 03:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
state um as a worker who where there was
 
03:01:46.910 --> 03:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
a law like this and I've worked here
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
where there isn't um and in both
 
03:01:52.990 --> 03:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
cases the majority of the false reports
 
03:01:56.309 --> 03:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
or using DCF to harass someone is in a
 
03:01:58.750 --> 03:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
high complect domestic violence
 
03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
situation and this bill I don't believe
 
03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
will have any impact on that whatsoever
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
because in those high conflict domestic
 
03:02:08.670 --> 03:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
violence situations it's about power and
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
control and that person is going to
 
03:02:12.349 --> 03:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
utilize whatever tools they have at
 
03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
their disposal and I have never seen in
 
03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
my professional experience anyone
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for calling too much because
 
03:02:23.309 --> 03:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to say that a parent
 
03:02:25.870 --> 03:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a genuine concern about the
 
03:02:27.950 --> 03:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
safety of their child even when you know
 
03:02:29.710 --> 03:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
that that parent has a history of
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and inappropriate
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
behavior to the other parent you it's I
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
the only case I've ever seen prosecuted
 
03:02:40.950 --> 03:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
for for FAL for was a fail to report by
 
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
a school guidance counselor I've never
 
03:02:45.229 --> 03:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
seen anybody part prosecuted in New York
 
03:02:47.429 --> 03:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
either for calling repeatedly on their
 
03:02:49.269 --> 03:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
neighbor or calling repeatedly on their
 
03:02:52.910 --> 03:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
ex um we as a worker you go out and say
 
03:02:54.269 --> 03:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
listen if you keep this up we are going
 
03:02:56.110 --> 03:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
to send the police out to talk to you
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
but that's like the most I've ever seen
 
03:03:00.429 --> 03:03:00.439 align:start position:0%
have happen so representative
 
03:03:03.750 --> 03:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbons thank you Mr chairman um the
 
03:03:05.469 --> 03:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
other side of that though is that you
 
03:03:06.990 --> 03:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
were working in another state that had
 
03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
this law on the books and it there's the
 
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
potential that it deterred the that type
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
of behavior
 
03:03:17.469 --> 03:03:17.479 align:start position:0%
meaning you didn't see it prosecuted
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
because people the because the the the
 
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
affected we have before us the amendment
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
0245 it is a replace the entire Bill
 
03:03:40.229 --> 03:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
kind of amendment if this amendment uh
 
03:03:43.070 --> 03:03:43.080 align:start position:0%

proceedings um parties to record
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings that are in an open um open
 
04:06:41.309 --> 04:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.189 --> 04:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
anybody remember this goes back to
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes the court recordings are cut
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
off and through some of the work we did
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
with the special committee on the Family
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
Division of the Circuit Court we found
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
out that that um does happen sometimes
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
because of Machinery okay and uh parties
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
who are litigating prosay may want to
 
04:07:16.750 --> 04:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
remember what they actually said in did
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
previous bills on this were way too
 
04:07:20.349 --> 04:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
broad in
 
04:07:24.910 --> 04:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
scope um some of the problems that arose
 
04:07:28.349 --> 04:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
in previous bills are fixed in line 10
 
04:07:30.830 --> 04:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
and following electronic recording or
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
transmission of private communication of
 
04:07:35.070 --> 04:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
others including bench and sidebar
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
conferences conferences between Council
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
conferences between councel and client
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
are prohibited this is what the judges
 
04:07:47.070 --> 04:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
said has to be and it makes sense to us
 
04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
um so this just broadens on behalf of um
 
04:07:57.630 --> 04:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
many people we heard who were in Family
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
Court who felt this would be an
 
04:08:02.149 --> 04:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
advantage the question is can it be done
 
04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
in such a way that is not disruptive and
 
04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion the the bill deals with
 
04:08:10.950 --> 04:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
both of those anybody
 
04:08:13.710 --> 04:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
kab thank you Mr chairman I Echo much of
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
what you just said and I did want to add
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
that there was a similar bill that was
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
put in the year before last year and it
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
passed the house on 20 to0 consent and
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
then it got over to the Senate and there
 
04:08:30.429 --> 04:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
was concern about recording of private
 
04:08:32.590 --> 04:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
sidebar conversations and whatnot so I
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
did explicitly add that into this bill
 
04:08:37.630 --> 04:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that there was kind of
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
and no
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
other potential things I do want to
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
point out that when something is open to
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:08:48.189 --> 04:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
the anybody from the public can go in
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
and get a copy of the reporting these
 
04:08:51.070 --> 04:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
are hearings that are open up to the
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
public however as you said we got
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
comments that sometimes the the
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
recording equipment was accidentally
 
04:09:00.990 --> 04:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
being turned off so uh there shouldn't
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
be any concern about privacy here
 
04:09:04.710 --> 04:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
because these are open to the public and
 
04:09:07.109 --> 04:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
anybody can the next day go into the
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
court and get what the court has
 
04:09:10.349 --> 04:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
available for recordings this is just
 
04:09:12.030 --> 04:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
simply making sure that if the court
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
equipment fails the person has their own
 
04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
recording that's all thank you thank you
 
04:09:18.590 --> 04:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else saw another hand down this
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
way did I I did representative Raymond
 
04:09:25.630 --> 04:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I am actually opposed to
 
04:09:29.790 --> 04:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
this bill um I appreciate that um care
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
was taken in crafting it for making sure
 
04:09:34.030 --> 04:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
that this isn't going to violate any
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
privacy issues that these are already
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
open hearing so that leaves some of my
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
concern that I had over the last version
 
04:09:42.349 --> 04:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
of it that you know I kids deserve
 
04:09:44.670 --> 04:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
privacy um and so I appreciate that
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
we're protecting them um my question is
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
question my concern with the bill is
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
about um chain of custody it for me
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's one thing to make a recording
 
04:10:01.469 --> 04:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
for your own private you know personal
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
recollection you need to refresh your
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
recollection of what happened you can't
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
get the recording from court for some
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
reason um you don't want to pay you have
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
it however um to introduce a recording
 
04:10:14.349 --> 04:10:14.359 align:start position:0%
that someone has made on their own
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
personal recording device with no
 
04:10:18.429 --> 04:10:18.439 align:start position:0%
history of what happened in an appeal or
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
something else I think is a slippery
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
slope where it is not possible to
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
determine you know what kind of editing
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
has been done to these recordings um I
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
also am very sensitive uh to domestic
 
04:10:34.349 --> 04:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
violence situations and cases where
 
04:10:36.269 --> 04:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
someone might take their own personal
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
recording cut in and splice it and on
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
because it's theirs they can do what
 
04:10:42.189 --> 04:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
they want on it and post it on social
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
media and use it to harass or um
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise um try to control and exploit
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um an ex for whom they they have
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
contempt and I
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
just for those two reasons the the chain
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
of custody issue and the the potential
 
04:11:01.710 --> 04:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence I just can't
 
04:11:01.720 --> 04:11:02.590 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence I just can't
support

04:11:02.590 --> 04:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
it representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%

04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh um legal
 
04:11:18.109 --> 04:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
assistance uh says that they are opposed
 
04:11:20.830 --> 04:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
to the bill because you can already
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
record the proceeding you just need
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
prior permission from the court uh so
 
04:11:30.149 --> 04:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where this bill is
 
04:11:34.309 --> 04:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
necessary um and and I can confirm that
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
it is written on the on the judicial
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
branch website in the court rules that
 
04:11:43.469 --> 04:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to to uh record because
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
I read it on there before with
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
permission yes okay if that being the
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
case I I personally am not opposed to
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
passing a law that just underscores
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
what's already there I do that across
 
04:11:58.109 --> 04:11:58.119 align:start position:0%
the ideological Spectrum I tend to be
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
more as better uh representative katab
 
04:12:03.070 --> 04:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're the prime so how would you answer
 
04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you so to respond to both
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
kind of things that were said one this
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say that this is admissible
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
or can otherwise be used in court this
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
just says that you could make a
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
recording it doesn't in any way say that
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's admissible or that you can use it
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
to create transcripts um regarding that
 
04:12:21.070 --> 04:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
yes you can already do it if you put in
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
notice in advance but we heard from some
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
people you know that if something's
 
04:12:26.950 --> 04:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
going away that they didn't expect it to
 
04:12:28.349 --> 04:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
go and suddenly in the middle they're
 
04:12:30.750 --> 04:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
like they're their prosay by themselves
 
04:12:32.109 --> 04:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to record it just
 
04:12:34.830 --> 04:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
to for their own I didn't expect this to
 
04:12:36.510 --> 04:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
happen I I now want a copy and they
 
04:12:38.590 --> 04:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
didn't for for see needing a copy in
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
advance so they didn't ask for
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
permission in advance I just you know if
 
04:12:44.670 --> 04:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's your part if you're part of the
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
proceeding I just think you should be
 
04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
able to record it but um in terms of
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
like the comment on splicing I mean
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
somebody could do that with the Court's
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
copy as well so I don't think that this
 
04:12:54.429 --> 04:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
is going to change either of those
 
04:12:55.950 --> 04:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
things I think this is just allowing
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
somebody to have their own personal copy
 
04:13:01.389 --> 04:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
of of their hearing that they're a part
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
of Representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
04:13:06.429 --> 04:13:06.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and I do appreciate uh
 
04:13:10.189 --> 04:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
representative tabs take on it where you
 
04:13:13.229 --> 04:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
might decide that you need a recording
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
prior to or sorry after or during your
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and so if you lost the
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
record uh sorry to to to request to be
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
able to record you might still want that
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
Avenue open um that opens up to my next
 
04:13:33.600 --> 04:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
Avenue open um that opens up to my next
question

04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:13:39.070 --> 04:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire uh legal assistance
 
04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes this bill raises concerns
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
about how the Supreme Court will decide
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
which recording to rely upon for
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
appealed cases so I wonder if we should
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
amend this to say that the courts
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
because this would address not only
 
04:13:59.830 --> 04:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn's point but also uh
 
04:14:03.070 --> 04:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Raymond's point where
 
04:14:04.990 --> 04:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned about that editing
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
might happen and how uh uh evidence
 
04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
might be tampered with if if multiple
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
parties can record then we should make a
 
04:14:20.830 --> 04:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
a caveat saying that only the Court's
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
recording is admissible for
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
appeals and so would would we be open to
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
amending it to put that in
 
04:14:29.279 --> 04:14:31.870 align:start position:0%
amending it to put that in
representative

04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
katab thank you for the question thank
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
you for recognizing me thank you for the
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
question you know I think
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
if for some reason the Court's equipment
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
had failed to pick up something that was
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
important I think the court you know
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's the court is has the the ability
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
to decide if something has otherwise
 
04:14:52.229 --> 04:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
been tampered with or potentially you
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
know if if again their recording
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
equipment failed for a certain period of
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
time I think you can be able to tell a
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
lot of these things based on the fact
 
04:15:00.910 --> 04:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
that you know if the hearing you know
 
04:15:04.469 --> 04:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
opened at 10:1 p.m. and ended at you
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
know 1 uh at 2:1 p.m. and we only have
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
49 minutes of recording that obviously
 
04:15:11.870 --> 04:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
that there was something missing there
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
you know and I mean there are obviously
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
laws on the books about falsifying or
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
submitting false things so I just I
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
really don't foresee that that
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily happening and I think the
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
court can decide rather to accept the
 
04:15:25.189 --> 04:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
evidence or not nothing is saying that
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
this would be accepted or would be
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
admissible I think that I wouldn't want
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
to T tie a judge's hands one way or the
 
04:15:33.269 --> 04:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
other I think the judges can decide
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not to accept something and
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
certainly typically
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're going by transcripts that are
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
kind of coming out so if somebody
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
disagrees or says that something's
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
missing in there and asks the court hey
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
can you look into this I think there are
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
plenty of ways of of verifying if a
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
recording's been tampered with or not I
 
04:15:52.750 --> 04:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
mean look at CNN going through and Geo
 
04:15:54.990 --> 04:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
GE locating exactly time and dates of
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
things that happen
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
so uh representative
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you I have a two-part
 
04:16:03.070 --> 04:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
question is that okay can I just ask for
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
a followup okay thanks so on the elri
 
04:16:09.389 --> 04:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
iic recording or transmission of private
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
communication of others including bench
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
sidebar conferences so we've already
 
04:16:15.550 --> 04:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
Unleashed them to be able to record
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
who's going to monitor the fact that
 
04:16:18.429 --> 04:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
they're then turning it off if there's
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
like a sidebar because I mean they're
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
recording devices now they can pick up
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
pretty far so so how is that going to
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
get policed because that's obviously a
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
big uh who's to say you can't do that
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
now if indeed it is elicit to do such
 
04:16:34.510 --> 04:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
how's that happen but you have to have
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
permission so a lot of times when the
 
04:16:40.030 --> 04:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
judge is giving permission he knows then
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
who's recording and he can say you need
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
to turn that off right now and he can
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
observe that he or she I shouldn't I
 
04:16:48.030 --> 04:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
should not there were women judges now
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
there there are that so
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
um that's one thing I mean I I I have
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
great respect for um for this bill I
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
understand the reasoning we certainly
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
have heard things I also have a great
 
04:17:01.149 --> 04:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
respect for our judicial system and the
 
04:17:04.229 --> 04:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
judge's ability to um mandate over their
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
own court and they certainly should have
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
that uh position to be able to make the
 
04:17:12.630 --> 04:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
decision whether or not somebody should
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
be able to record because we've seen in
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
real time somebody record their
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
proceedings and then use it as a weapon
 
04:17:20.670 --> 04:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
and post it online that's been that's
 
04:17:22.269 --> 04:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
been a problem and whether or not the
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
judge has known that is something else
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
or but the judge should have the ability
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
to control their own court room in that
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
um as far as who you know the behaviors
 
04:17:35.429 --> 04:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
and that kind of stuff to help keep you
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
know some kind of control over a very
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know very volatile situations that's
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
why I will not be supporting this
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
Gibbons okay representative L uh thank
 
04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just with respect to the
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh line six the recording devices
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
used by the Pary does not interfere with
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
the proceedings is that exclusively on

the proceedings is that exclusively on
the

04:18:01.149 --> 04:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
judge do we can we assume that it is
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:09.950 align:start position:0%
judge do we can we assume that it is
okay

04:18:09.950 --> 04:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:09.960 --> 04:18:11.189 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
else representative Bickford thank you
 
04:18:17.550 --> 04:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I uh I don't think I have
 
04:18:19.469 --> 04:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
any problem with the bill because it
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much matches what I think goes on
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
now I'm not sure why we need it but it
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
is nice to tell people what they can do
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes as long as a judge uh can make
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the decisions and this bill it doesn't
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
look like it supersedes anything that
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
the court already has in place so I I I
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't see any damage by
 
04:18:42.269 --> 04:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
it that's my Spiel oh and and I I heard
 
04:18:43.870 --> 04:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
about domestic violence
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
being uh I aren't those aren't those are
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
those proceedings uh closed or they
 
04:18:54.269 --> 04:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
open I thought they were cold but I I
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
lately representative Greg so in a
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
divorce proceedings that's where you're
 
04:19:02.590 --> 04:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
going to domestic violence can come up
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
right that's not a criminal trial so
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
there can be there many times there are
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of manipulations especially within
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
prosay and stuff with domestic violence
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
you see that in family courts very very
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
often and um weaponizing in a particular
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
happened representative long yeah just
 
04:19:26.750 --> 04:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh for clarification currently uh you
 
04:19:29.550 --> 04:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
need permission from the judge this bill
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
says you shall be able to so you don't
 
04:19:35.309 --> 04:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
need permission from the judge oh really
 
04:19:36.990 --> 04:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
right is that correct mhm but I thought
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
the last um it does the last paragraph
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
cleared that up I thought where have I
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.109 --> 04:19:52.119 align:start position:0%
it nothing in the section shall prohibit
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
a party or non-party who is otherwise
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
authorized by law or court order to
 
04:20:00.189 --> 04:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
record proceedings from doing
 
04:20:02.950 --> 04:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
so so doesn't that kind of flip it the
 
04:20:02.960 --> 04:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
so so doesn't that kind of flip it the
other

04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.560 --> 04:20:10.510 align:start position:0%
 
way

04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative kab I think it's the
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
judge still has the the discre because
 
04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
it does say that you know it can't be
 
04:20:18.269 --> 04:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
interfering with the proceeding which
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
would be at the discretion of the judge
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
so I think the Judge would still have
 
04:20:24.189 --> 04:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
the ability if for whatever reason they
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
felt that it's interfering with the
 
04:20:27.389 --> 04:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
proceeding to to be able
 
04:20:31.830 --> 04:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
person the fact that about 85% of the
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
litigant in Family Court are
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
prosay um and if their hearing is
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
continued and they're wondering what did
 
04:20:51.269 --> 04:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
I say what did the other side say I
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what to look for with the
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of a lawyer I need to go back
 
04:20:58.990 --> 04:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
and listen what anybody remember what I
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
said or what they said this gives that
 
04:21:04.910 --> 04:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh when we were taking lots
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
of hearings on Family Court even
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
allowing for people arguing out of anger
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
because they lost the case even allowing
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
that um it just sounded like there were
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
too many instances where certain judges
 
04:21:24.870 --> 04:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
really didn't want any recordings done
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
and that seemed to me a violation of
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
people's rights that even as I say
 
04:21:34.590 --> 04:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
discounting a lot of disgruntled people
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
it sounded like certain one
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
did not give permission all that often
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
this gives to me a civil right to the
 
04:21:43.239 --> 04:21:44.510 align:start position:0%
this gives to me a civil right to the
prosay

04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
prosay
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%

or is that the recording the audio
 
04:22:13.349 --> 04:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
recording I would expect it to be the
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%

line 18 line 18 in the bill has
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%

violence okay
 
04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and the other change and the other
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:27:37.030 --> 04:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
the other change is with respect to the
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
um if the parties object to the
 
04:27:45.870 --> 04:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
appointment actually line 13 on the
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
amendment if the party objects to the
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%

04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
different person within seven days after
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
the date of the party's
 
04:28:00.269 --> 04:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
objection and uh in the original
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
which it takes out the words or confirms
 
04:28:06.429 --> 04:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
correct confirm
 
04:28:07.950 --> 04:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
yeah those those are the only two
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
changes to the original bill I recall
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
these were the two issues we had when we
 
04:28:15.790 --> 04:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
heard the bill yeah originally all right
 
04:28:18.389 --> 04:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the part of Representative
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
long is being played by um
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions uh for the vice
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.149 --> 04:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
this yes representative
 
04:28:34.269 --> 04:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
04:28:36.510 --> 04:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
have a question what happens cuz my
 
04:28:37.990 --> 04:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
one one uh person who does this right
 
04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
now in the state um so what happens if
 
04:28:46.910 --> 04:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a second person or do we
 
04:28:49.950 --> 04:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
pass the law first and then hope that
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
courts then now create these positions I
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
I guess that's I'm just
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
worried because I I like the idea I
 
04:29:00.189 --> 04:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
really like the idea I just do we need
 
04:29:01.710 --> 04:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure first or we do the law
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
first and then infrastructure comes
 
04:29:08.109 --> 04:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
after well sometimes the law nudges
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
people to put in place what the law
 
04:29:10.199 --> 04:29:13.149 align:start position:0%
people to put in place what the law
tells

04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
tells
 
04:29:13.159 --> 04:29:18.229 align:start position:0%
tells
so

04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so I mean I can respond to
 
04:29:24.030 --> 04:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
that if you please do um so there is one
 
04:29:26.109 --> 04:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
person in nashwa that we've heard that
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
is doing this currently our
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
understanding though in testimony is
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
that um uh because it's not just
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh other professionals that
 
04:29:39.109 --> 04:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
they would step up to do this so that's
 
04:29:41.229 --> 04:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
the hopes that uh there will
 
04:29:44.910 --> 04:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
be more circuit courts utilizing this uh
 
04:29:47.070 --> 04:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
you know we heard in testimony that that
 
04:29:50.590 --> 04:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
works great in high conflict um
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
situations um so we're hoping that
 
04:29:56.109 --> 04:29:56.119 align:start position:0%
professionals will step up to do this
 
04:29:56.119 --> 04:29:58.590 align:start position:0%
professionals will step up to do this
this

04:29:58.590 --> 04:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
mediation okay thank you anyone else
 
04:30:05.950 --> 04:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
04:30:08.109 --> 04:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
chairman um also with there being a
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached they could just
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
they could appropriate funds for for
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
more uh positions of parenting
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
coordinators if they needed
 
04:30:30.269 --> 04:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
believe representative
 
04:30:35.109 --> 04:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
Greg yes so one of the things in our
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
special committee that we kind of
 
04:30:39.070 --> 04:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
listened to and that we've saw we saw
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
within the courts too was um our Gala
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
has been a a great resource however one
 
04:30:46.750 --> 04:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the I probably biggest disservices we
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
did was not funding that anymore because
 
04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of our Indigent
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
families that could really use this now
 
04:30:54.389 --> 04:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
what this does is not only brings
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
another aspect where we have other areas
 
04:30:59.109 --> 04:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
of expertise besides law um and training
 
04:31:01.710 --> 04:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
to help with um you know helping to get
 
04:31:04.269 --> 04:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
the parents uh some kind of you know
 
04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
help um by doing this but also it
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
provides that maybe the um mediation
 
04:31:12.429 --> 04:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
fund and such could be used now this
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
isn't I don't think this is necessarily
 
04:31:16.229 --> 04:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
a perfect bill but I think it's a great
 
04:31:18.269 --> 04:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction as far as
 
04:31:21.389 --> 04:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
helping the families that need it the
 
04:31:25.389 --> 04:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
most which is why you were a co-sponsor
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%

04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
04488 bearing the names of Greg and
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.199 --> 04:35:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
side

04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
and one or indeed any may move the
 
04:35:15.869 --> 04:35:15.879 align:start position:0%
amendment actually representative kab
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
cannot but representative Greg
 
04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
can yes um I just move to adopt the
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment well that's what I'm
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
doing move to adopt the amendment
 
04:35:35.230 --> 04:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
0448 H for uh one for 106 is this
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
because you had a Dr Pepper for lunch
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's because I shove my food down so
 
04:35:40.510 --> 04:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
quick my body's like whoa what are we
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
doing but you've recovered well doing my
 
04:35:46.990 --> 04:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
best who'd like to
 
04:35:54.029 --> 04:35:54.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
do and now representative Greg or katab
 
04:36:06.750 --> 04:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
could tell us what the amendment does
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay so on the original we talked about
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
um visitation and uh custody or
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
visitation we changed it all to just
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
parenting time so you'll see um you know
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
relative to just parenting time in uh
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
representative kab's uh conversation
 
04:36:23.949 --> 04:36:23.959 align:start position:0%
conversations with judge
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
king um this seemed much more doable as
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
far as the courts we certainly don't
 
04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
want to backlog the courts or anything
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
but we also want these parenting
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
situations like this to be handled
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
quickly before children are without
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
their parents for months so this is only
 
04:36:46.189 --> 04:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:08.949 align:start position:0%
 
else

04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.269 --> 04:37:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative oh I I I'll get there
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
um Gibbons thank you to my friend I
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
would like to make a
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
motion oh we do sorry okay never mind
 
04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
sorry well you might like to but there's
 
04:37:23.709 --> 04:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
already one on the floor dear okay then
 
04:37:26.109 --> 04:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
I will you like that one do you yes okay
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
you can vote Yes in a minute then if you
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:58.429 --> 04:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
so the fact that it amends it replaces
 
04:38:01.869 --> 04:38:01.879 align:start position:0%
section one as I look at the original
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
Bill section two is just the
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
of taking effect so that doesn't change
 
04:38:11.310 --> 04:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
and as I'm trying to do a side by side
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
here I don't see a whole heck of a lot
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
of difference between the bill the bill
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
and its Origins and the amendment could
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
somebody Point me out a few lines
 
04:38:24.551 --> 04:38:24.561 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you sure so on
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
um the first main line where it says in
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the event of
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
non-compliance so after the comma after
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
under this chapter comma instead of
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
including we Chang that to relative to
 
04:38:37.709 --> 04:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
and then denying or interfering with and
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
where it says visitation we've taken
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
that out and put parenting time um
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
instead of visitation so also down on
 
04:38:49.150 --> 04:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
part four letter A A compens A I'm not
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
even going to pronounce that word right
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
now so instead of visitation we have
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
parenting time so custody or visitation
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
has all been changed to Parenting Time
 
04:39:00.629 --> 04:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
on line four so this is only dealing
 
04:39:02.349 --> 04:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
with parenting time okay if we had to
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
deal with all the others it would be
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
problem for the courts
 
04:39:08.949 --> 04:39:08.959 align:start position:0%
and everything else is the same that's
 
04:39:14.709 --> 04:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
is yeah it looks very nice thank you it
 
04:39:22.230 --> 04:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's cute yeah that's a computer right
 
04:39:24.029 --> 04:39:24.039 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
there anybody
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
else representative bigford I think it's
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
pretty minor but um on line 18
 
04:39:37.030 --> 04:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
20 it uh brings back visitation in
 
04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
rather than parenting
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
time say what that was something I
 
04:39:45.920 --> 04:39:46.910 align:start position:0%
time say what that was something I
pointed

04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
pointed
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
out for the
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that's the only thing I see I
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
don't even see that what do you see tell
 
04:39:57.550 --> 04:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
me again of the bill or the amendment
 
04:40:00.270 --> 04:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
compens the amendment 20 on the
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
amendment L 20 okay it has the word
 
04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:13.150 align:start position:0%
amendment L 20 okay it has the word
visitation

04:40:13.150 --> 04:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
both so it should say parenting time
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:22.080 --> 04:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
somewhere

04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
if yeah you might be right now this can
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
be fixed I mean we can go forward how do
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
we sometimes in enrolled bills or
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
something I mean isn't there a funny
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
little process where they can fix their
 
04:40:36.878 --> 04:40:40.708 align:start position:0%
little process where they can fix their
error

04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.718 --> 04:40:44.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:40:44.670 --> 04:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.628 --> 04:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I think um yeah go ahead if we have
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
a few more bills I might be able to call
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
Os in the meantime and just ask if they
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
could fix because we did put it in our
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
red line for them to fix and they just
 
04:40:58.830 --> 04:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
missed it so if they could just expedite
 
04:41:01.590 --> 04:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
fixing it and give it to us if you want
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
to recess this and go on since we have
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
other bills can recess this sure um if
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
you want to give them a call I promise
 
04:41:11.550 --> 04:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
not to have any fun here while you're
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
out doing that and tell them to do that
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
and please then when it's done you got
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
to muscle it over to the fourth floor
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
which does something with it and it
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
comes down here and I've seen that done
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%

FN um which is establishing a separate
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
department of children youth and famili
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
separating dcyf out of D
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
HHS and the chair moves
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
itl and I'll speak to my
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second if you need a second
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we got to do that don't we who
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
who was that Raymond yeah okay sorry I
 
04:45:16.910 --> 04:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
spoke out of turn Mr chairman no that's
 
04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
fine no that that
 
04:45:18.760 --> 04:45:21.350 align:start position:0%
fine no that that
that's

04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:45:25.750 --> 04:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
good uh it Pearson and Raymond we're
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
good all right here's the
 
04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
deal there is simply nothing to be
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
gained by separating out dcyf from DHHS
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
and there's a few few things to
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
lose much of the testimony on this bill
 
04:45:42.270 --> 04:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
by representative H concerned needed
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
improvements in DCF such as
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
accessibility transparency and
 
04:45:50.110 --> 04:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
accountability and you may recall at
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
that point I said those are wonderful
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
things but first they're already working
 
04:45:58.150 --> 04:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
on them and secondly doesn't matter
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
whether DCF is independent or not
 
04:46:02.110 --> 04:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
they're still going to be working on
 
04:46:04.350 --> 04:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
them so much of his testimony was
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful but not really relevant to the
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
motion of the bill after years of
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
seeming mismanagement and public
 
04:46:16.270 --> 04:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
outrage the present director's
 
04:46:19.430 --> 04:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
predecessor uh Joe ribson was brought in
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
to clean things up the measures he took
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
are now being enhanced by the present
 
04:46:26.430 --> 04:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
director we saw him this morning uh Jeff
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
fer who hudly acknowledges the needs
 
04:46:32.270 --> 04:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the testimony for further
 
04:46:34.270 --> 04:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
improvements and this is demonstrated
 
04:46:37.548 --> 04:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
ated by his continual work on them this
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
work will continue and it does not need
 
04:46:44.190 --> 04:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
dcf's Detachment from DHHS for this to
 
04:46:44.200 --> 04:46:45.830 align:start position:0%
dcf's Detachment from DHHS for this to
happen

04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
DCF regularly makes reports to the
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
children's oversight committee and since
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's under DHHS it periodically makes
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
reports to the
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS oversight committee which I chair
 
04:47:03.548 --> 04:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
the office of the child advocate
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
regularly works with DCF the special
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family Division of the
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court which I also chair learned
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
the regularity with which Family Court
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
intersects with
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
DCF Casa works with
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
DCF dcf's director regularly attends
 
04:47:27.670 --> 04:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
meetings of the governor and councel and
 
04:47:27.680 --> 04:47:28.548 align:start position:0%
meetings of the governor and councel and
there's

04:47:28.548 --> 04:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
more the director regularly gets calls
 
04:47:33.310 --> 04:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
on his cell phone and passes them along
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
to his staff for followup besides such
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
constituent relations the director
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
regularly leaves his office to meet with
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
various stakeholder groups I've asked
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
and he's named some again this work will
 
04:47:50.750 --> 04:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
continue and it does not need DCS
 
04:47:54.510 --> 04:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
Detachment from DHHS for this to happen
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of other states Place
 
04:47:57.840 --> 04:47:58.750 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of other states Place
their

04:47:58.750 --> 04:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
DCFS under their Departments of Health
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to do the work of
 
04:48:08.430 --> 04:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
separating out DCF and DHHS would
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
require a considerable amount of money
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
for no other apparent gain than just
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
separating and this is money better
 
04:48:18.910 --> 04:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
spent in further strengthening and
 
04:48:20.990 --> 04:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
enhancing the staff at
 
04:48:24.430 --> 04:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
DCF and make more difficult the
 
04:48:29.070 --> 04:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
Synergy staff sharing and data system
 
04:48:34.590 --> 04:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
syncretization now enjoyed by DCF being
 
04:48:34.600 --> 04:48:36.070 align:start position:0%
syncretization now enjoyed by DCF being
in

04:48:36.070 --> 04:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS and this is true in many other
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
states and it is true here in New
 
04:48:41.320 --> 04:48:42.948 align:start position:0%
states and it is true here in New
Hampshire

04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
so that's my motion and
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%

04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
note but it's dead so can it go on
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
consent what if it's
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
overturned right it doesn't go anywhere

overturned right it doesn't go anywhere
now

04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:50:08.190 --> 04:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
all right any objection to consent if it
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
can be on
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%

pending approvals of higher Ops there is
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note on that yeah but it's not
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
going to a second committee because it

you yeah we'll find that out and if it
 
04:50:34.270 --> 04:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
has to go on to consent uh off consent
 
04:50:38.110 --> 04:50:38.120 align:start position:0%
it'll go off consent and this ends the
 
04:50:38.120 --> 04:50:39.110 align:start position:0%
it'll go off consent and this ends the
hearing

04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.868 --> 04:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
microphone uh the sponsor says there's
 
04:51:58.270 --> 04:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
no amendment huh the sponsor told me
 
04:52:01.670 --> 04:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
there is no Amendment coming from
 
04:52:06.190 --> 04:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm I'm up in the air on the
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
the bill um and yet you second it it
 
04:52:14.910 --> 04:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
is well it's just the driver's license
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
as I recall um I think it's a a very
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
Draconian move to do such a thing as
 
04:52:22.510 --> 04:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
that I was here in 19 I think it was
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
1995 when this passed along with hunting
 
04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
licenses fishing game you know that sort
 
04:52:31.070 --> 04:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
of thing um and I've always been uh
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to it because we don't collect
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
money from anybody else in the the same
 
04:52:36.390 --> 04:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
manner and I always said everything
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to be on the same level
 
04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
I I especially know that because I've
 
04:52:42.430 --> 04:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
lent money to people and had a chase
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
after it and I really would have loved
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to take their driver's
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
license away from them to get that money
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
back uh especially when I my daughters
 
04:52:51.080 --> 04:52:52.110 align:start position:0%
back uh especially when I my daughters
needed

04:52:52.110 --> 04:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
braces uh so I think we should all be in
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the same uh playing field as far as
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
collections it just doesn't make sense
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
are you arguing against the motion you
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
just made huh are you arguing against
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
the motion you just
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
made okay what did I no you seconded the
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
OTP and you're arguing itl I'm just want
 
04:53:15.920 --> 04:53:16.910 align:start position:0%
OTP and you're arguing itl I'm just want
to

04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
clarify you're not are you for or
 
04:53:21.788 --> 04:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
against Bill for the bill it's it's
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
about stopping from taking driver's
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.948 --> 04:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
reason that's scary I thought I had you
 
04:53:39.628 --> 04:53:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.470 --> 04:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
you want me start
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
over really you would like an amendment
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
that would Grant you permission to take
 
04:53:49.390 --> 04:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
people's driver's licenses away who owe
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
you money I I I do not want driver
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
license taken because and my reasoning
 
04:53:57.390 --> 04:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
is because no other place in society
 
04:53:59.708 --> 04:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
that I know of do we take Driver's away
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
people for owing somebody money and I'm
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
saying I would have loved to have that
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
for myself to collect money from anybody
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
because you know what I've had kids who
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
support you know or pay for
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
braces um on the other hand the my my
 
04:54:19.390 --> 04:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
question is what is the cost of this and
 
04:54:22.548 --> 04:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
maybe that's only for um finance
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
committee I don't know but the feds may
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
come down on us heavy I don't know when
 
04:54:29.230 --> 04:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
when Susan bristen spoke to this the
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
other day she said well there are ways
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
of doing it softly maybe that was word
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh and but I and that's really what I
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
expected for an amendment but I really
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
want to get at least a discussion on it
 
04:54:41.948 --> 04:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
and maybe get more information so that's
 
04:54:44.750 --> 04:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
why I agreed to Second
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
it okay anybody
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman so I also
 
04:54:55.788 --> 04:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
had written down uh I think what what
 
04:54:57.868 --> 04:54:57.878 align:start position:0%
representative Beckford was referring to
 
04:55:01.628 --> 04:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
I have a note um from um I think it was
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
attorney Brens who had spoken to us
 
04:55:06.310 --> 04:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
that if we pass
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
this uh it might impact our tan block
 
04:55:13.830 --> 04:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
grant um because other states have other
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
states have exceptions but they don't
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
have nothing right and so I'm concerned
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
if we pass it without without any kind
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
of amendment that would give us
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions like what other states do
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
that it might impact our tan of block
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
grant which will impact significant
 
04:55:32.830 --> 04:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
funding um for a lot of our programs
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
including child
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
support and I know I I Googled and I got
 
04:55:42.150 --> 04:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
nothing so maybe we could does does
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
everybody have this Memo from a
 
04:55:47.470 --> 04:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
committee researcher because it outlines
 
04:55:51.390 --> 04:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
what other states do and I see some
 
04:55:54.670 --> 04:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
states have um
 
04:56:00.868 --> 04:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:02.910 --> 04:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
don't and I don't know if they're
 
04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
withheld it is a research project dated
 
04:56:13.360 --> 04:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
withheld it is a research project dated
February

04:56:23.030 --> 04:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
1st so Mr chairman yes but I didn't see
 
04:56:30.670 --> 04:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
on and I did read this I didn't see that
 
04:56:33.868 --> 04:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
there were any states
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
that just said a blanket were no longer
 
04:56:39.910 --> 04:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to uh impact the driver's license
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
what I saw was all of the states have
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
some impact to Driver's Licenses based
 
04:56:47.788 --> 04:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
on non-compliance and that if we pass
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
this we would be the one state that has
 
04:56:53.310 --> 04:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
no impact on driver's licenses and so
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no telling what that
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
will do like there's nothing to compare
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
it to I mean I don't I don't know what
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
tanif will do so I guess that's my
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
question is if we if we Forge ahead and
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
do this on our own what's tanif going to
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
do to our funding and I don't know who
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
answers that question representative
 
04:57:16.990 --> 04:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
Greg Am I Wrong yes so all 50 states
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
have something with this and what what
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
they talked about in here with this is
 
04:57:23.708 --> 04:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
if we decide that we're going to say
 
04:57:25.070 --> 04:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
okay we're not going to do this the
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
drive driver's license there's a certain
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
federal um government thing that they
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
require us to do we will not be in line
 
04:57:33.390 --> 04:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
with that anymore this this is this
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
could be a big problem all all 50 states
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
do some driver's license so this is
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
04:57:43.868 --> 04:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
problem um each state is required to
 
04:57:47.350 --> 04:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
have procedures so there's so it says
 
04:57:48.990 --> 04:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
right here Department of Health and
 
04:57:50.830 --> 04:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services states that there may be
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
significant fiscal impact to the state
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
since as a condition of receiving
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
Federal um is it 4D funds each state is
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
required to have procedures regarding
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
the withholding suspension or
 
04:58:04.350 --> 04:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
restriction of the licenses of
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parents who owe past uh
 
04:58:07.600 --> 04:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parents who owe past uh
due

04:58:09.030 --> 04:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
due
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
support what I'm seeing is I flip
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
through the report is every state seems
 
04:58:16.750 --> 04:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
to have a stated
 
04:58:21.150 --> 04:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
reinstatement policy and it is your
 
04:58:24.310 --> 04:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
statement that uh we don't in this bill
 
04:58:27.868 --> 04:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
correct yes I'm saying that we would be
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
completely out of line with all 50 in
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
the Federal government's requirement if
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
we no longer did this with driver's
 
04:58:39.230 --> 04:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
licenses and a reinstatement policy in
 
04:58:43.390 --> 04:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
the law covers that concern because
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
there's a way to State it to go about
 
04:58:47.868 --> 04:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
and get it back we currently have a
 
04:58:49.708 --> 04:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
reinstatement policy for getting their
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses they're able to get
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
their driver's licenses back they
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
actually we have a a warning period they
 
04:58:57.070 --> 04:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
have 20 days to file something saying
 
04:59:00.030 --> 04:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
that they're going to do whatever or pay
 
04:59:01.830 --> 04:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
a couple dollars we were told over and
 
04:59:04.270 --> 04:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
over that it's not instant thing they
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
have time and they're warned and they
 
04:59:09.270 --> 04:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
have the ability to contact and say
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this it's for habitual
 
04:59:15.788 --> 04:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
um uh abusers of the system that
 
04:59:18.190 --> 04:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
continue to not pay I mean once again
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the best in interest of
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
the child in being able to get to get
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
funds and this is like a last this is
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
really one of the last resort things
 
04:59:28.910 --> 04:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
it's not like they're like okay you know
 
04:59:30.270 --> 04:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're late one time we're going
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
to take your license away this is for
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
people that they've been unable and they
 
04:59:35.548 --> 04:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
they did say that they've successfully
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
gotten people to pay you know at least
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
start paying and then they're able to
 
04:59:41.948 --> 04:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
have their licenses but it's very rare
 
04:59:44.430 --> 04:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
that they actually do this my bigger
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
concern is you know the money from the
 
04:59:47.948 --> 04:59:47.958 align:start position:0%
federal government and us being out of
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
line with that I do not see that point I
 
04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to learn it but I'm looking
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
through this print out of every state
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
and every state has the delinquency
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
Threshold at this point for this many
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
days we're coming for you and then
 
05:00:08.830 --> 05:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
everything has a reinstatement policy on
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
how you get it back right so what do we
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
not have so Mr chairman yes this bill
 
05:00:18.430 --> 05:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
would take away the first half of it
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
which is we would we would no longer
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
take away licenses because that's what
 
05:00:24.910 --> 05:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
the bill prohibits us from doing the
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill says you are prohibited from wait
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
read it taking away so we would no
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
longer have a reinstatement process
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
because the you can't take it away and
 
05:00:38.190 --> 05:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
by getting rid of the taking it away and
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
the reinstatement process based on the
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note which I have now refreshed
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
my recollection that would put us out of
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with the state plan
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
requirements as outlined in title 4D of
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Act and if we are
 
05:00:54.030 --> 05:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with title 4D of the
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
Social Security Act the last page of our
 
05:00:59.310 --> 05:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
paper here says that the total loss of
 
05:01:00.750 --> 05:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
operational funding for New Hampshire's
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
child support funding could be 16.9
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
million in federal fund 1.2 million in
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
federal child support performance funds
 
05:01:11.590 --> 05:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
and 1.9 in the federal T of block ground
 
05:01:14.910 --> 05:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
funding so I was I guess I was hoping to
 
05:01:17.948 --> 05:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
see in order to pass it an amendment
 
05:01:20.070 --> 05:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
that would say you know that would
 
05:01:22.030 --> 05:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
change how we revoke it but if we
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
entirely remove the requirement to
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
revoke a license and have a way to get
 
05:01:29.310 --> 05:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
it back then that is going to cost our
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
state it looks like
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
179 $20
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
million and that to me I just
 
05:01:41.510 --> 05:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
can't I can't do
 
05:01:45.868 --> 05:01:45.878 align:start position:0%
it on page two of the uh the memorandum
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we've been looking at here with all
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
the states it actually has the federal
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
law here the states authorizing
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
suspension of licenses so it's actually
 
05:01:55.830 --> 05:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
on second page the federal law okay is
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah so while I I I might
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
personally have feelings about it I
 
05:02:08.350 --> 05:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
think I don't feel so strongly that I'm
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
willing to risk $20 million
 
05:02:14.548 --> 05:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
05:02:19.310 --> 05:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman and and
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
um what I have a hard time with is is
 
05:02:24.270 --> 05:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
those that are currently without a
 
05:02:26.590 --> 05:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
license because of child support they'll
 
05:02:28.830 --> 05:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
be getting their license back whether
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
they've been paying up their reage or
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
not this bill allows them to get their
 
05:02:34.520 --> 05:02:36.548 align:start position:0%
not this bill allows them to get their
license

05:02:36.548 --> 05:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:02:41.190 --> 05:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:43.750 --> 05:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
mine anyone
 
05:02:43.760 --> 05:02:46.030 align:start position:0%
mine anyone
else

05:02:46.030 --> 05:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
the representative bford well I'm
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
curious as to how much I had asked this
 
05:02:54.750 --> 05:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
question at the last at the hearing and
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh s uh attorney Susan person gave us
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of an indicator and I've
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
always wondered what would it cost us to
 
05:03:01.920 --> 05:03:03.350 align:start position:0%
always wondered what would it cost us to
actually

05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
um do something about it and she's
 
05:03:07.030 --> 05:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
actually the one that brought up the uh
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
the softer approach on the driver's
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
license I think i' like more information
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
on it um I know when we did the mandated
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh wage
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
assignment um they came up from Boston
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
actually and told us you do this and
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's 20 million $21 million so not
 
05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
giving us any more money than we did 20
 
05:03:32.190 --> 05:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
20 years ago but um sometimes there way
 
05:03:33.390 --> 05:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
around things
 
05:03:34.948 --> 05:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
so but anyway I wonder if we can get a
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
little information from the child
 
05:03:44.110 --> 05:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
here she was sitting there so
 
05:03:50.670 --> 05:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
patiently and was doing research while
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
she was well unfortunately I'm not sure
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
I have any more information at least on
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
that area um in that we would definitely
 
05:04:03.548 --> 05:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
need to speak to
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
DMV and find out how they deal because
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a joint thing of we tell
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
them and then they do that so I don't
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
know if that's a thing that that they do
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
we'd have to come up with a new system
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to to do that but that is
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
something a restricted license is one of
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
the things that is allowed under the
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh under title title
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
4D procedures under which the state has
 
05:04:34.110 --> 05:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
and uses in appropriate cases authority
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
to withhold suspend or to restrict the
 
05:04:37.868 --> 05:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
use of driver's
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
licenses we we we're looking if I may
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the cost to the state I mean we know
 
05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
the full cost could be as much
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
as $20 million but it uh sometimes they
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
just take a portion of something you
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
know anything about that that I don't
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
that I don't um we haven't had that
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
goodness we haven't had to deal with
 
05:05:03.390 --> 05:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
that recently um the
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
only minor fact that I know is uh at one
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
point several years ago
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
Idaho U wasn't going to pass the new um
 
05:05:17.628 --> 05:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
UA statute and the FED came down on them
 
05:05:19.830 --> 05:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
hard and quickly was what I was
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
surprised at so but I have no idea okay
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I have in my notes 42 USB 666
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
a16 yes sir and the note is we have to
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
suspend various licenses including
 
05:05:35.600 --> 05:05:36.750 align:start position:0%
suspend various licenses including
driver's

05:05:36.750 --> 05:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
licenses is that a correct citation I
 
05:05:42.430 --> 05:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
made yes sir and do you have it in front
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
of you I do of course you do would you
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
read it
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
please all right starting at the top in
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
order to satisfy section 6
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
542a of this title each state must have
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
in effect laws requiring the use of the
 
05:05:59.230 --> 05:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
following procedures consistent with the
 
05:06:00.830 --> 05:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
section and with regulations of the
 
05:06:03.150 --> 05:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
secretary to increase the effectiveness
 
05:06:04.548 --> 05:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
of the program which the state
 
05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
administers under this part and then
 
05:06:09.430 --> 05:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
part 16 says authority to withhold or
 
05:06:12.270 --> 05:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
suspend license we so it requires
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
procedures under which the state has and
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
uses authority to withhold suspend or to
 
05:06:19.590 --> 05:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
restrict the use of driver's licenses
 
05:06:22.030 --> 05:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
professional and occupational licenses
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
recreational and supporting licenses of
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
IND individuals owing overdue support or
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
failing after receiving appropriate
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
notice to supply comply with subpoenas
 
05:06:33.070 --> 05:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
or warrant
 
05:06:35.310 --> 05:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
related to paternity or child support
 
05:06:37.310 --> 05:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
proceedings so
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
there uncle's watching as well as far as
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
I know only once in my 23 years have we
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
actually attempted
 
05:06:47.430 --> 05:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
to take the license of somebody who
 
05:06:50.110 --> 05:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
refused to show up for paternity testing
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
and your testimony has been usually the
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
threat is enough to scare them can be
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
can be I mean it's the first it's the
 
05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
first time you you can sort of get them
 
05:07:01.708 --> 05:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
to talk to you if they're if they're not
 
05:07:03.470 --> 05:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
paying attention to all of the
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
send well what do you think
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
folks withdraw the motion you can
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion if you
 
05:07:16.750 --> 05:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
wish withdraw the motion in the second
 
05:07:19.990 --> 05:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's fine I takes courage to do that
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
after you've made a motion when new
 
05:07:25.708 --> 05:07:25.718 align:start position:0%
information is forthcoming so thank you
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
very much for that now would somebody
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:33.510 --> 05:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
motion uh I'll make that oh go ahead you
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
can do it I'm I oh I guess I'll write
 
05:07:40.590 --> 05:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
the report then all right one verse
 
05:07:44.070 --> 05:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
Kumbaya okay the chair recognizes
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%

okay there we have it 13 to Z 13 to Zer
 
05:08:54.788 --> 05:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
the motion itl passes representative
 
05:08:56.990 --> 05:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
Raymond could you come up with a
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
committee report for me please yes thank
 
05:09:03.270 --> 05:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
you I'll take that as yes thank you
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.070 --> 05:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
1425 um it said f n but it failed so
 
05:09:22.430 --> 05:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
let's any any difficulty with consent if
 
05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
we may do
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
it fine if we don't we can't then it
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
goes away but we at least put our ore in
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
the water any objection to consent
 
05:09:31.600 --> 05:09:33.230 align:start position:0%
the water any objection to consent
pending

05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
pending
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.400 --> 05:09:43.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:09:43.390 --> 05:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
Wonder oh we can fill something in a
 
05:09:48.270 --> 05:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
half an hour would you like me to
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
proceed with your
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
last all right uh
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
1564 please and I think everybody's
 
05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
figured out it is uh very similar to the
 
05:10:04.548 --> 05:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
1595 so 1595 from representative
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
Bickford is the prime and
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
1564 with representative katab as the
 
05:10:22.830 --> 05:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
prime and uh what we can do is open the
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
exec session on one of them and uh
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
somebody make a motion accordingly and
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
then I can put that into recess open the
 
05:10:34.470 --> 05:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
the second one and that what that will
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
give us is a chance to do things in
 
05:10:40.270 --> 05:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
parallel discuss the relative motions of
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
both we may decide to kill both pass
 
05:10:47.070 --> 05:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
both or do one in one so um
 
05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford would you like
 
05:10:52.110 --> 05:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
to make a motion on
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
1595 uh make a motion ought to pass
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:06.948 align:start position:0%
 
on

05:11:06.948 --> 05:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:10.350 --> 05:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
we're doing actually both in a row just
 
05:11:15.030 --> 05:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
hang in there um motion is auto pass by
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
bigford um and now we're going to put
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
that into recess and uh 16
 
05:11:23.600 --> 05:11:25.110 align:start position:0%
that into recess and uh 16
1564

05:11:25.110 --> 05:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
1564
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
representative kabs um representative
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:39.510 --> 05:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
on4 so now we have two bills in play
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
because they cover the same things
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford would you speak
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
please okay that's thank you 15 16 1564
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative long and
 
05:12:07.948 --> 05:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
second if there's no second to dies you
 
05:12:13.548 --> 05:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it but you
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
may what on
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
64 uh on 1595 I'm looking for a second
 
05:12:23.628 --> 05:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
that is your bill oh no one wants to
 
05:12:23.638 --> 05:12:26.390 align:start position:0%
that is your bill oh no one wants to
second

05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:29.070 --> 05:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
that all right representative Panic
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
seconds it wow and now now we may
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
discuss both bills because they're
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
plowing much the same territory but
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's some different numbers involved
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
and you and I have gotten emails from
 
05:12:47.110 --> 05:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
National groups on both sides of this
 
05:12:49.390 --> 05:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative bigford make your case
 
05:12:53.030 --> 05:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
please well this bill has been asked for
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
for more than 20 years from the
 
05:12:59.070 --> 05:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
Department of well from the reviews that
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Child Support Services
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
has been doing over the years they do
 
05:13:05.470 --> 05:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
these every four years I will I will
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
read a short paragraph from the uh 157
 
05:13:10.350 --> 05:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations is Adopt a time sharing
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment the high guidelines deviation
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
rate and the recommendations from survey
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
respondents speak to the overwhelming
 
05:13:24.030 --> 05:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
need for New Hampshire to adopt a
 
05:13:26.190 --> 05:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
statutory formula New Hampshire is
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
currently one of the nine states that
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
does not provide a formula in their
 
05:13:31.280 --> 05:13:32.350 align:start position:0%
does not provide a formula in their
guidelines

05:13:32.350 --> 05:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
many of these states are also in the
 
05:13:36.910 --> 05:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
process of adopting or considering
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
adopting a time sharing formula when
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
adopting a time sharing adjustment the
 
05:13:45.510 --> 05:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines deviation criteria should
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
also be
 
05:13:46.680 --> 05:13:48.590 align:start position:0%
also be
revamped

05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
revamped
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh many of the deviation criteria relate
 
05:13:54.990 --> 05:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
to time sharing so this report like all
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
the others as I pointed out
 
05:14:00.830 --> 05:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
$116,000 and this is a state report it's
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
not a by
 
05:14:06.350 --> 05:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
some organization or anything it's it's
 
05:14:09.070 --> 05:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
done for the state and and is contracted
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
every four years and so uh the state the
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
the child support
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
um time sharing is what you have before
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
you is a parenting time
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
adjustment and
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh it will U satisfy all those demands
 
05:14:30.680 --> 05:14:33.270 align:start position:0%
uh it will U satisfy all those demands
um

05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:36.270 --> 05:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
what else I can say um I do have a pro
 
05:14:39.868 --> 05:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
and con if if you want or you yeah you
 
05:14:48.310 --> 05:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
ahead um first the major recommendation
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
of the quadrennial review which is this
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
was to implement a formulaic parenting
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
time adjustment 1564 proposes a
 
05:15:02.590 --> 05:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
presumptive zero order in the very
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
narrow circumstance when both incomes
 
05:15:06.868 --> 05:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
and parenting time are equal or
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
approximately equal if and only if both
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
parties first agree to evenly split
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
add-on costs in contrast
 
05:15:19.510 --> 05:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
1595 provides a broad formulaic
 
05:15:22.750 --> 05:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment for any mix of incomes
 
05:15:25.708 --> 05:15:25.718 align:start position:0%
parenting times and add-on costs using a
 
05:15:28.390 --> 05:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
parenting time formula adopted by many
 
05:15:30.030 --> 05:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
of the other states and supported by
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
judges attorneys and parents in the
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
survey conducted as part of the qural
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
review the need for a broad rather than
 
05:15:43.350 --> 05:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
a narrow formula is reflected by data
 
05:15:45.868 --> 05:15:45.878 align:start position:0%
that shows parenting time situations are
 
05:15:49.150 --> 05:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
approximately evenly split between lower
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
and higher parenting time situations
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
additionally HB 1564 proposes a complex
 
05:15:59.310 --> 05:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
deviation mechanism for the majority of
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
situations occurring outside the zero
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
order which would increase rather than
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
decrease the already high deviation rate
 
05:16:08.040 --> 05:16:09.990 align:start position:0%
decrease the already high deviation rate
of

05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
48% in New Hampshire um in contrast to
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
Broad formulaic approach of 1595 May
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
decrease the deviation rate by as much
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
as 1 half Based on data in the report so
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to achieve
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
second 1564 proposes to increase
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
self-support Reserve EX uh 130% of
 
05:16:35.590 --> 05:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
federal poverty line in line with the
 
05:16:38.830 --> 05:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the quadral review
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
1595 was unable to include the
 
05:16:44.270 --> 05:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation due to legislative
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
drafting rules uh but would welcome this
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
amendment however 1595 does stand alone
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
without that you know both bills can be
 
05:16:56.548 --> 05:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
passed and we'll get both things
 
05:17:00.510 --> 05:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
achieved uh third 1595 incorporates the
 
05:17:02.990 --> 05:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
quadrennial Reg
 
05:17:05.310 --> 05:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation to shift child care
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
expenses and medical costs from income
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
deductions to add-on cost to be
 
05:17:12.430 --> 05:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with the income shares
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
methodology adopted by New Hampshire
 
05:17:19.270 --> 05:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
hb564 has not included the
 
05:17:21.190 --> 05:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh so we've got that
 
05:17:24.750 --> 05:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
added in here too 1595 amends the
 
05:17:27.150 --> 05:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
ability to pay calculation to include
 
05:17:30.430 --> 05:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
direct child costs by the obligor in
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
order to prevent the the obligor being
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
inadvertently forced below poverty level
 
05:17:37.470 --> 05:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with the federal
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
2016 fifth in order to support proper
 
05:17:50.830 --> 05:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
calculation of proposed changes HB
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
1595 corrects the pration of child costs
 
05:17:57.868 --> 05:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
Beyond base child cost to also include
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
add-on costs to allow a fully functional
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
income shares
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
methodology as originally envisioned the
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
correction was identified in the 2004
 
05:18:13.390 --> 05:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
310 uh commission report and affirmed in
 
05:18:16.510 --> 05:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
2019 by the Supreme Court Anderson so
 
05:18:18.548 --> 05:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
we're we're taking care the Anderson
 
05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that says the
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to fix this
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
formula um and that what it does to
 
05:18:28.350 --> 05:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
ensure the that both the custodial and
 
05:18:30.390 --> 05:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
non-custodial parents share and the
 
05:18:32.670 --> 05:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
support responsib ability for their
 
05:18:35.708 --> 05:18:35.718 align:start position:0%
children according to the relative uh
 
05:18:38.430 --> 05:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of each parent income in
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
contrast 64 1564 leaves the current
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
pration mechanism
 
05:18:47.868 --> 05:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
unchanged in summary HP 1595 provides a
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive solution for the same
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
cost while decreasing rather than
 
05:18:53.520 --> 05:18:55.788 align:start position:0%
cost while decreasing rather than
increasing

05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
deviations which is the direction we
 
05:18:58.708 --> 05:18:58.718 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
go um in child support guidelines
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
additionally it also resolves a known
 
05:19:07.270 --> 05:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
longstanding flaw in New Hampshire
 
05:19:09.628 --> 05:19:09.638 align:start position:0%
income shares model which should further
 
05:19:11.670 --> 05:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
decrease deviations by promoting
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
Equitable calculations in short while HB
 
05:19:18.990 --> 05:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
1564 has Merit 1595 provid substantially
 
05:19:21.150 --> 05:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
better bang for the buck in other words
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
you get a very comprehensive bill here
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
to do a lot for the same cost as
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:32.670 align:start position:0%
 
Finance

05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
05:19:34.750 --> 05:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions for
 
05:19:38.910 --> 05:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
bill I seeing nonone representative
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
katab on
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:53.948 --> 05:19:53.958 align:start position:0%
1564 thank you so this bill seeks to
 
05:19:55.590 --> 05:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
well let me take a step back so in the
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
in the special uh Family Court committee
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
we heard much testimony on the need
 
05:20:05.350 --> 05:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
to untie the judge's hands so to speak
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
because right now deviations aren't
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
allowed in the cases of shared parenting
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
time and so when particularly when the
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
kids are
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
5050 parenting time with either parent
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
and one parent uh we had a mom come in
 
05:20:20.110 --> 05:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
that basically said that she was paying
 
05:20:22.110 --> 05:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
so much to the other parent that you
 
05:20:23.390 --> 05:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
know he was getting to take the kids on
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
vacation and out to dinner and she could
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
barely afford to pay her bills let alone
 
05:20:29.190 --> 05:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
take the kids on vacation or out to
 
05:20:31.628 --> 05:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
dinner um and so with that in mind I
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
think it's it's important that we kind
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
of untie the hands but that we do keep
 
05:20:36.750 --> 05:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the children in
 
05:20:39.548 --> 05:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
mind and so these are rebuttable
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
presumptions uh rep ball and I had had
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
worked together on the summer with with
 
05:20:45.510 --> 05:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
getting together with some of the
 
05:20:47.190 --> 05:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we've seen that over the
 
05:20:50.270 --> 05:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
past decade with this much needed change
 
05:20:53.310 --> 05:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
you know um thing after thing has been
 
05:20:55.310 --> 05:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
ited so we did get together with several
 
05:20:58.548 --> 05:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
family law attorneys from um nhj we got
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
together with nhla we got together with
 
05:21:03.150 --> 05:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
some mediators and we tried to
 
05:21:05.548 --> 05:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
see what would work that also wouldn't
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
ruin things for the families that are
 
05:21:08.548 --> 05:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
agreeing because we've got 80% of
 
05:21:09.868 --> 05:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
families that are agreeing and then the
 
05:21:11.310 --> 05:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
20% who aren't so we want to make sure
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
that whatever we do is is going to work
 
05:21:16.510 --> 05:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's we were able to come
 
05:21:19.670 --> 05:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
together and and reach an agreement on
 
05:21:21.910 --> 05:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it does many great
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
things it further it increases the
 
05:21:27.548 --> 05:21:27.558 align:start position:0%
self-support reserve up from 115 to 130
 
05:21:29.470 --> 05:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
which has long been recommended to do in
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
the quadrennial report so
 
05:21:34.270 --> 05:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill addresses many of
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
the issues that we heard about in the
 
05:21:37.868 --> 05:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
the special Family Court committee and I
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
do think that it will help many families
 
05:21:43.708 --> 05:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire without lowering the
 
05:21:46.310 --> 05:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
child support so much that we have
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that we don't
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
want to have so thank you any questions
 
05:21:54.628 --> 05:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:57.150 --> 05:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
katab we have two different bills before
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
us looking at the same
 
05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
thing we can vote itl on both of them we
 
05:22:07.868 --> 05:22:07.878 align:start position:0%
can vote one up the other down or we can
 
05:22:09.470 --> 05:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
send them both to the Senate and let
 
05:22:11.948 --> 05:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
proceed you mostly so I I'm just
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
confused because we have two bills out I
 
05:22:28.270 --> 05:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
mean personally I would like to see
 
05:22:31.868 --> 05:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
representative kab's pass and not uh
 
05:22:35.470 --> 05:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative bigford so I don't know
 
05:22:36.788 --> 05:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
how we go about
 
05:22:39.310 --> 05:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
that well we have motions on both of the
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
bills so why don't we take one uh the
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
first one was 1564 there was a motion by
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative Deon of ought to pass
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
we'll take a mo we'll take a vote on
 
05:22:52.910 --> 05:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
that and then we'll take a vote on 1595
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
which representative Bickford did you
 
05:22:58.390 --> 05:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
make the motion to pass uh he did I
 
05:23:00.990 --> 05:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
thought okay so I was just going to say
 
05:23:04.230 --> 05:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
bought an amendment for that
 
05:23:07.270 --> 05:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
1595 which was a uh domestic violence
 
05:23:10.110 --> 05:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
thing that represent cab has her a bill

representative Deb
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
Hobson's uh Little Bill it is a
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
um kind of a housekeeping item what it
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
does is ensures that New Hampshire
 
05:27:58.270 --> 05:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
supports the best interest in
 
05:28:00.030 --> 05:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
educational rights of the students and
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
so on by making sure that the Department
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services Bureau for
 
05:28:08.110 --> 05:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health notifies
 
05:28:10.510 --> 05:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education on the Daye
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
a Cod order res signed I mean it's that
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
sexy right it's just that things uh we
 
05:28:18.830 --> 05:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
the desire of the sponsor the desire of
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
others and the desire of you may
 
05:28:25.390 --> 05:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
remember Isidor Rodriguez LeAndre from
 
05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Council on
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities was that uh
 
05:28:33.750 --> 05:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
reporting wasn't always done and this
 
05:28:35.910 --> 05:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
will ensure it so therefore the chair
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
calls upon himself for a motion that
 
05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
he's already spoken to and moves 1511
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:47.200 --> 05:28:51.150 align:start position:0%
 
pass

05:28:51.150 --> 05:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:55.708 --> 05:28:55.718 align:start position:0%
me and I need a second who's who is i r
 
05:28:58.510 --> 05:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I know that
 
05:29:01.590 --> 05:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
oh okay so that's the reason I mean it
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
is like the ultimate of housekeeping it
 
05:29:05.788 --> 05:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
just makes sure there's an agency
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically tasked with
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
communication and you will see that in
 
05:29:15.270 --> 05:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
the boldface lines 10 and 11 in the bill
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's all it does we had one written

you please speak to the amendment to
your

05:32:07.708 --> 05:32:07.718 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
bell yes if everyone recalls this is the
 
05:32:13.948 --> 05:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
same bill that went we unanimously um
 
05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
approved last year we did make um a
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
minor change it came back to us because
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
we I mistakenly use the term benefits
 
05:32:22.470 --> 05:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
instead of child support but in
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
testimony it was brought to our
 
05:32:26.670 --> 05:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
attention that we should clarify the um
 
05:32:28.830 --> 05:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
charter schools and home education
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
programs um
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
so we did include that in here to make
 
05:32:36.110 --> 05:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
sure that where there's nothing um left
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
loopholes if you recall um chairman this
 
05:32:48.590 --> 05:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
was closing the loophole of when a child
 
05:32:50.910 --> 05:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh turns 18 while they're still in
 
05:32:52.510 --> 05:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
school but then they choose to drop out
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
of school and the original Bill said it
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
was whichever was later so they could
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
still be getting child support past the
 
05:33:02.948 --> 05:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
of 18 and in the amendment this is
 
05:33:04.628 --> 05:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
something that I deal with in my work
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
with the developmentally delayed and
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
other groups line 16 in your Amendment
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh it it no longer just says until the
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
child reaches 21 it adds or no longer
 
05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
qualifies as a child with a disability
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
which stretches it a bit which it should
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes that was at a recommendation in the
 
05:33:27.628 --> 05:33:27.638 align:start position:0%
um special committee on child care where
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get away from um putting
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
age 21 now so that we could link it to
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
another bill in case that um age should
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:42.990 --> 05:33:43.000 align:start position:0%

05:39:10.468 --> 05:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the quadrennial uh
 
05:39:12.750 --> 05:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
review and I'll read that to you it's
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
very rather short says either repeal the
 
05:39:18.310 --> 05:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
law providing for grandparent liability
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
to support the children of their unwed
 
05:39:24.270 --> 05:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
minor children or add more specification
 
05:39:26.628 --> 05:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
to it there are numerous justifications
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
to eliminate it it is not a a common
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
issue child support from the parent if
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
able should be prioritized and
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
establishing policies for consistent
 
05:39:40.910 --> 05:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
treatment would require a lot of time
 
05:39:43.708 --> 05:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
and resources for few cases more
 
05:39:46.110 --> 05:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
specification would entail whether to
 
05:39:48.030 --> 05:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
limit liability only to public
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
assistance cases
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
applications uh to both the
 
05:39:56.430 --> 05:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
maternal and parental uh
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
paternal paternal and paternal
 
05:40:02.468 --> 05:40:02.478 align:start position:0%
grandparents identification of income to
 
05:40:06.468 --> 05:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
be used and several other specifications
 
05:40:08.030 --> 05:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
which I believe is what I reported to
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:10.718 --> 05:40:13.468 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

05:40:13.468 --> 05:40:13.478 align:start position:0%

05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
so anyway I'm trying to clean up these
 
05:40:21.868 --> 05:40:21.878 align:start position:0%

learn you know next to the last sentence
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise it just sort of gets to a
 
05:43:10.320 --> 05:43:15.110 align:start position:0%
otherwise it just sort of gets to a
conclusion

05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
