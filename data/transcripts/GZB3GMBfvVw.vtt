face next slide slide
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
four uh on on the left you see a a
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
visual representation of the structure
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch we have two trial
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
courts the circuit court and the
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
Superior Court we have one appell Court
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
which is the Supreme Court and all three
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
courts are supported by the administrat
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
of Office of the courts and I'm going to
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
take a minute to go through each one of
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
those elements starting with the circuit
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
court on the next Slide the Circuit
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
Court was created by this legislature in
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
2011 it combined The District Court the
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
probate court and the Family Division uh
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
into one
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
unit on the next slide you will see that
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
the circuit court is broken into 10
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
circuits one for each County and we have
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
34 individual locations around the
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
state on the next slide you will see
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
that right now our head count is 49
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges that is our
 
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.829 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges that is our
authorized

00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
um uh number at this point we are fully
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
um staffed with judges those judges
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
those full-time judges their work is
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
supplemented by one part-time
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
judge uh two perdum judges and some
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
judge judicial referees and Senior
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
active judges who are able to discharge
 
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
judicial functions subject to the
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
ultimate approval of a sitting Circuit
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
Judge so that's how the workflow gets
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
handled by Jud judicial officers in the
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
circuit court next next slide perhaps
 
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
the most um one of the more important
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
ones is the amount of number of cases
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
flowing through our Circuit Court these
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
are 2023 calendary year numbers uh
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
102,000 cases and you'll see at the very
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
top of that Circle of interest to this
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
committee 45,000 criminal cases this is
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
before the felonies first re unwind so
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers that 45,000 are the the
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors that the circuit court has
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over Superior Court has
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over felonies Circuit Court
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors so this number is going to
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
be revised uh as uh to reflect felonies
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
first I just don't have those numbers
 
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.509 align:start position:0%
first I just don't have those numbers
right

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
now next slide uh Superior Court
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
Superior Court is our court of General
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in New
 
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh of relevance to this
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
committee it is the court where jury
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
trials take place and is the court where
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
all felonies are prosecuted it also has
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh civil jurisdiction for uh cases over
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
$255,000 on the next slide you will see
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of our case load by case
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
type and again on the left in the yellow
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
about 8,700 criminal cases flow through
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
spe court and again these are 2023
 
00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
numbers uh both courts both circuit and
 
00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
Superior Court handle felony um handle
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
search warrant and arrest warrant
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
requests from law enforcement agencies
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
around the state so that's part of the
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of both of our trial
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
courts next slide uh we have 11 Superior
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%

moment we're authorized at 22 two
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
justice next slide of particular
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
interest to this committee given its
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
work on House Bill
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
318 uh earlier this or uh in December we
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh took on three new
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
magistrates and on January 1st they
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
began their work and uh their
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as um directed by
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
administrative order the Supreme Court
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
is listed here uh they have been uh
 
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
fully trained by uh judges from both
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
courts and their weekend Duty which was
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
the principal a principal motivating
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
reason for creating magistrates not the
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
only one um began on the first weekend
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
in January so the our three magistrates
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
are switching off weekend by weekend
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
they serve 9 to one on each of the
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
weekend days and then on the weekday
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
they are integrating into our uh trial
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
courts to assist uh with matters that
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're authorized to handle in our
 
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.269 align:start position:0%
they're authorized to handle in our
trial

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
trial
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
courts next Slide the Supreme Court as I
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
said one appell Court in New Hampshire
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
that's the Supreme Court uh we have one
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
chief justice for associate justices in
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
addition to hearing appeals we have

General super superintending authority
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
over the legal profession in New
 
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and therefore we handle
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
matters such as attorney discipline um a
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
bar admission
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
uh and we um we interface regularly with
 
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519 align:start position:0%
the bar association we are unified bar
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which means every every
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
lawyer in New Hampshire is required to
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
be a member of The Bar Next slide you
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
will see our
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
um case load these numbers on your slide
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
are for 2023 and I do want to um give
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
you some numbers from 2024 the year that
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
obviously just finished uh so um
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see in 2023 we issued 61 opinions
 
00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
that number for 2024 is
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
71 the bottom number is the key
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
indicator of our
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
productivity and um in
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
2023 it was 728 dispositions in 2024 was
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
752 and that's the highest number in our
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
court since 2015 so our productivity is
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
is at a high level over the last 10
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
years for for last
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
year could you just real quick um tell
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
the members what a final disposition
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
means those so every case that comes
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
into our system uh will be handled
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
either through a full-blown
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
argument or through case uh through
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
orders issued by the four the five
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
justices coming together and in some
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
instances we will decline jurisdiction
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
where jurisdiction is not mandatory so
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
the dispositions is is how many of the
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
cases that came into our system are
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually resolved one way or another by
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
Court uh very quickly we are all on the
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
next slide supported by the
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts and
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
then uh uh slide 18 you can see the
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
various important functions performed by
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
the AOC including our legal and
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
legislative representation uh I should
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
have mentioned of Harris is here as our
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
director of communications uh and
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
various other functions that help uh
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
assist the court staff and judges around
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
the state are handled by the AOC very
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
quickly I'd like to share with the
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee some of our both challenges
 
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.789 align:start position:0%
committee some of our both challenges
and

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities um next slide is
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
20 um and I want to go through each one
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
of these very very briefly but you can
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
see our challenges and opportunities
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
listed there 21 challenge number one and
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
um it is the is is that I am most
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
concerned with it's the issue that keeps
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
me up at night more than any other which
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
is the Safety and Security of everyone
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
who passes through our
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
doors and um we have made important
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
strides over the last several years in
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
terms of enhancing that Safety and
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
Security um we have benefited from uh
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
arpa dollars the that the governor
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
sonunu uh his office helped uh make
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
available to the judicial branch and and
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
one of one of the projects we are
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
undertaking is a sight by sight physical
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
assessment of security threats and
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
security uh enhancement opportunities
 
00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
for each one of our locations I will say
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh um we our security is sort of
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
bifurcated in circuit courts uh it's
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
handled by uh court security officers
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
who are employees of the judicial branch
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
work in the AOC and we are greatly
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
benefited in in Superior Court with a
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
tremendous partnership from the
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
sheriff's County Sheriffs who are in
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
charge of security in our Superior Court
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
and I want to acknowledge and thank that
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
partnership it's absolutely essential in
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
keeping our everyone who passes through
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
our doors uh
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
safe uh next challenge not really uh of
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
concern to this committee's jurisdiction
 
00:18:55.149 --> 00:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
but I do want to note it in in Superior
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
Court uh the influx of cases arising
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
from the YDC matter has been
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
significant and uh 1 1300 filings in
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
Superior Court against as you saw a case
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
load of 24,000 it's material and it's
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
material also because these cases are
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
quite complex they generate a lot of
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
motions they consume a lot of court time
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
and a lot of Staff time indeed if chief
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
justice Howard we're here he will tell
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
you he's got an employee in the
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
electronic filing Center in Manchester
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
who comes in at 4 uh 5:00 in the morning
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
to process all the all the Motions
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
involved in the YDC
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
cases um the next challenge is access to
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
Justice and this is sort of a perennial
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
challenge uh facing our judicial system
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
not sort of it is and uh in any given
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
day walking into our Circuit Court up to
 
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
90% of litigants on either side of the
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
case are self-represented
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh one issue that I do want to call to
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
the attention of this committee that is
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
quite serious is is what I think is
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
fairly described as a crisis in our
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
indigen defense system uh indigen
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
defense is principally handled in our
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
state by the New Hampshire Public
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
Defenders Office uh that is a publicly
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
funded organization since 2010 it has
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
had a 262 per increase in its retention
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh dropping in retention uh and that's
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
augmented by uh increased case load and
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
case loads that are more sophisticated
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
and they're more sophisticated because a
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
reason is because the proliferation of
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
electronic evidence particularly video
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
evidence um Mo many of our law
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers are now having body
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
cams and obviously uh video cameras are
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
are much more of a reality of law
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement so this is contributing to
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
the case load um contributing to the
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
workload in our public defender
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
office this affects the entire Criminal
 
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
office this affects the entire Criminal
Justice

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
System criminal defendants are entitled
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
to representation under both the state
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and uh you will see that
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
the LBA issued a report on the judicial
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
Council last October and found that in
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
March of 2024 between 20 and 40
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
incarcerated defendants had no attorney
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
in between 120 100 and 125
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
non-incarcerated so these are
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that are in play
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
and when when uh the accused don't have
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys it affects us in the court
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
system for obvious reasons we can't
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
proceed with the case and um there it it
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
affects the entire
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
system um that said we're also making
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
progress thanks in part to the
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives on um on the
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
Civil side the legislature approved
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
approved a bill to permit par
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
professionals to represent clients in
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
designated case types in our Circuit
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
Court every Circuit Court in the state
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
we're implementing that program and
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're pleased by the results so far
 
00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
another opportunity is our treatment
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
courts uh we the adult drug court has
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
been uh in place legislatively sponsored
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
for more than 10 years um we have mental
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
health courts in both Superior and
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
circuit courts uh the legislature
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
approved last year in new veterans court
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
and uh we're working on a homeless Court
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
initiative with the mayor Manchester to
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
try uh to assist in in resolving those
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
problems broadly speaking treatment
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
courts are an
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity um to identify those in our
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
system who would
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
benefit from treatment in a clinically
 
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate setting so that they don't
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
come back into our system that's broadly
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
speaking our objective
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh the commissioner Corrections is here
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
she's been a tremendous assistance in uh
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
both our treatment court and mental
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
health court initiatives but also the
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
next opportunity I want to talk about
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
which is a broad judicial branch
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
initiative to look at how we can better
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
serve those in our community suffering
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
from mental
 
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.029 align:start position:0%
from mental
illness

00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
illness
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh the slide 26 begins just couple
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
slides on innovation we we are we try to
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
use the resources we have as efficiently
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
as possible um one great example is
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant um there are more than
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
7,000 cases in circuit court on landlord
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
tenant and thanks to some federal
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
dollars where we've been able to
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
establish a diversion program with a
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
great success rate so it it gets
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
resolution to both the landlords and the
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
tenants and it reduces the case load in
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
in our system uh next slide 27 in our
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Court we are moving to a
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
platform where all evidence is
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
electronically presented and their their
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
efficiencies to the court and to the
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys involved on both sides and
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
then finally um we're using technology
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
particularly tax uh to on both civil and
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
criminal side in both of our courts uh
 
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.549 align:start position:0%
criminal side in both of our courts uh
for

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
reminders understanding that that's how
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
many of the people we serve receive
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
information it's very very successful in
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
reducing failure to appear
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
rates so with that that's a very broad
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
overview happy to answer any questions
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
you will have my contact information and
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
that of Aaron on the last page and uh we
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
look forward to engaging with the
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee over the next year and thank
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman for the
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you for coming Mr
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
chief justice do any of the members have
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
questions um I I have one myself have
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
has the bar looked at um
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
possibly as a condition of membership
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
mandating so many pro or hours to indent
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
defendants per
 
00:25:10.039 --> 00:25:12.110 align:start position:0%
defendants per
year

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and I don't mean to put you on the
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
spot um I think mandate is is with
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
respect to pro bono hours or or
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
delivering there there is an
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
encouragement to to to engage in prooo
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
activity but a mandate is it's not
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
required right okay um but I will say Mr
 
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.590 align:start position:0%
required right okay um but I will say Mr
chairman

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
um uh at least since I've been there uh
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
2021 this crisis has been percolating
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh one of the things that the
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court did was
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
convene uh the large firms in our state
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
to say we've got we've got a real
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
problem in our engine defense system we
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
need attorneys to step up
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
and help and I will say the response was
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary okay and we were able on a
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
volunteer basis to get attorneys from
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
many many of our uh firms around the
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
state to come into the system and assist
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
with this issue and are they still doing
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
that yes oh that's good to hear I'm glad
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
I'd rather not talk about me and they
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
just doing it um one other question I
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
had has the court explored any kind of a
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
partnership with UNH law whereby someone
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
could get some some um tuition waved if
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
they dedicate so many
 
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.590 align:start position:0%
they dedicate so many
hours

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
um to to my knowledge no um but and I
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
know the chair is very interested in
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
this and you communicated to to uh
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
General Council krian about this it's
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of great interest to me
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
nationally yeah there are some really
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
interesting initiatives around the
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
country about granting tuition
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
conditioned upon serving the you know
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
delivering pro bono hours in
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
particularly addressing a problem that
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
is uh existing in virtually every state
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
which are called rural legal deserts
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah where there are just vast swas of
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
geography with less than one attorney
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
for 1,000 residents wow and and for
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
instance in South Dakota there there's a
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
really interesting pilot Pro uh program
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're piloting which does exactly as
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting so there there is
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's lots of interest and energy
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
around the country about this and and I
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a conversation worth
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
worth following and having good that's
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
great to hear I think um we should take
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
advantage of the fact that we own a law
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
school I think so I think that's a um
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
something I'd like to pursue that's
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
great thank you but I will say that the
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
loss we we do benefit from it I know in
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
my opinion uh really forward thinking
 
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
law school which is heavily engaged in
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
our community and for instance the
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster scholar honors program uh
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
true Jewel of our estate um does with
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
those attorneys young attorneys they
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
undergo the first year of curriculum of
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
any law student and then spend the
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
second two years doing what's basically
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
an experiential learning program under
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
specialized uh curriculum developed in
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
partnership with the Supreme Court part
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
of that experience is delivering pro
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
bono hours oh that's good including to
 
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence and the and
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
the bar association stealth program
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's excellent I'm glad you
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
shared that with US Representative s you
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
question no well I'm sorry she used to
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
sit there it's okay it's a it's a good
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
person to be confused with um I was just
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
curious I I had uh met with folks from
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
603 legal aid um and also um New
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal aid uh two two SE
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
programs but they kind of work together
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
and and serve different um um you know
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
demographics of folks um and so I was
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
just wondering when people do pro bono
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
is that the main um institution that
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
they do it through or organization that
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
they would do pro bono hours with uh pro
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
bono opportunities there there there're

about your bureaus just for the purposes
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
of this committee so criminal is broken
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%

00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
just within the criminal justice Bureau
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
um and um some of the different
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
operations that are contained in that
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.669 align:start position:0%
operations that are contained in that
which

00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
um from time to time I will come and
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
talk to you about there might be
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
topics and in terms of my um the areas
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
where uh our my division might overlap
 
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
with your committee work would be really
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
we provide general counsel to State
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
Police the department of safety so
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's issues that come up with the
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle code um issues that come
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
up with um you know immunities that
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
State uh uh um uh agencies and uh
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
employees um have during the course of
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
civil litigation those are types of
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
issues that um our litigation unit our
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and infrastructure Bureau
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
would be interested in looking at um in
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
terms of legislative issues when we do
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
review legislation we obviously get
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal note requests for anything that
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
might impact the agency operations so we
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
pride we try to provide an honest and
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
Frank assessment of what we think the
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
impact would be to the to the Department
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
um outside of that um we generally
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
because we're obligated as the
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to uh defend and
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
enforce any law that the legislature
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
passes that's signed by the governor we
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
tend not to weigh in too much on
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
substantive policy um because we don't
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
want our words to be used against us in
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of lawsuit um later on so um
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
we but we we take our job seriously
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're um we maintain the independence we
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
we it doesn't matter we're party blind
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of once legislation is passed
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
and becomes enacted into the law it's
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
our job to enforce
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
it would you be a good resource for
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
members to contact if they had a
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
question about legislation that they
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
were thinking about bringing before it
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
actually becomes
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
law uh absolutely Tom and I um we would
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
be the ones that would kind of Marshal
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
any sort of leg legislative response um
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
or response to the legislature um
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
anything touching the criminal code Tom
 
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680 align:start position:0%

statement as a department uh we revised
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
these some years ago uh to make sure
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
that our staff were involved in
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
articulating what we do every day um and
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out one of them uh
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
it takes one team in our department to
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
be successful we have a large law
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%

so forth on the following uh page you'll
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
see our large uh departmental
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
organizational structure um including
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
our housing units in an overview of
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
those um not pointed out here but should
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
be pointed out here is we have 11
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
district offices across the state of New
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where our probation approval
 
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.520 align:start position:0%

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.550 align:start position:0%
officers do their fine work in our New
Hampshire

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
communities um now it gets into the next
 
00:38:59.309 --> 00:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
page my favorite cuz I love data uh that
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
is something you'll learn about me this
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
is our current uh data of who is
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in the state of New
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in our facilities um out of
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
our facilities means they are out of
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
state in another facility being
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
supervised um just so you understand
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
what that means I always like to provide
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals by minimum uh
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
sentence structure in the State uh we'll
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
tell you uh by way of information I've
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
been with the Department um on my 22nd
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
year there has been a shift in
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
sentencing that's not a judgment
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
statement that's just a reality the
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
average sentence structure was 3 and 1
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
half to 7 now it's pushing closer to
 
00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:38.839 align:start position:0%
five or more years um the reason for
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is we have a large population of
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
individuals who have uh violated
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
criminal code around sexual assault and
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
so those sentences are longer for uh
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
correct reasons and then the next uh
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
data set is around people's maximum
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
sentence structures one thing we can
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
never control for in reporting data to
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
all of you is whether somebody has a
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
consecutive sentence we can't predict
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
their moving movement into that
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
consecutive sentence so this is a
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
snapshot based on what people are
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
serving at the time of the data
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
set uh the
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
following page uh shows you the trending
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
of uh bookings into our facilities uh we
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
break it out uh by month uh we look at
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh men and women we do monitor um
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates it does matter we do
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
look for overcrowding and need to pay
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
attention to the number of beds we're
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
utilizing in comparison to the staff we
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
have to make sure we provide the
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate supervision that's the data
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
set on that page the following page
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
breaks out the the demographics of those
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in the state of New
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in very broad groups on
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the page breaks out their
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
um very detailed crime into higher
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
categories of crime so you'll see the
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
largest percent in New Hampshire are
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
crimes against persons I've already
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
articulated that and then other assaults
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
have you ever looked at how we stack up
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
against the other states with these
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
crimes against persons um that's a
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful question uh chairman and the
 
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
answer to that is uh yes um uh we have a
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
higher rate of individuals incarcerated
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault in the state of New
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um about one-third of our
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
men's population are in for either
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonia sexual assault or fonia
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault um in comparison to other
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
states what I have found nationally is
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
they generally plea their cases is down
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
so those that are incarcerated for
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
similar offenses in other states end up
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
under I would call it our parallel
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
category of second degree assault so
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
their sexual assault rates look lower
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
whereas our uh prosecutors prosecute to
 
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.670 align:start position:0%
whereas our uh prosecutors prosecute to
the

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
fullest thank you um it also provides me
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to let you know that we
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
are ranked number one uh in the country
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
for Corrections and crime and what that
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
means is we have a very low national uh
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
crime rate in comparison to other states
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
and we actually are one of the only
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
states that have a reduced incarceration
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
rate and so from my vantage point
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
leading the organization through the
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic when States chose um to let
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
people out before their minimum sentence
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
structure we did not um the work we've
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
done in our state uh with the Chief
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
Justice uh on the Judiciary side with
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
specialty courts have positively
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
impacted appropriate diversion from
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
incarceration um and we've really been
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
Nimble before the pandemic to effectuate
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the use of incarceration
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh welcome commissioner nice to see you
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
sir um I'm I'm looking at the
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
demographic page and the the 60 the uh
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
population by age and the 60 and over
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
category which
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
is larger than I thought it would be but
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't matter um how many
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
you're safe representative you're
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
okay um how many uh of those 60 and over
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
are serving life without parole
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
sentences uh represent share I can't
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
give you that number on age what I can
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
tell you is we have approximately 100
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who will never leave our
 
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
custody because their sent in structure
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
I just don't have it broken out by age
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
break and a follow-up question U
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
at would it be fair to say that the
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
medical costs uh for the over 60
 
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.910 align:start position:0%
medical costs uh for the over 60
population

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
are more significant than the younger
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
population as we're talking about about
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
age I want to be careful because in
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
incarceration um the costs around
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
healthc care actually start to increase
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are 51 and over so
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
to the point uh of your question yes
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
healthc care costs increase based on age
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
but it starts at the at the lower uh one
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
step down demographic range um and I can
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
give you some followup of the average
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
healthc care cost by age range and last
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
question um roughly uh what does it cost
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh per person to incarcerate someone for
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
a year approximately $452 a day was our
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
last statistic thanks thank you you're
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair nice to see
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
you again commissioner as well um in the
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
past couple years you know i' obviously
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research in you know your
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
work um and I believe some statistics I
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
saw over the past couple years um
 
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
Illustrated us having a really high rate
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
of um violations and people being in
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
prison because of parle violations I was
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that's true if you
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
could speak to that at all certainly I
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
can speak to that now or I could speak
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
to it when I get to those slides happy
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
to do when you get to it yeah and if
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
anyone has what was your question go
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
ahead I just have a question about the
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
importance of the sentence of a year or
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
a year in a day and how you have 46
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
people that are there and how some
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
people go to jails and some people go to
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
prison uh thank you for that question
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh individuals that that you'll see
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
on this uh the previous page on sentence
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
structure when it's one year or less
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
they go to our County jails if an
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
individual in our County Jail system has
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
multiple consecutive misdemeanor charges
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
of the statute as it currently States at
 
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
of the statute as it currently States at
the

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
366th day they would come to the
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and we work
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
with our County Superintendent on those
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
decisions uh when those decisions happen
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
if we work together and say they're
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
better served staying in the county jail
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 345 days they have to serve
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Corrections pays
 
00:45:36.549 --> 00:45:36.559 align:start position:0%
back to the county jail U the average
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
daily cost of that person's
 
00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:40.559 align:start position:0%
incarceration so I think that's your
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
welcome all right average cost by
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
Healthcare by age following page I want
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
to thank the legislature for your
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
support uh several years ago um through
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
the budgeting process and the reality a
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
of our law enforcement ranks in the
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections this slide uh
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
shows you the where we were and in the
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
bottom uh right hand corner shows you
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
where we uh rank as far as
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
competitiveness across law enforcement
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
in the state um and uh it's made great
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
strides I'll send some follow-up data uh
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
at our worst point we had over a 50%
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in our correction officer
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
rank and file we've done a tremendous
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
job over the last year in reducing that
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
to 42%
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
um these are Nimble numbers so one or
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
two losses shift them but what that
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
means is at the highest point we had
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
approximately 189 vacancies out of 589
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities and now we're down closer
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
to 162 or less um those uh are net gains
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the organization and in 2022 we had a
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
high rate of retirement from our system
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
welld deserved post the pandemic and the
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
stress in a correctional environment and
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's also normalized itself where we
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
had historically seen a anywhere between
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
15 and a high of 20 people retiring we
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
back to that normative uh departure rate
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
at retirement and the same separation
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
rate when it people self- select uh to
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
leave our employment that number is
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
normalized and I'll send some update
 
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
numbers with that regard what that means
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
is that being said you guys aren't
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're not fully staffed you're still a
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
mess right with the staff thank you sir
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
I was about to say with that being said
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh we are we are still um working very
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
hard against the same tide that our
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
other law enforce Partners experience in
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and I'm I'm
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
proud of our state the expectation to
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
join the ranks of law enforcement are
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
the same across all lines of those
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities whether you're a community
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
police officer a State Trooper so on and
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
so so forth and a corrections officer
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
and we hold that standard and we hold
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
that standard on purpose um because
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of authority and integrity
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
and so while we're all competing against
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
all of those same entry level people
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
trying to attract people to come into
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections and I think we're doing a
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
much better job to explain why that
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
mission is so important but um I have to
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
tell you if I was a young person and I
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
was going into law enforcement I'd pick
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
a cruiser in my freedom in the community
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
um because I wouldn't have known all
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
that I know now um but uh we actually
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
today started the day with approximately
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
25 of our staff who have stepped up and
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh said they want to voluntarily be part
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
of our Recruitment and Retention efforts
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
as ambassadors of Correction so we need
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
your help uh any opportunity to include
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
us in any uh legislation on recruitment
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement we want to be part of
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
that legislatively um and we want to sh
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
the ship because we also know
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we cost the state of New
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of money to fulfill our
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
mission when we're looking at $27
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
million in overtime that is the burden
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
that our Corrections Officers are facing
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
every day and we've done a lot of
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
creative things within the scope of our
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
operations to give them a chance to go
 
00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
home and use other relief resources but
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of um our staff is
 
00:48:57.870 --> 00:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
maybe I should just stop there I don't
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
know sorry sir moving on I wanted to
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
move into the other side the
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation and treatment side of the
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
organization and so on this next slide
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh give you a tenor of the work that our
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
mental health clinicians are doing by
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
area total number of appointments uh
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
total number of clients served in those
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
appointments and cross different lines
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
of uh mental health contact but our
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
mental health team is really uh working
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
very hard to treat the diagnosed
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
illnesses of individuals incarcerated in
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to meet the
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
Constitutional requirements that we are
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
required to do but also to find Wellness
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
in individuals and to reduce and we'll
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
get to it representative Murray that
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
reincarceration rate due to uh parole
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
violations and um that's an important
 
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
part of our conversation with you today
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
the following slide just lists a very
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
high overview um of the uh outpatient we
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
call them outpatient no they're not
 
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:51.799 align:start position:0%
leaving the institution but they're not
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
in a um call a psychiatric bed in the
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit they're moving
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
from their housing unit to the mental
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
health floor within the corrections unit
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
and these are the services in a high
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
level that we offer within the
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
department included in those Services is
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
um we've gotten creative in how we use
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
our housing units and created modified
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic communities within our
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and what
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
that's done is uh allowed individuals
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
who acknowledge their mental illness who
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
want to come together and become U more
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
compliant with their treatment um
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
increase their skill sets and coping
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
skills around that and that's made a
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
marked difference in those housing units
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
when you literally come together with a
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
common purpose uh I don't think we'd be
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
surprised you get better um and so the
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
following sheet are infographics that
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put together to both
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
educate um anybody who we can have
 
00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
listen to us about the work we do and
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
one of those units is the focus unit we
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
have a high prevalence rate of
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
individuals with substance use disorder
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in the New Hampshire
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections um and we need
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
to tackle those challenges with the
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
relapse and the impact act on
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
individuals um in the justice system
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
this program was implemented many some
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
some years ago and is showing a marked
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
stride in reducing returns to
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
incarceration and um I'll leave it to
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
you I know you'll read it and if you
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
want followup uh we'll engage in that
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
followup the other units we talk about
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
are called Wellness units and we have an
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
intensive sexual offender treatment
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
service you're going to see a slide that
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
this um this slide is u a result of
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
working with the council state
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
governments and trying to understand
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
specifically the rate of opioid use
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
disorder that we're treating in the
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections so on any
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
given day in our department we have
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
approximately 45% of people incarcerated
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
who have an opioid use disorder that's
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
around 800 people of those 800
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
individuals uh 32 excuse me of those 800
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
individuals 80% of them have elected to
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
be on some form of treatment a
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment and we
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
have a robust program in which we engage
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
in that constitutional treatment
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
intervention as well this slide was also
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
very informative because it taught us
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
the work we were doing as a department
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
connecting people to Medicaid so thank
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
you for um authorizing Medicaid
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
expansion uh it has positively impacted
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
individuals incarcerated in their exit
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
and we're really connecting them to that
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
service and it's making a difference and
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're using those Services upon
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
release within 7 Days Of release in the
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
community and connecting for their
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment their pharmace
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
pH ceuticals and other treatment
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
interventions and so that my the segue
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
leads me to another
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
infographic we the state uh remitted
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
what's called an 1115a re-entry waiver
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the Center for Medicaid Medicare
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
Services we were approved for that
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
waiver and we started on January 1st
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
2025 with the authorization 45 days
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
prior to someone's release when they're
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eligible we can have two
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
provider contacts and two peer-to-peer
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
contacts and Medicaid will cover 30 days
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
of discharge medications and I believe
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
very firmly that this initiative will
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
decrease people's returns to
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration and so I I leave you with
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
a what I call is a highlevel infographic
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we can get down into uh lots of
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
detail at your uh personal
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
discretion critical to the success of
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
that program um and even the work that
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
we do as our case management services so
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
I've given you a highle slide of our
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
case managers what they do the areas
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
that they support individuals
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be critical as they
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
are now in helping people apply for
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid have those uh appointments
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled and have those contacts prior
 
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
scheduled and have those contacts prior
to

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
release the following page gets into the
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
detail of the risk assessment tool this
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
is a risk of residivis assessment tool
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
this is not a risk of violence or those
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
clinical risk assessments people talk
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
about this is literally specific to
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
criminogenic factors and your risk of
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
return to incarceration so I outline
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
that in a high level W for you on the
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
next slide our case management team does
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
what we call internal referrals to other
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
areas of the department as well as
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
external referrals to Partners in the
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
community I give you a little high level
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
overview of those interactions they're
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
really the the navigator for a person
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerated when somebody is booked
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
into our system a case manager starts on
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
the moment they meet with them and says
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
what do you need to do to find your path
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
to parole to find your path out of this
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
institution and even for the 180 people
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
who won't leave our Institution what are
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
you going to do for your own betterment
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
while you're here um and they do that
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
annually and update those plans at any
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
rate and pace of the information changes
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
within our electronic
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
system the following page represents
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
also psychotherapeutic programs uh
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me they're not therapeutic they
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
are um delivered by non-clinicians that
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
we offer within our department to
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
improve people's social emotional
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
learning and other coping skills and
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
factors that result resulted in their
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
incarceration so I'll leave that to you
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
we have a robust Educational Service
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
this is the statute that created the
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
correction Special School District we're
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
the only Corrections Department with a
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
certified high school and we should be
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
proud of that other Corrections
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
departments um when they have a
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections teacher it is a Corrections
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%

our Department of Education are
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
qualified to teach in our normal High
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
School uh systems um we deliver programs
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
so that people can attain their High
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
School uh diploma and we will invite you
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
to those graduations they are Prof found
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a tough lady even I've teared up
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
there um and they are impactful um and
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
we like to really celebrate those
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
moments whether somebody is 65 getting
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
that high school diploma or 25 in
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
addition we um support people to get
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
their high school equivalency in New
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is called the highet and
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
then we have a robust Career Technical
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
education program that helps individuals
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
and I've already moved two slides ahead
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
um probably four slides ahead so there's
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
more detail the Career and Technical
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
education Center really is the next step
 
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
after your Base education which is to
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
help build those employment and
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
Vocational opportunities uh again we
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
opened a licensed cosmetology program
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we continue to open
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
it and now we've Advanced it and we're
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
opening a barbering program that just
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
started at our Men's prison and
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
conquered um we look for all types of
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity and continue to look for
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities to connect people to
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
employment and really uh wonderful
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
occupational release uh because we know
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
that reduces uh reincarceration ation
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
and improves people period um we have
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
been working with White Mountains
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
Community College and I can't say any
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
more positive things about White
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
Mountains Community College to provide
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
under the second chance pel Grant
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity people with access to
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
college level degrees uh we started at
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
our Northern New Hampshire correctional
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
facility and are working with them even
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
in our Southern tiered facilities as
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
well as partners at nhti and the
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire University and so
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
we really uh thank the legislature for
 
00:56:59.029 --> 00:56:59.039 align:start position:0%
passing the commission that looks at
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
education in Corrections and that's
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
really moved forward and we look forward
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
the first report was published so that
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
is available as
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
well incarceration infects families so
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
I've also included an infographic on our
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
family connection center so you can see
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
the number of individuals we're
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
supporting both in uh partnership with
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
the DCF and reconnecting parents through
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
their programs uh to be effective
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
parents for their children when they've
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
lost that right in custody uh as well as
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh General opportunities for individuals
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
to improve their parenting skills their
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
visitation and uh communication skills
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
through uh video contacts that are
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
supervised and other creative outlets
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
and structured curriculum um that
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
program also demonstrates its
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in reducing
 
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.430 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in reducing
reincarceration

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
reincarceration
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
what would be Corrections if we didn't
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about religious
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
services and the religious land use uh
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated persons act uh we I wanted
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
to highlight the number of spiritual
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
Services we support it is Tiny writing
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
so I'll get it to you in digital format
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
so you can zoom in um but we've uh my
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
spiritual leaders across the
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
organization do do a robust job and I
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
can't say enough about the volunteers
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
that come into our institutions and help
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
support Pathways to uh spiritual health
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an important overlay
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
for people if it's something they want
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
then we want to make sure it's available
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
to them because we do find it really
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
helps people again stop returning to
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration I hope you heard my theme
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
about stopping returning to
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
incarceration uh because we're going to
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
head to probation and
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
parole the next slide is an infographic
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
that gives you um the average case loads
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
for 2023 and 2024 by district office
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
I've spent most of my tenure trying to
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh sh the sh the ship in this area uh we
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
as I indicated we want to partner
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
effectively with our Judiciary and those
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
specialty courts but the department uh
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
didn't get any additional probation and
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
parol off offers so I balanced using the
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
state's reallocation process to create
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
more probation and Par officers to
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
equalize their case loads when I took
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
over bless you their case loads were one
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
to 100 or more in some cases it was one
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
probation appr officer to 125 supervises
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
the national um the national statistics
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
to meet is 1 to 55 uh and that also
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
depends on the risk of the case load of
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
the persons they're supervising so I
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
hope I said that right um so we give you
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
what our levels of supervision are and
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
um we have reduced those case loads
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
closer to the national average there are
 
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
a couple other district offices that
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
exist today where some of those uh
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
ratios are 1 to 80 and we're still
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
working to to correct that process uh
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
through our own means uh but with the
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
passage of veterans court uh we don't
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
have additional staff and we're trying
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to uh navigate support
 
00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.230 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to uh navigate support
that

00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
process uh the next slide does get a
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
little bit more detailed so you can read
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
it better the types of supervision
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
across the state and then detailed
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
description of case load by type of
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
supervision by location across the state
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
are the next following slides so to the
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
point of the
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
question the research done by the
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
Council of state governments um and its
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation we don't have a high
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
parole violation rate uh so when you
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
look at the number of individuals on
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
parole supervision there's approximately
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh just over
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
2,000 it's not a high number of those on
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
supervision that are coming back but it
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
is somewhere around the 1% of those
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
people that come back annually affecting
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
the beds that we use in the prison
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
system so I just want to be clear
 
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
there's not a high parole violation rate
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
but the number that comes back takes up
 
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
about 40% of those beds so um I just
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
don't want everyone to think that our
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
pration parole officers are just
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
violating parole all the time so with
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
that stated you're going to see a graph
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
that looks like this and what that is is
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
a summary of The Adult Parole board's uh
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
revocation reasons about revocation of
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
parole and those things are around
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
returning to criminal Behavior
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
engagement in substance use um usually
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's uh multiple relapses lack of
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
compliance with their substance use
 
01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
treatment plan and then uh commonly
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
found in possession with the intent to
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
distribute illegal drugs Pro probation
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
appr officers are making the right
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
decisions at the right time to bring
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
people back to incarceration but what it
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
tells me is when someone returns I need
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I have the substance use
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
treatment and those Pathways to
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
re-engage that process one of the
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
struggles as articulated both by my
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
probation parole team and the Adult
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
Parole Board is granting somebody the
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
privilege of the parole to go to a
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
treatment service and they never show up
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
and they abscond and then they become a
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
fugitive that doesn't serve any of us
 
01:01:59.309 --> 01:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
well and we have approximately 300
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
people right now in a fugitive status on
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
our case load so I give this information
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
to you because the work we're doing on
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
the 1115a waiver is fundamentally simple
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
if we can get people connected and have
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
that therapeutic relationship with their
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
provider before their leave they're very
 
01:02:17.549 --> 01:02:17.559 align:start position:0%
much more likely to go to the third
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
appointment and the fourth appointment
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
and stay compliant with treatment and we
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
really think that will make a marked
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
difference in continuing to reduce our
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate so I see some hands up
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh very briefly on on on that graphic uh
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
one of the uh uh uh components is uh
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
revoked for Community failure what's
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
Community failure that's a great
 
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
question uh The Adult Parole Board
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
basically says all of the assets we
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
tried to engage with you it didn't
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
matter what they were it failed you
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm wondering about what
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who actually apply
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
for parole and receive a par parole
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
hearing actually wind up getting paroled
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
and is there a lot of variation
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of crime
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative Muse I would definitely
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
defer uh that question to The Adult
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
Parole Board who's an independent uh
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
body um and I will talk with chairman
 
01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
Rogers Roger Phillips to make sure we
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
get that information to you thank you
 
01:03:25.799 --> 01:03:27.150 align:start position:0%
get that information to you thank you
you're

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
welcome the uh in anecdotal sense most
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
individuals are granted the privilege of
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
parole at their first
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
hearing represent
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um I was
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
curious you know you mentioned that
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
sexual assault is you know a significant
 
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
portion of why people end up in um
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
incarcerated but then the number of
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
people um sorry I'm going back to the
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
page the number of people basically
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the uh Services the
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
behavioral health sex offender treatment
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
is like a lot lower than I would expect
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious like what is the
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
what is the reasoning behind that people
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
just not taking advantage of it that's a
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
great question so the timing of access
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
to that is around their sentence
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
structure so those 155 people are in a
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
Therapeutic Community having uh regular
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
contacts and we provide people access to
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
that program based on their earliest
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to release factoring if the
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
sentencing document says they can get
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
time off if they complete so if you will
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an analytical art of moving
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
them in um that what that line does not
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
account for is they may show up in those
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
other lines of service getting other
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
counseling outside of that specific um
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
treatment need so they could be seeing
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry they could also be going to
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
other mental health groups at the same
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
time you're
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
welcome right representative
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair um I just wanted
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
to Echo something that you said um I
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
went to the graduation last year at the
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
women's facility and it was absolutely
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
amazing I was in tears I was the only
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
person who wasn't you know staff member
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
or family um but it really made a huge
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
difference to me so I would just suggest
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
to everyone else that if you when you
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
get that invitation it's something that
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend taking advantage of
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that being said if
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
you've completed your presentation I
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um know if we would be
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
welcome to set up another tour for the
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
new members to come by the facilities
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
100% but I would not be done if I didn't
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
tell you the best
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
news so the last page of your
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
presentation shows the road map uh to
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
reducing our recidivism and uh leave it
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
with you to show you initiated programs
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
by year and the changes and shifts in
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
people's return to incarceration these
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
are when people are released in 2018 we
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
track them uh for 3 years post their
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
releas release and to see if they return
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the initiatives that we've
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
started really targeted that first year
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
prior to release to reduce people's
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
reincarceration rate uh and we've we've
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
done an excellent job taking it from 48%
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
when I started down to the average of
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
40% um and we continue to analyze why
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
people come back but we also continue to
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
analyze why people are successful and so
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll continue to pass that
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
information onto this body as you think
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
about the work that we do in New
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we're making marked
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
strides we're doing excellent job but
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
attorney's offices within each
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
County in addition there as you heard
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
from Chief Justice McDonald there's
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
circuit courts where misdemeanors
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
violations are
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuted a lot of the county
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
attorney's offices also appear in
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court um to prosecute those
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and violation level offenses
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
on behalf of certain towns so for
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
example in maramont County the towns of
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
I know like chiester canbury hopkington
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
um Bradford Newberry New London contract
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
with the county attorney's office and we
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
do their misdemeanor prosecution um
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
other towns for example conquer has its
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
own Municipal prosecutor's office that
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
prosecutes misdemeanors in Circuit Court
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition to Prosecuting criminal
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
cases felonies and misdemeanors we also
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
handle everything within those cases for
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
example if competency is raised that
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
something our office would
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
handle uh we would follow up if a person
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
was found for example not competent to
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
stand trial but was dangerous because of
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
a mental illness we would follow up and
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
do the uh non-emergency involuntary
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
admission at probate court for those
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
people as well so I'm I'm happy to
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I'm a a frequent
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
person here in front of the committee
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
which I think is a result of geography
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the sense that all the County
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys talk but since we're in
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
conquered it's easier for us to come
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
over and talk um I personally have
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
prosecuted in both circuit court and
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
Superior court for a number of years so
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to give you some insight
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
sort of the view from the ground of that
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
um and we do all I should point out that
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys we do talk to each
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
other we talk to the Circuit Court
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and get input on uh a lot of
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%

01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%

attorney's offices are funded on a
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
county level not at the state level
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%

Sheriff of bellnap County I'm also the
 
01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
elected president of the New Hampshire
 
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Association which is made up
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
of all 10 of us sheriffs across the
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
state a few things about the sheriff's
 
01:11:38.189 --> 01:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
Association is we meet monthly um all
 
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
the sheriffs that are available we meet
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
down at the police academy on the third
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Thursday at 10:00 a.m. uh we always
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
invite uh you folks and anybody else who
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
wants to attend and interact with the
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff's offices uh to to be part of
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
that uh we talk about legislation
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
upcoming legislation legislation that
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
we'd like to uh have drafted and brought
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
forward we talk about uh the different
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
things that are happening across our
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
communities and things that happen
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
because each community of course is
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
different uh but we all have a lot of
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
commonality so we try to share resources
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
and keep a line of communication open uh
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
it is our office is a uh political
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
office so uh we come with different
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
views not all of us have the same views
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
and it helps us work through some of the
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh intricate problems of our communities
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
basically that's that's uh that's what
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
we do uh we are you know the oldest
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
former law enforcement here in the state
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
so we take great pride in that and our
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
Duties are found our duties and
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are found in RSA 104
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and then we we do uh work with
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
other rsas as well uh as we're uh added
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
to that we'd like to have conversations
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
about the different legislation that's
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
being drafted or thought about uh before
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
it becomes uh you know a full-blown uh
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
Bill and then we come in and then we we
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
look at it a little bit uh deeper uh
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
because we look at how it's going to
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
affect so you may put something in there
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
about a police officer or uh um
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
conservation officer or something like
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
that uh but there might be implications
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the Sheriff's offices as well uh so
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
we we do a deep dive into that have
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
discussions and and uh we most certainly
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to come before this committee
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh with cards uh against uh some of the
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
legislation but of course we we do at
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
times now I've testified uh before this
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past i' I'm in my third
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
term so I've been here a couple times uh
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
representing both myself uh as the
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff of BNP County and as um previous
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh Secretary of the uh Sheriff's
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
Association and uh and again
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
conversation is key and and uh we want
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
to work through this stuff so we invite
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
you to be part of that conversation uh
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
if you choose uh we want to be uh
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
Advocates to to the criminal justice
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
system and uh and talk about these
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
things bail reform I know is always uh
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
big um the different areas of you know I
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
listen to the the uh uh commissioner of
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections um you
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
know the things when people get released
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
on uh probational parole a lot of times
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
the the cases will end up back at the
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
super Court which will result in
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
warrants which then my office has to
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
deal with so um these are all things
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
that you know each part is connected so
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh we are officers of Superior Court uh
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we are constitutional officers uh
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
based on the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
so uh we take people's rights very
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
serious and and that's what you find
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
from our Sheriff's Office I can take
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
questions if you have
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
any um would you uhu appreciate it if
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
members had questions about laws that
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
may implicate the sheriffs if they
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
contacted you before they drafted
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and if so can you give uh
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
leave a contact information for people
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
yes we would definitely appreciate the
 
01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
conversation um again you you can draft
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
legislation as you choose um and we
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
would never stop that but uh being part
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
of the conversation at least we can give
 
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
you the Insight of where we we it on it
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
or or maybe a different Viewpoint that
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
you might not recognize as your as as
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
your intent um and again sometimes it's
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
just a few extra words in there that
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
really make the difference uh the
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
difference between us uh supporting that

01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%

conversation is key we'll we'll be more
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
than happy one thing about offices we
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
try to be as effective and as efficient
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
as we most certainly can and we we
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
answer to you folks uh as our as our
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
delegate members and uh and we are
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
accountable you know for every penny in
 
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
our budget and when we uh when we need
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
extra money we go before you to uh to
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
ask for that extra money and uh so again
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
conversation is key uh we want smaller
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
budgets as well as you do and we're
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers just like everyone else in
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
this room and uh but again Effectiveness
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
and uh and and that's what I ask of my
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
delegation members um before you start
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
cutting and and and all that uh ask
 
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
yourself am I efficient and am I
 
01:16:32.189 --> 01:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
effective and if the answer is yes then
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
let's talk about why I need the increase
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
you me see who we get
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
left um the Hampshire Public Defenders
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Suzanne kage I'm the
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
interim executive director of the New
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Defenders I took on
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
this role 7 days ago however I was a
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
public defender uh for 15 and a half
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
2021 to start my own practice I retired
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
in June from that practice and now I'm
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
here I also worked at the Attorney
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
General's office in the consumer
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
protection and an antitrust Division I
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
want to start I wish that Chief McDonald
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
was still here because I really would
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
like to have thanked him personally for
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
bringing to the commission the crisis
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
that we're having right now in the
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
public defender program in New Hampshire
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
for those of you that are new and aren't
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with how the criminal justice
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
system works in the state the sixth
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
amendment requires that if the state
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
charges you with a
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
crime and you could lose your Liberty
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
and go to jail as a result of being
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
convicted of that crime the state has to
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
give you an attorney to represent you if
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
you can't afford to have one
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
yourself that's where the public
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
defenders come in we are one of the few
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
states that the public defender program
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
is operated as an independent we're a
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Law Firm the only people we
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
represent the our only client is is the
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we get a contract
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
every two years from the state to
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
provide all the indent events across the
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
state so it's a big job we cover all the
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
counties as you've heard before there
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
are 11 Superior Courts 17 circuit courts
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
we have 28 circuit 28 specialty courts
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
we have 140 attorneys on a good day that
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
might change because we've lost three
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
already the case loads are crushing this
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
is a national issue and it's affecting
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's particularly
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
affecting our North Country so those of
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
you that represent Coos County or
 
01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
Grafton County we're in a crisis mode
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
right now trying to find public
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
defenders that will work in those areas
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
because they're rural um last year in
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
well in 2023 we don't have the numbers
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
for 2024 yet but in 2023 we handled
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
21322 cases Criminal
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
cases with 140
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers who are driving all over the
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
state to courts in all all of the
 
01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.510 align:start position:0%
state to courts in all all of the
different

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
locations what we we do not Advocate or
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
testify on behalf of laws we have a
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
board of directors that oversees us they
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
do any kind of advocating as far as
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
testifying goes to to this
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee and we also are under to the
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
um supervision our budget particularly
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
with the judicial Council I think we're
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
one of the few branches that have asked
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
for significant increase because of the
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
crisis that we're facing we cannot have
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
people sitting in jail without having
 
01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.950 align:start position:0%
people sitting in jail without having
legal

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
representation so we are taking we don't
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
like to just complain about issues we're
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
working on mitigation as well to get
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
more attorneys our pay scale for public
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
defenders is not where it needs to be
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
because the work is hard and grueling
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
and we're losing a lot of lawyers
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
particularly young ones and older ones
 
01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
because they're just burning out the
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
average case loads right now across the
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
state are running close to 100 and
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's just not ex it's not manageable
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
it's not something that can be
 
01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
maintained so some of the mitigation
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
effects that we're working on and we
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
welcome any suggestions from anybody
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
that could have particular suggestions
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at trying to hire lateral
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys across the state or outside of
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
the state to come to New Hampshire
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in the rural areas because
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
if we reach out to Colorado or we reach
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
out to Wyoming they may we may be able
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
to poach lateral attorneys that are
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
experienced and want to live in more
 
01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.830 align:start position:0%
experienced and want to live in more
rural

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
rural
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
communities we're looking at we do I
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
noticed earlier that I don't recall who
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
one of you asked the question regarding
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh do we work with UNH School of Law
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I've met with them
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
this week uh we do work with them they
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
have an excellent criminal clinic and
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
they take cases for us they're Limited
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
in the number of CA these are students
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
so they can't have heavy case lows but
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
we we are working closely with them as
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
well we are um considering asking the
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to change rule 36 and what
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
that is it's a rule that allows
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
people that are like third year law
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
students that aren't members of the bar
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
yet but they can practice in court under
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
the supervision of a bar attorney in the
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
state if we can get laterals coming from
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
other states and it takes a while I'm
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
not sure what the process is to wave in
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
or take the bar in New Hampshire but if
 
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
we could adjust it to perhaps
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
accommodate exper when I when I say
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
lateral attorneys I'm talking about
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
experienced attorneys the public
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
defenders are usually staffed by Young
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys coming out of law school that
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
want to do public service work but when
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
you have case loads this High you really
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
need to have enough experienced
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys to be able to mentor and train
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
the younger attorneys to be able to take
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
on more
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
cases so those are the mitigation issues
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're working on right now to try to
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
bring solutions to the table regarding
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
this issue um
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
as far as the consequences of the laws
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
that are passed by this commission our
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility in administration is to
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
keep all of our attorneys informed of
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
any laws that are passed criminal laws
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
any changes to the laws and what sort of
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
collateral effects those laws might have
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
because when you pass a law for instance
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
as an example armed career criminal
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
which was passed many decades
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
ago the collateral issues of that are
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's a mandatory sentence and when I say
 
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:31.719 align:start position:0%
mandatory it means that a judge has no
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
discretion in determining what the
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
sentence should be we don't have that
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
many mandatory sentence in mandatory
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
sentences in the state but that's one
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
that's a particular issue because it
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates any kind of discretion that a
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
judge can have and I can get into more
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
details if anybody has questions about
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
that or thefts for instance
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
when the law was passed that a third
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
theft we're talking shoplifting can be
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
charged as a
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
felony and a felony is anything that
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
results in prison time so a misdemeanor
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
is anything that can result up to 12
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
months in jail and a felony as was
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
stated earlier is anything that goes
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
over that 365 days and that would
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
require that they go to
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
prison so a law such as what we would
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
call a three strikes law law where two
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
shopliftings lead to misdemeanors but
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
you get a third shoplifting that can be
 
01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.669 align:start position:0%
you get a third shoplifting that can be
a

01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
felony which changes the workload of the
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
attorney and also affects court dockets
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
across the state that those are the
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
things that we are dealing with right
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
now um I don't have a packet to hand out
 
01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
now um I don't have a packet to hand out
yes

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
so um thank you I I I have to admit that
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
um uh much to uh the sh of of uh Miss K
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
she's a former student of mine
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
so she she carries that through her life
 
01:25:06.639 --> 01:25:08.669 align:start position:0%
so she she carries that through her life
unfortunately

01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
um what's the starting pay three
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions what's the starting pay for a
 
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.430 align:start position:0%
questions what's the starting pay for a
public

01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
defender I am reluctant to give any
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
specifics because this is my seventh day
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
on the job I believe it's in the
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
and and again this is with the caveat I
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
can provide all this information upon
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
request that's more definitive 67,000 I
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
believe thank you and it caps out uh
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
second question
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
um several years ago uh a combination of
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh legislation and Court rule uh the the
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
court was obligate the courts are
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
obligated to appoint councel before
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is arraigned my understanding
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
so that they have on a on a on a
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to which they're entitled to
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
Council of Class A misdemeanor and a
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
felony um it's my understanding that
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's just because of Staffing reasons
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's been a struggle uh for the public
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
defender program is is that getting any
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
better or is
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
that I want to say thank you for that
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
question I'm sure I'm not sure
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually arraignments are a big issue I
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
have spent two of the last three days
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
talking to several of the managing
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys throughout the state and the
 
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
arraignments are causing a major problem
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
um there are you can be arrested for a
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense and cash bail is is
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
requested or cash bail is put into
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
effect you have to have an attorney if
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
you especially at that point if you if
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to go to jail for a
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor a lot of the arraignments
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
are being done by video and you have to
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
have in the old days let's say you
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
didn't necessarily have an attorney
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
there at that point that's not the case
 
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
anymore so you're correct um but that is
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
a big issue that I've discovered in the
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
last seven days is the system for
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
arraignments for incarcerated
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor clients is severe and I
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what the solutions are or if
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's getting better for that matter and
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
and Fa one last thing and and just a
 
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:24.280 align:start position:0%
comment uh decades ago now when I was a
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
public defender uh I managed a couple
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
offices and we never had lawyers in our
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
offices with case loads of over 55 even
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
the more senior lawyers and that's a uh
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
just to give the members of the
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
committee a sense of how acute the
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
problem is right now it's acute
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and some states
 
01:27:46.510 --> 01:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
are going through uh litigation Maine in
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
particular they didn't have a public
 
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
defender program um Idaho other states
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going I I again I'm hesitant to
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
say with spec specificity but legal
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
actions are taking against certain
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
States because the public defender
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
programs are in such a crisis that you
 
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
have people sitting in jail for a long
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
period of time without a lawyer New
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
say I still believe is we're a small
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
state so I think we have a a way of
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
putting our arms around crisises that
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
bigger States can't do and I think we we
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
have a very good program we have we're
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
now we're known throughout the country
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
as a great place to get trained that's
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
still in effect that's still our
 
01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
reputation that we TR we do we do not
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
just hire an attorney and throw them
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
into a courtroom that doesn't do anyone
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
any any good we train them for six weeks
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
we give them mentors and then we send
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
them out there Co caused a big
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
disruption and a lot of that a lot of
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
the younger attorneys didn't get that
 
01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:54.639 align:start position:0%
Hands-On colle
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
one-on-one training that they would have
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
gotten during Co because everything went
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
remote so I'm trying to determine how
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
South thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:15.320 align:start position:0%
question uh might be a little bit unfair
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
because of uh you've been in the
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
position such a short time but there is
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
a pool of experience against attorneys
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
who might not have Roots anywhere in the
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
country I'm speaking in terms of
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
veterans who are uh getting out of uh
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
the military uh JAG officers who have
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
significant uh uh legal background who
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
might be looking to relocate to uh uh
 
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we have so much to
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
offer I'm just wondering if in the
 
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
public defender office are there any e
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
efforts to reach out and
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
recruit uh veterans that is a very good
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion and that is exactly the type
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
of thing that I'm looking for as the
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
Director um and I don't know the answer
 
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
to that but that's what I will be
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
finding out in the next two days and
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
determining if we're doing that um a lot
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
of a lot of the and there there's a
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
great pool of attorneys in the state
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
that are criminal defense attorneys but
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
to so we would get the first assign
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
councel goes to the public defenders if
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're Indigent and if we have a
 
01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
conflict then it goes to a different
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
group we have contract attorneys
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
contract attorneys take and there may be
 
01:30:39.719 --> 01:30:40.870 align:start position:0%
contract attorneys take and there may be
some

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
some veterans on in our amongst our
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
whole I know we have veterans that are
 
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
public defenders in the state I'll look
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
into that but just to
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
explain so we take the first case if if
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
we are not conflict we take all the
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
criminal cases for Indigent defendants
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
if there's a conflict we have a contract
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
attorney group they actually have a
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
contract with the state to take a
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
certain amount they don't have to take
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
the cases but they have a contract to
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
take cases if we give them the cases
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
then we have another group called
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
assigned councils assigned Council don't
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
have any um contracts but they take
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
cases at a higher rate than the contract
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
Council makes which doesn't make a lot
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
of sense when you think about it and
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
even those rates are
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
low top of my head I'm saying $125 an
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
hour $100 an
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
hour the cases that we are dealing with
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
in the state and that's been referenced
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
several times are very complicated we
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of sexual assault cases those
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
are extremely complicated cases to
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
manage um homicides have gone up those
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
are very difficult cases we work with
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney generals on that um we have
 
01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
a high degree of mental health issues
 
01:31:58.270 --> 01:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
among our clients clients have become
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
much more needier than in the last 10
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
years a lot of homeless population a lot
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
of mental health issues with those homes
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
f a lot of drug addiction that all
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
complicates the the cases and electronic
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
Discovery electronic Discovery is
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
just made and I would say across the
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
aisle the YDC case was referenced
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
earlier there are over a million pages
 
01:32:21.639 --> 01:32:22.629 align:start position:0%
earlier there are over a million pages
of

01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
Discovery and case and in my private
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
practice I actually had one of those
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
cases and I don't any longer because I I
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
left my practice so the comp the issues
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
among the workload and and I'm I'm sorry
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't answer your
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
question but I would like to find out
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
myself now that you've brought that up
 
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
how many veterans we do have that may be
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
in the public defenders and how we could
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to others that are looking to
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
expand their legal career or go into
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
this type of work
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
chairman uh one of the things that I'm
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
sure you struggle with is to have a
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
public defenders office that re uh
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
reflects the racial and ethnic uh uh uh
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
community that you
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
represent in New Hampshire I'm
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
recruiting minorities is very difficult
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
by expanding the pool of applicants to
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
include veterans you would significantly
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
help in that regard so thank you it's
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
not a question I'm just I I very much
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the insight and the input
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
though in that because we are struggling
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
with retaining and you want to a good
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
point of contact would be uh ad the
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
state agitant General's office they can
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
put you in touch with people in the
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense who would be able
 
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
to um maybe you could put some type of
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
an ad together for retiring dog
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
Jacks representative
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
Newman um do you expect that there would
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
be any impact from the new magistrate
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
law that's been passed for arraignments
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that do you have any
 
01:34:11.709 --> 01:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that I am not able to answer
 
01:34:13.229 --> 01:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
that question right now as I said
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
arraignments went up to the top of my
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
list within the last two days because of
 
01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:21.400 align:start position:0%

members uh we meet as a general body

every other month we meet as an
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
executive uh committee every uh on the
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
months that we don't meet with the full
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
membership our our purposes are
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
multifaceted one we want to maintain a
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
keeping the profession in the state of
 
01:35:52.109 --> 01:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um of the the level that
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's at right now when you come from
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
another state and you see what the
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
standard is to be a law enforcement
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
officer in New Hampshire you realize how
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
high that standard is and we do
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
everything in our power to maintain that
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh that standard and make sure that
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
we're always using best practices when
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
we uh recruit we hire we train uh and we
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
we try to retain uh the officers that
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
are working out there because it's very
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
important it's a great job it's the best
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
job in the world um but it's it comes
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
with a lot of challenges
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
um so as an organization when we meet we
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
have perspectives from a town like
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
ainson which is small and then you get
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
the perspective from Chiefs and command
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
level people from a conquor a Manchester
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
or an asash to hear the issues that uh
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
of concern to them because a lot of
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
times we see the same things small town
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
large community just at a different
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
volume so our our job is is very
 
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.189 align:start position:0%
volume so our our job is is very
complicated

01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:36:56.109 --> 01:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of different things one of
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
the most important parts of the
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
organization is working with committees
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
like this in legislation because our
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
primary focus is to keep New Hampshire
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
one of the safest if not the safest
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
state in the country to live it and
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's that comes with a lot of
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility because uh we we don't
 
01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
police the state of New Hampshire we
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
protect the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's a fine line to that so as an
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
organization that's what we try to do
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
and it's not always easy um and it's
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
always up for discussion because we have
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and it it's great
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to one of the things that
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
I've learned and I've only been here
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
since 18 and part of this organization
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
but coming to the state house or going
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
to different committee meetings is the
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
ability and the willingness of people to
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
listen and to work together and to come
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
up with Solutions when it's a challenge
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
because our perspective of what we see
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
in your perspective of what you see are
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
different in a lot of
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
cases in in the experience that's part
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
of this organization uh can't be
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
replaced you have I mean I'm I'm in year
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
42 and you have um some officers that
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
have been on less than 10 years that are
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
now Chiefs or commanders in their
 
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
organizations so as much as you get
 
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
changes in technology and scrutiny and
 
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
um ways of solving crimes when a crime
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
commits you got to go out and you got to
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
solve it you got to work with evidence
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
you got to work with the science and you
 
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
got to come up with a uh somebody and
 
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
hold them responsible for what they did
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
and that's all all well and good but our
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
primary focus is trying to prevent that
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
crime from happening in the first place
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what we do and when we meet
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we try to maintain that
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
Focus so from the hiring Personnel to
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
get the right people on the job training
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
them and always updating that and
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining the high level of standard
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has that's uh that's
 
01:38:57.709 --> 01:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
what our organization does and it's it's
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
interesting to see um and listen to
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
people who have been in different
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
agencies or different situations whether
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
they've been in training or uh lawyers
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
and in um it it's it's been a great
 
01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:12.440 align:start position:0%
learning experience and I really look
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
forward to this year um because we want
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
to maintain that high quality of life of
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and I'd be
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions or
 
01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.990 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions or
comments

01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Chief um I I I asked this
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
question um I I am finishing up a term
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
as police commissioner in Portsmouth and
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of of implementing
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
a body camps in Portsmith it was a long
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
time coming but we're doing that do you
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
have a so two questions do you have a
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
any sense of how many departments in New
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now have body camps and second
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
question is what if anything can the
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
legislature do to uh encourage other uh
 
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
particularly smaller departments that
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
don't have them to get
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
them um I don't have an exact percentage
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
I know that it grows every year you see
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
more departments with them and at some
 
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
point we will have them I I think
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
they're a great tool um one of the
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
things that kept smaller agencies from
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
doing it is the expense and and not to
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
get into a body cam discussion but
 
01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:25.719 align:start position:0%
buying the camera
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
is the least of the cost it's the
 
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
storage and the redaction um I worked in
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
the city of LOL before I came up here
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
the middle sex County district attorney
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
said if you people go to body cams which
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
they've since gone to I will have to
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
hire five additional Adas just to do
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
video storage redaction and what
 
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
presentation so there's a lot of
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
companies now there's little more
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
competition so the the cost is coming
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
down um I think if there's grant
 
01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.589 align:start position:0%
down um I think if there's grant
opportunities

01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
for um for smaller agencies like ourself
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
I mean we could buy it now but then to
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
maintain it um it's it's it's cost
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
prohibitive right now but the cost is
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
coming down because the competition is
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
going up thank you you're
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Chief thank you very
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
much we'll see you at some point
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the year I'm sure oh no doubt
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks um
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
we have let me see from the ACLU um
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
oh thank you everybody um chairman
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is my
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
first time speaking in the L so I am new
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
as of this summer to the ACLU of New
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Amanda aad I'm the policy
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
director I was previously in the past
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
with the ACLU of Arizona um very happy
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be here prefer the weather um over
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
over the desert for sure I'm going to
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
keep it very brief and I have business
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
cards I'm happy to chat with anyone or
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
connect you all with other folks in our
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
office if that's ever
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
helpful um I just want to give a very
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
brief overview of what the ACLU is the
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union um and
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
then just show my face get to see you
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
all um looking forward to being here in
 
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
the future um so the ACLU itself is an
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
organization that's been around for over
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
a 100 years um the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
was founded in the
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
60s we are a
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh nonpartisan organization
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
that does not accept any government
 
01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.109 align:start position:0%
that does not accept any government
funding

01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
um we are also importantly to note a
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
membership organization so we have over
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
150 U million members as of now and we
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
preserve the individual rights and
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
Liberties guaranteed by the Constitution
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
so we like to think of the Bill of
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
Rights in the Constitution as our
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
client so we have different buckets of
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
work a lot of which you will all see but
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
much of it you will not see here at the
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislature um so we of course do
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
litigation something that's we're very
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
well known for um we've gone for example
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court more than any other
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
organization except for the Department
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
of Justice um so we are certainly an
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
organization with many many attorneys we
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
also do legislative advocacy we also do
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
importantly education in the community
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
know your rights um so that individuals
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
can represent themselves they can
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
advocate for thems and they understand
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
their rights under the law lastly we do
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of organizing Within the community
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
again we think it's really important for
 
01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
individuals to be able to protect
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and stand up for
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
themselves so we focus on equality and
 
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
fighting discrimination for over a
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
hundred years that goes from the
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
Japanese internment cases to segregation
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
in schools and interracial marriage um
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
to the different issues that we're
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
seeing today one of the really big
 
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
issues that we're going to come before
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
this Committee in particular and talk
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
about is mass incarceration um of the
 
01:44:26.229 --> 01:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
speakers today have addressed that issue
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
um it's something that's been really
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming for some time
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
now um we care deeply about defending
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
the rights of those coming in contact
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
with the criminal legal system so there
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
are many many different issue areas
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
within the criminal justice system that
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
we address um mass
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration being at the top of the
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
list government overreach um government
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
transparency is very important to us due
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
process pre-trial confin
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
um the list goes on racial disparities
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
and much much more I just want to flag
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
some very basic things and then I'll let
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
you um chat with everyone else waiting
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
here today um the US currently spends
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
over 80 billion dollar on
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration um and that is just a
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
mind-blowing number and I don't know the
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
exact dollar amount for New Hampshire
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure we spend a great deal um
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
some related work that all might have
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
questions about in the future is uh
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
privacy and Technology we cover that
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
free speech is something that we're best
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
known for and very proud of um we do
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
immigrants rights Juvenile Justice and
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
many other issues we have defended many
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
controversial and unpopular groups um
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
because we believe strongly in the right
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
to free expression and free assembly and
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
other constitutional rights and we are
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
proud of that um once the government has
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
the power to violate one person's rights
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
um can be use that power against anyone
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
and everyone and that's something that
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
we think of quite a bit in our office
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.830 align:start position:0%
here in New
Hampshire

01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
um so one of our main concerns we
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerate our people more than any
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
other country by far um for just to put
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
this in context we are 5% of the world's
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
population here in the United States we
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
are more than 20% of the people who are
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
in prison um so it's just truly
 
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
mindboggling when you look at the data
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the numbers around incarceration
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
um I myself I'm happy to meet with any
 
01:46:29.350 --> 01:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
of you all and I hope to get to know you
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
while we work together going forward um
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
I've covered a lot of unique issues from
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
religious freedom something that's also
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
very important to the ACLU I've worked
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
with uh tribal students native students
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
on being able to wear tribal regalia at
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
school graduations um I've done
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
litigation surrounding First Amendment
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
and protesting um prison conditions and
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
the right to Medical Care and pregnancy
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
and postpartum supplies while
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated is something that's been
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
really important um and addressing
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
disparities and school ARR rest and
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
privilege of being being able to work
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
with you over the years I think this is
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
my sixth uh legislative session um I
 
01:49:30.270 --> 01:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
know they go by really quickly um but we
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
are just so grateful to be able to work
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
with you um from year to year on these
 
01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
critical issues like Amanda said I'm the
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
public policy specialist at the
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
Coalition um but we do have a team um
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
that keeps an eye on legislation and you
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
also will probably see some of our
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
program um uh colleagues who work on
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
issue areas that I'll highlight in a
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
little bit um throughout the session as
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
well um so so we um are the um the
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
umbrella Organization for the 12 U
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
member programs across the state who
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
operate crisis centers and Emergency
 
01:50:07.229 --> 01:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
Shelters um and cover issues of domestic
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault stalking child
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and human trafficking um and so we
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
are you know very present in this
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
committee um and I've brought um some
 
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
materials that I'll pass around to all
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
of you um just to highlight a few key
 
01:50:25.550 --> 01:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
statistics um a handout specifically on
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of trauma I know we just heard
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the cost of
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
incarceration but I think the other side
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the coin is the cost of victimization
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's a really helpful
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
handout just to know that there's a
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
lifetime cost that comes especially for
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
those abused as children um but even
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
into adulthood um and an economic impact
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
that we have not only on individuals but
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
on the state and uh country as well um
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
as well as a policy brief on human
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking I know that's a really big
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
issue area um and so we are happy to
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
highlight that um and a few other
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
materials as well so hopefully they'll
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
be helpful to you all um but we are just
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
grateful to be a resource um so as I
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%

Organization for the 12 member programs
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%

01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
Coalition is working on Statewide policy
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%

entire spectrum of folks that may be
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
impacted by these issues um and try to
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
be as collaborative as possible um and I
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the rare issues um
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
the Amanda mentioned that really has
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
broad bipartisan support and tremendous
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
public support for victims of crime in
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
the state um and as a result we have
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
some of the strongest laws and protocols
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the nation um and that's all a part
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
of the great work that you all do here
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
and just the dedication to these issues
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
um and so you know we just really
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate you know the hard work that
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
you do in this committee um when we
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
bring forward legislation or when we
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
weigh in on proposals we really try to
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
be um you know as as careful as we can
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
when we're vetting these things um
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
usually when we're testifying we've
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
already run it by several other
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um just to get a sense of
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know what not only what the the the
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
principle of the policy is but how that
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
is going to implement on the ground um
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
because I think implementation and
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement of policies is the most
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of doing um impactful
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
work in the state um so we really try to
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
heavily vet all of these proposals and
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
just um be great resource if we don't
 
01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
have the answers um we are happy to find
 
01:52:58.030 --> 01:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
the right person uh to sit in front of
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
you to help guide um and and provide
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
that information um and I think it's
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
just really important that um we try to
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
come with a very balanced perspective um
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that Public Safety
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
um is at the core of what we do um and
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
we aren't trying to tip the scales of
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
Justice um because there are victims of
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence um but
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
they're also savvy abusers who know to
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
operate within the system um and it's
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
important to really look holistically at
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
these processes um so we're not just
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
here yes we're here advocating on behalf
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
of victims and our crisis centers um but
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
we really just want the most effective
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
and efficient system that we possibly
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
can have in New Hampshire um and so
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's why this is just such an
 
01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
important um process for us
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
um and then so just kind of like an
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
overview of our um legislative work and
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%

happy to answer questions happy to help
 
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
look into issues um you'll probably see
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%

resources for your constituents um so

01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
programs within this is also our
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
catchment map um so you can see where
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
those are located and their contact
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
information um we serve um our member
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
programs serve around
 
01:54:27.709 --> 01:54:27.719 align:start position:0%
15,000 um victims of crime every year um
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to doing uh prevention
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
education in the communities um we also
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
operate 11 Emergency Shelters um and
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
those shelters provide shelter to around
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
400 adults and children annually um so
 
01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
um they're key part to communities um
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
crisis centers um provide an array of
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
services and referrals including access
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
to confidential Advocates um like I
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned emergency shelter and housing
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
um as well as helping find a placement
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
um in transitional housing um and just
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know being an immediate resource
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
they can for folks fleeing uh violence
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
um as well as economic justice so I
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
offsetting the costs of any sort of
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
financial abuse that may occur um as
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
well as funding uh for immediate basic
 
01:55:16.069 --> 01:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
needs um many survivors just don't have
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
groceries or phone cards or gas or rent
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
um and so we really want to make sure
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
that them and their children are able to
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
get those basic needs as quickly as
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
possible um they also provide safety
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
planning uh conne connection to legal
 
01:55:31.629 --> 01:55:31.639 align:start position:0%
services so you heard the Chief Justice
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
speak this morning um working within the
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
court um to provide services is a a
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of the work that they
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
do um as well as Hospital advocacy and
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
accomp accompaniment especially in
 
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
sexual assault cases um as well as then
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
just being a connection to Community
 
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
Resources such as mental health
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
substance use treatment um and so on so
 
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
um you know our
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
victims in New Hampshire often um have
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know an array of services that they
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
need and I think that goes back to the
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
cost of trauma um that I mentioned
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
earlier um so the the core thing is
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
really just making sure that folks have
 
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
what they need to get back on their feet
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
um and be stable in their
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
communities um I just wanted to quickly
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
highlight um a couple of our programs um
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned that are under our
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
umbrella um so the first one is the um
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
human trafficking collaborative task
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
force um so New Hampshire has a
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
partnership that is dedicated to
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
improving the Statewide response to
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
human trafficking um and so the
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
Coalition helps direct that and um
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
partners with key stakeholders including
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice Homeland
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
Security um investigation State Police
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh us attorneys crisis center Advocates
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
um you know legal representatives and so
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
on um to help ensure that victims of
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
human trafficking whether it's labor orx
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking um have the resources
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
they need but that also we can address
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
these um horrific cases um and um like I
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a policy brief on that
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
but that's something that if you are
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
interested in learning more about the
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
programming and and what that looks like
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um because it's
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
everything from you know uh crossborder
 
01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
you know truck stop um sex trafficking
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
to unfortunately you know familial
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
trafficking where we see children um you
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately being impact Ed by
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
this um so it looks a little different
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
but it happens in all corners of the
 
01:57:29.310 --> 01:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
state unfortunately um so this is a huge
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
issue we'd be happy to speak more on and
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
and be a resource on um and then I think
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
like um the other one that I think is
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
really uh relevant to your committee is
 
01:57:41.069 --> 01:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
the sexual assault nurse examiner
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
program I know um me uh representatives
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
of that program have come in in the past
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
to talk about anything related to sexual
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
assault cases um whether it's um you
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
know D analysis rape kits uh physical
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
injuries and things like that so um
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
those experts um both me um medical
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
experts are able to come in and talk
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
more about what they're seeing and how
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
we can best uh respond to those cases as
 
01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
well um so I think before I just wrap up
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
um I just want to remind you that we're
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
a resource um and we're happy to be here
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
um to help um and we like really try to
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
be as responsive as possible so please
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
call Amanda and I anytime for anything
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
um we will always make ourselves

01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to be our last presenter
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
for the day I just wanted to go over a
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
few things with the committee members
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
that I haven't had a chance to talk to
 
02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:01.990 align:start position:0%
that I haven't had a chance to talk to
you

02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
yet those of you who were here last year
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
you kind of know how I operate those of
 
02:00:09.069 --> 02:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
you who are new uh may not I'm going to
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
ask for the same things we did last year
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
because it was very successful um we are
 
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
Democrats and we are Republicans but I
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
would ask that we maintain between
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves and this committee a certain
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
level of collegial
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and that includes not bashing each
 
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
other on social media um on X or where
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
is it there are plenty of other
 
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
Democrats and plenty of other
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
Republicans that you can bash over the
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
head on social media um but leave the
 
02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
ones in this committee alone if you
 
02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
don't mind um it makes it easier for us
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
to work together so I would appreciate
 
02:00:44.189 --> 02:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
that and um I would appreciate that if
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
you are not going to be here let your
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
ranking member or myself or the vice
 
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
chairman know that you're not going to
 
02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
be here especially on Executive session
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
days so that they have a chance to get a
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
replacement for you and was there
 
02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:01.030 align:start position:0%
replacement for you and was there
anything

02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
on oh yeah um when we have people come
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
in and testify a lot of times we have
 
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
victims of crimes come in here and
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
testify and I know i' we've addressed
 
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
this already with Republicans but um if
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
it's a victim of a crime and or the for
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
example the mother of someone who was
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
passed away from a crime I would ask
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
unless it's absolutely necessary to not
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
ask them questions let them give their
 
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
testimony we will be heartfelt and thank
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
you very much for sharing and we feel
 
02:01:35.950 --> 02:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know and let them go and I think
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's about it um remember while we're
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
asking questions in this committee We're
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
very professional we want to get answers
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
we don't want no gotas it's just if you
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
already know the answer don't ask them
 
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's to elicit information so we want to
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
do that I run a very kind of loose
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee I like it everyone to talk we
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
learn more when we talk so I'm not a
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
real stickler for you know um
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily I don't want to say the
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
rules but I'm not I'm not you know that
 
02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not a stickler so if you have a
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
question you raise your hand I'll let
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
you go I usually don't stop people I let
 
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
them talk um as long as we don't abuse
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
that I don't have to start using that
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
stupid Hammer go ahead thank you Mr
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
chair just wondering if you have a sense
 
02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
of what days we'll be meeting yeah we're
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to be doing we we have Thursdays
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
and Fridays and occasional Wednesday
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays we share with ways and means
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
they have Monday Tuesdays and occasional
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays will SP depending on it's a
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's a money year so they're going to
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
have priority so I would like to do just
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
like I did last year if the people that
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
weren't here um we got out of here early
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
um I'd rather stay here in the winter
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
when it's nasty and be free when the
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
weather gets nice so we're going to
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
knock these things out we're going to be
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
done way before our deadline and we'll
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
only have to come back for session days
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
and I hope you guys are agree with
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
that's the best way to do it I don't
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
want to hang around here all all all
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
spring because remember we go to June
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
and I had us out of here last year when
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
was it um April we were done yeah so I
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
want to do that again this year and we
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
had 50 bills uh representative
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
Muse one of the the major differences
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
between this year and uh and the
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
previous session is uh the the change in
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
the rules around uh noticing of
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
executive sessions yeah and I know that
 
02:03:21.599 --> 02:03:22.310 align:start position:0%
executive sessions yeah and I know that
uh

02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
committee chairs have a lot of
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
discretion I also know that we deal with
 
02:03:25.639 --> 02:03:26.470 align:start position:0%
discretion I also know that we deal with
some

02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
extremely complicated bills and it one
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the worst one of the worst parts of
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
being a legislator can be showing up for
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
a series of hearings on totally
 
02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
different issues and then immediately
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
after those hearings have to do an
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
executive session on a bill you haven't
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
thought about in three weeks and I I'm
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
just curious how you intend to kind of
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
navigate through that this year I I it's
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
too for me all those gotcha executive
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
sessions are are too complicated I I I
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
want to notice them the traditional way
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
if I put a notice in the calendar that
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
says executive session may be held then
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
we may hold it that day but I will let
 
02:04:05.270 --> 02:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
the ranking member know in the morning
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
um there's going to be no surprise exact
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
haha it's not how I operate and
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
um no laptops DAV yeah I I thought it
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
might be helpful I know um uh for the
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
new members to maybe uh meet uh Brad and
 
02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
maybe get an understanding of why he's
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
sitting there at that desk typing away
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
madly and he's like the and how he can
 
02:04:31.149 --> 02:04:31.159 align:start position:0%

02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
have actually been here before 10 times
 
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.040 align:start position:0%

02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
up and say this is what you guys voted
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%

02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay if anyone didn't get that where's
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
the printing policy you said it should
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
be at our desk we didn't see
 
02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
it if you send one to every member so
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
they understand the printing policy and
 
02:06:05.069 --> 02:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
how to go about getting amendments that
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
would be awesome I would appreciate it
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%

like a crazy talk I'm sure um if you
 
02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:17.800 align:start position:0%

02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%

laptops I don't mind I what I don't want
 
02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
to see is walls of laptops I know David
 
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
has a condition and that's fine if you
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
need your computer that's fine um if you
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
need to to get something look up
 
02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
something what I don't want to see
 
02:06:55.629 --> 02:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
please is people we I've seen before who
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
would be doing gotcha stuff like looking
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the thing hey well it says right here
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
that you did this no um but other than
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
that you know how I am I'm fine yes I
 
02:07:07.069 --> 02:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
just want to say I appreciate that
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
because it's helpful sometimes when
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a law yeah and it it
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
goes to a par I mean talking about a
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
particular law and you need to know how
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that affects a particular law
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's easier if you can get access to the
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
law and then see how to do and that's
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
what yeah I just while while someone's
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
testifying I'd rather not see a wall of
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
laptops but if we're getting into a
 
02:07:32.109 --> 02:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
exact session or we're looking up
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
something that's absolutely okay with me
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate that no thanks
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
else it's it's
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
hard when we're doing it ex when we're
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
doing an executive I'm sorry we're doing
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
a hearing if they get my attention and
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
I'll write their name down so people
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
oh yeah if you have a question and I'm
 
02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
focused on the person testifying get
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
Jen's attention so she or or um Ally my
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
clerk one of their attentions so I know
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
that there's a question out there
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
because I can't see to my left like
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
David I I won't see him past these
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
people and the same thing if you have a
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
question make sure you get one of their
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
attention and I'll call in you just go
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%

see you and I'll I'll write your name
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
down that way you don't have to just
 
02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
keep on raising your hand or thinking
 
02:08:25.069 --> 02:08:25.079 align:start position:0%
