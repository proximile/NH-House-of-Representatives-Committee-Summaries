good morning welcome to Edna I'm opening
 
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 610 and
 
00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
Barry good
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
morning was here yesterday for election
 
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
law so kind of weird to be on the other
 
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
end of this uh my name is representative
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
rosb I represent the town of gos aware
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
in Hillsboro 44 I'm here to introduce
 
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 610 FN relative to repealing
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer Advocate
 
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
which isn't really quite a accurate
 
00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
title because it doesn't really repeal
 
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
it it just more folds it into the
 
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy um because I don't
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
think you're going to find the political
 
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
will to outright get rid of it so let's
 
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
kind of discuss what's happening so the
 
00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
OCA uh was invented I think the 80s it
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually predates the department of
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
energy by quite some time um when the
 
00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
department of energy was spun out a
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
couple years ago it basically kind of
 
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
created this situation where you had the
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
Pu the uh OCA and the department of
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
energy so the office of the consumer
 
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
Advocate has about five employees uh uh
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate themselves is
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
either required to be an attorney or
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
their assistant is required to be an
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
attorney um it's mostly staffed by
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys versus the department of
 
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
energy has about 80 employees um
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
obviously they both deal in energy
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
policies the office of the consumer
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
Advocate is tasked with the name that it
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
is given it is supposed to advocate for
 
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer the residential rate paay
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
in particular uh on utilities it's
 
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to go in and push a objective
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
of lowering rates for the utilities for
 
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 align:start position:0%
the consumers uh it's funded by its own
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
special tax um it's funded by a tax on
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
the rate payers uh which is actually
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
kind of hilarious when you think that
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
its function is to reduce the rate costs
 
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
and it actually by its existence
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
increases them um it's a it's a small
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
tax it has about a million dollar a year
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
budget um so it's not like you know this
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
would be a life-saving cut to the budget
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
or anything like that or you know there
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
would be a massive reduction but I do
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
think its funding mechanism on its own
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
is kind of uh thetical to its operation
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
that it's a Exist by raising TA by
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
raising the rates um so the reason I
 
00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
think that this office would be better
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
suited inside the department of energy
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
is the Department of energy is a much
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
larger and more powerful now bureaucracy
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see the department of
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
energy overall tasked with the job that
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
the OCA is currently tasked with I'd
 
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
like to see the department of Energy's
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
focus on lowering the rates of for
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
residential payers um and it's kind of
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
like the equivalent of bringing a knife
 
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
to a gunfight right you've got a five
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
person office you've got an 80 person
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
office why don't we take the objective
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
for the five person office which I would
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
assume that everybody in here probably
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
agrees with on face value lowering
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
residential R pair and give it to the
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
larger more powerful bureaucracy by
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
folding it in um so you'll get some
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
you'll get some cost cost reductions
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
that way streamlining things um because
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
right now the OCA operates that's what's
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
called an attached agency um so the doe
 
00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 align:start position:0%
offers kind of support services to the
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
OCA so it can function because at five
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
people it cannot stand on its own um
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some things that are
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
brought up that I think should just be
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
addressed right off the bat the very
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
first thing that they're going to say uh
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill is they're going
 
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
to say that the OCA is independent that
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's politically neutral it is
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
independent is a total falsehood the OCA
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
is appointed through a political process
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Ed of of Ed of
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
Education the commission of energy is
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and appointed
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
by the executive Council the OCA
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
receives a nomination from a politically
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
appointed board that is then given to
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
the governor who then nominates to the
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
executive Council who then confirms the
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
appointment so they both undergo a
 
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
political process so if you had an OCA
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a statement about the current
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
OCA if you had an OCA that was
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
self-interested and wanted to keep their
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
job they would do what the governor and
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
the council wanted because if they're up
 
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
for a nomination that's what they're
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to do the exact same thing by the
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
way that the commissioner of Education
 
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
would do the commission I keep saying
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
education Commissioner of energy would
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
do um if they were interested in self-
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
reappointment they're not politically
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
neutral they go through an inherently
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
political process so this notion that
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're independent is just a falsehood
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's they're not independent they are
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
appointed through a political process if
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
politicians don't like how the OCA is
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
operating they change they they appoint
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the board that nominates him and that's
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
the end of it it's done so a
 
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
self-interested OCA I'm not saying the
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
current OCA self-interested I'm just
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
saying a self-interested OCA would
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
actually respond to political pressures
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to keep their job so
 
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's just you can look up how how it
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
goes that's how it is um this would
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
create government uh this would create
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
more efficiency because now right now
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
when Regulators are or anybody's
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
bringing a kind of an energy policy
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
through they they have to go to pu doe
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
and OCA we can just fold that in and
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
have one less bureaucracy to deal with
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
and just deal with doe whose Now new job
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh will be to uh promote the lowering of
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers um a couple of
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
other things why I think this is is
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
useful um
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
I I think the question I think the
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
question should be asked um what has the
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
OCA over its history done to actually
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
lower rates um I did a pretty deep dive
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't find anything um right
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
off the bat uh the number one thing that
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
I found was it was pretty instrumental
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire saves program so if
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with the New
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program it's basically
 
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
like a rebate uh that you can get for to
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
do some energy efficient upgrades um and
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
then I looked at well how's the New
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves program funded it's
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
funded through a tax on the utilities
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
which is then passed right back on down
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
the consumers so the consu so that's not
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
increasing the benefit for the rate
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
payers you're just jacking up their
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
costs to do a program that could lower
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
the cost for some um so that's picking
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
winners and losers that's not cool um
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is today uh I've been
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
told that some of the utilities are
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
going to testify why they think the OCA
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
should stay um so it's
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
if the OCA is supposed to be advocating
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
for lower rates it's inherently put into
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
an adversarial position with the utility
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
companies right utility companies are
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
inherently going to be profit motivated
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing wrong with being profit
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
motivated by the way there's nothing
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
wrong with that but their job is to make
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
money their companies that's what they
 
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
do so if the utilities which are profit
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
motivated which they make more money
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
when rates go up is here to say let's
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
keep the
 
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
OCA you should ask yourself the question
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
why are they doing that um and I I think
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty I think it's a pretty
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
damning assertation of you're you're
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
here to say that the person that's
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
supposed to fight you should stay that
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
would imply that they're either not
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
doing a great job of it and they're okay
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
if that office stays because maybe it
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
bite um or they don't think that the OCA
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
is effective and you know a weak
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate is would be more
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
preoccupied with things like regulatory
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
policies than lowering consumer rates
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we've seen a lot of that so we've
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
seen the current OCA uh testified in
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
favor of changing the building codes
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
from I believe the 2018 standard to the
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
2021 standard I may have the dates wrong
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
but the OCA testified in favor of that
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
so current OCA so some interesting facts
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
about that that would add about $331,000
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
to the cost of a mortgage um which
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
equates to about $
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
21159 a month based at a 7% interest
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
rate it would take you 48 years to
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
recoup that money as a residential rate
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
payer from your mortgage uh and that was
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
based that 48e statistic is actually
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
based on a 4% mortgage so it's probably
 
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
closer to like 56 to 60 years before you
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
would ever see that money back so when
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
you have an office that's kind of taken
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
its quote Independence and is maybe
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
veing into the realm of unaccountable
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
you would see them do things like that
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
like they've done where they've
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
advocated for policies that are actually
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
hurting the residents maybe not the
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
residential rate payer but the residents
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
of the state um and I think that that
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
should be addressed by this body uh when
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
people come up to defend it um which
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
they understandably will so kind of
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
bringing it all um back I'm just going
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
through my notes here because I have a
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
lot of notes here um oh uh one other
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
thing that's going to get brought up I'm
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
glad I wrote it down um somebody is is
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to say the doe Department of
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
energy just does what the governor wants
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
I want to bring you back to how the OCA
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
is appointed the OCA is appointed by the
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
governor so if you Levy that accusation
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
you also have to Levy that accusation at
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
the OCA and the OCA can deny that um and
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
maybe the current OCA doesn't but this
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
isn't about the current OCA this is
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
about the OCA office in general you may
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
get an OCA in the future that just does
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
what the governor wants because if they
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
want to be reappointed what's the
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
easiest way to do it keep the governor
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
happy um because that's how you get
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
reappointed um but by taking the charge
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the OCA and giving it statutorily to
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
the doe you actually restrain the doe um
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit and you focus it in to
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
advocate for the residential rapay um
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
which I would hope everyone would agree
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
should be the objective of the doe it
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't actually just be a mouthpiece
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
for the governor as they're about to
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
tell you that's what it is I think the
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
doe should be focused on lowering rates
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
and there's things that are lower to
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
rates that as a conservative I don't
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
like and there's things to lower rates
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
as a conservative that I do like um I
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
think that the current policies of the
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
OCA seem very focused on efficiency um
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
and not focused on energy Generation Um
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
the an easy example is our current OCA
 
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
was endorsed by a group called no gas no
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
coal now I'm not trying to make a
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
statement about climate change actually
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
happened to be one of the Republicans
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
who believes in climate change um I
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
believe in carbon's emissions and and
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
that sort of things and how it does have
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
an effect on the earth um however I also
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
happen to be pretty well versed in how
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
ISO New England extension New Hampshire
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
gets its energy generation it's mostly
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
through natural gas uh natural gas
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
creates what's called great Baseline
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
energy Baseline energy um base load
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
energy is basically the energy that's
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
always available right so wind and solar
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
are not always available um if the if
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
the wind's not blowing or the sun's not
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
shining there's no generation that's not
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
basow generation natural gas nuclear are
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
our two main sources of Base load
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
generation we saw what happened to
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
residential Rays when the war in Ukraine
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
started and all of a sudden the Russian
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
natural gas market was disrupted right
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
the rat shot through the roof so we know
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
we know we know that when natural gas is
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
disrupted in New Hampshire that the
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
residential rates go up it's it's an
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
indisputable fact because it happened so
 
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
why is our current OCA endorsed by a
 
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.870 align:start position:0%
why is our current OCA endorsed by a
group

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
called no gas no coal whose Express
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
purpose is to get rid of
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
gas he's they're endorsed by a group
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
who's that group who exists for two
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
reasons to ban gas and to ban coal
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
looked at our current OCA and said great
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
job we like that we're endorsing
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
that I would venture to you that maybe
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
this office has kind of gotten out of
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
its Lane maybe it's no longer serving
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
its purpose and I want to get it back to
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
its original purpose and I think it will
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
be far more effective if it's rolled
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
into the department of energy with that
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative ree thank you
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
chair uh Madam chairwoman um
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative Barry thank you so much
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
uh you cited a couple a figure
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
$31,000 um to would be added to the cost
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
of a mortgage um regardless of how long
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
it takes to pay back I'm just curious
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
where you got that $31,000 because we
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
had testimony I think earlier this year
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
where the Builders Association said
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
$222,000 per house and then we had
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else saying it was on the on
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
the order of magnitude of 2,000 to 3,000
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
so could you share that yeah so I pulled
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
it uh this actually actually pulled this
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
morning from the national Builders
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
Association uh they had a they had a
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
white paper out about it and um it
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
actually broke it down the majority of
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
that cost was actually in sheetrock um
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
it actually broke it down by cost so um
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
I felt when they were breaking down the
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
price increases that it was probably
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
just not a number that they made up and
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send it to the committee
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
so I would like to I have a question
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
about the intent of the bill you're
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
moving the scope of the current Office
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
of Consumer
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
Advocate essentially unchanged to the
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
Department of energy do I understand
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
that correctly or am I mistaken that is
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
my intention uh this is one of those
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
bills that uh OS I was given one redraft
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
and not a lot of opportunities to change
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
it um but that is that was my my initial
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
instructions was remove the Office and
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
then in my fact finding I said actually
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
it may not be wise to just eliminate it
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
um because it is serving a function the
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
actual intention of it is good um so in
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
my fact finding of in my fact finding of
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
should we remove this I went actually no
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
we should actually just fold it in it'll
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
be more effective um so I don't want to
 
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
entirely eliminate the responsibilities
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
I just think that the much larger more
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
powerful bureaucracy of doe should be
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
tasked with this and this office of five
 
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
people should be folded into it um
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
because when I was doing the process my
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
kind of fact finding and I discovered
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
how the OCA was nominated and
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
confirmed I quickly realized that's a
 
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
confirmed I quickly realized that's a
political

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
nomination there's a political
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
nomination here there's a political
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
nomination here these are both political
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
nominations so the assertation that it's
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
independent is just inherently false and
 
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have two political
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
bodies you might as well have the big
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
one be focused on the people so you can
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
get you can fold the little one into the
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
big one make the big one now focused on
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
the people and I think it'll be far more
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
effective and you may actually see some
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
rates go down okay and if I read it
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
correctly there are still the consumer
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate the assistant consumer Advocate
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
and the secretary that are specified as
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
necessary staff and then outside
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
Consultants so
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
so so it appears that you're expecting
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to U make it a
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
three-person office rather than a five
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
person office correct yeah so you get
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
rid of two positions um and you'll
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
you'll also make it easier on businesses
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
who now have to instead of having to go
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
to three agency or they have to go to
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
way more than three to be fair but um
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
they you're just reducing one less
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
agency that they have to go to and
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
you're reassigning that focus and
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
function to the larger bureaucracy thank
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
you other representative
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
grota hi so you say sorry thank you um
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you say that the rates may go down yeah
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
so but they may
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
not it's it's I would I would contend
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
you could make that argument now and I
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
would actually say they're not going
 
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.789 align:start position:0%
would actually say they're not going
down

00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
now an easy question to ask is what have
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
they done to lower rates no no I'm
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
asking excuse me followup followup you
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
say that by eliminating this the P the
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
the the uh fee or whatever you want to
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
call it that's being added to the
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
electrical rates now
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
would be eliminated that would be
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
eliminated but I'm I'm going tell you
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
the the a million dollars distributed
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
over a monthly bill over every
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
residential rate payer that you're not
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
going to see a a massive change just by
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
limiting the office um because it's a
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars distributed over every
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
residential rate payer every bill every
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
month right um so to make that argument
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
would be very disingenuous but I point
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
that out because the existence of the
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
office is inherently antithetical when
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's funded by a tax on the R pairs
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
which by the way I would point out you
 
00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
don't get to opt out of right um so when
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
the independent OCA takes a position you
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
are funding that through Force um which
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
is by the way as a person who's followed
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
me politically you know that I hate
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
forced speech doesn't matter who's doing
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
it um and you are effectively saying
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
that you must agree with the the a
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
residential Ray must agree with that
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
position because you're taking their
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
money by
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
force um thank you gr so you're thinking
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
that in 80 e person agency that
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
basically approves the increases of
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
electrical rates because that's what
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
they do is going to have a they do right
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
when when rise when somebody wants it
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
increase they have to go to the Pu and
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
justify it y but this is going to doe
 
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.789 align:start position:0%
justify it y but this is going to doe
not

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
pu I'm not putting the same organization
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
they're not the same organization sorry
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
I misunderstood that but please don't
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
don't don't Badger the the testifier
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so uh
 
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative Barry do you believe that
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh energy rates would be lowered if
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
demand is lower I'm sorry do you believe
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
that energy rates would be lower if
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
demand is lowered of course they would
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
but not in exchange for a $211 increase
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
to your rent and mortgage followup
 
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.270 align:start position:0%
to your rent and mortgage followup
please

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we're not here to argue with the
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
testifiers yes
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
followup so uh New Hampshire saves uh
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
which you mentioned helps families uh
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
make their households more energy
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
efficient icient um so uh do you believe
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
that enough if enough households were
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
part of that program that that would
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
decrease uh energy demand possibly
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
however New Hampshire saves is funded by
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
taxing every single residential rayer so
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying if you don't
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
participate in it you just pay more I
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
have nothing against New Hampshire saves
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
in fact quite honestly I've looked into
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
using it um because I'm a big fan of
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
heat pumps once again Republican who
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
believes in climate
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
change the OCA should be focused in my
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
opinion should be focused more on
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
generation because that is actually
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
Supply is actually the issue lowering
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
Demand on energy is very hard it's not
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
to me that you ignore it but the fact
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
that we have an OCA willing to tack on
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
$211 59 to a mortgage it takes 48 years
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
on the low end to get back says that
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
maybe the focus isn't in the right place
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
maybe they're too focused on there's a
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
term that they use all the time it's
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
like a societal benefit um and they
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
basically use that as a justification to
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
ignore what you need to do which is get
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
generation going um and I'll give you an
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
example of things that you could
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
advocate for that would lower the the
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
rate of residential rap pairs in the
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
next two to three years you could sign a
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
letter to the uh uh to Congress or to
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
the president saying please allow FK to
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
build a natural gas pipeline through New
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
York which has banned natural gas
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
pipelines entirely which if you
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand geography in order to get to
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
New England you got to go through New
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
York right or you could advocate for C
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
Brook getting its defunct second pad up
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
and running because
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
the second largest and sometimes largest
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
Bas load generator in New Hampshire for
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
ISO New England is nuclear nuclear is a
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
clean energy by the way um but we don't
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
see those sort of behaviors we see a
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
focus on efficiency which has underlying
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
issues regarding a an ideology um and
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
not a focus on building new generation
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
that new generation by the way that can
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
be wind that can be solar that can be
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
nuclear that can be gas that can be
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it is but if the charge is to
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
lower rates there seems to be very
 
00:22:59.950 --> 00:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
little focus on Supply and a whole lot
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
of focus on efficiency which has
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
ideological undertones thank you thank
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair uh
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative Barry so by this bill
 
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying here technically there's
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going from five to
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
three people so automatically there's
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
two savings at that point if I
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
understand correctly and I I'm sure sure
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
there would be a space savings as well
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
so this would be passed on to the people
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah and and you would
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
and once again I don't want to be
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
disingenuous with the argument there's
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
not going to be a massive reduction in
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
in your bill by folding this office into
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the other I'm actually more interested
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
in giving
 
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
doe the Mandate that the OCA currently
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
has because it's a bigger stronger
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy it's a lot easier to push
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
around a five person agency where if one
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
person quits retires you lose 20% of
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
your Workforce right than it is to push
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
around an 80% bureaucracy and it also
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
gets that 80% bureaucracy regardless of
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
who the governor is focused on what I
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
would imagine everybody in this room is
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
would agree on a bipartisan basis that
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
thing um thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
you representative um so am I
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly that this bill
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
would make the mission statement of the
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um include lowering
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers um cost that's
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
my goal of it um it would uh the OCA
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
does have a case load too that it has to
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
handle um so they would take over that
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
case load and that language about case
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
loading is specifically in here um
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
because there are concerns that a single
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
rate payer cannot you know Joe Joe Schmo
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
cannot go to two hearings a week um
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
can't advocate for themselves can't
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
fight the utilities I think that's you
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
know I have an issue with that on on a
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
philosophical level of of going into
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
government but if we're going to say
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
that that should exist which is what the
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
current stance of the legislation I
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
would just give that to the bigger more
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
powerful bureaucracy if we're going to
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
say that it should be doing these things
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's give it the bigger weapon to go do
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
it follow follow up so followup so then
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
the mission would be to go to these
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
hearings and fight for the little guy
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
and make the mission statement of the
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to lower all of our
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
constituents prop U Energy prices
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
correct that would be that would be my
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
goal of it yes thank you okay
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you madam
 
00:25:25.919 --> 00:25:31.190 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you madam
chair

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
but is the concept here with the
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
movement of
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
folks um to put the three positions over
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
to the doe but not provide the funding
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for those positions in essence
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
making the doe absorb the cost of the
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
three positions yeah they they would
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
have to I mean the you know you can you
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
can go about it but yes it would fold it
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
in um I don't believe you should be
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
taxing even though it's a small tax I
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe you should be taxing
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers for somebody
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
that they can't Advocate that they don't
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
get to change out so I'm gu the fiscal
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
note indicates there's a million doll
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue assessment
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
and more or less a million dollar
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
decrease in spending
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so the short answer is yes holds it
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
in they are going to absorb the cost of
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
the three okay you eliminating a tax
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
would be another way to look at it got
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
yes we have the Department of energy
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
here they will be at the last person to
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
testify so they can answer
 
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
questions excuse me any other
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much I
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
enjoy it I'll be uh if you need me I'll
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
be in that room working so thank you
 
00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:54.750 align:start position:0%
be in that room working so thank you
representative

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you madam chair and members
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee for for the record I am
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas and I
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
represent the town of marac uh there are
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
going to be several people behind me who
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
are going to talk about the actual
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
duties of the uh consumer Advocate I sit
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
on science technology and
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
energy and it is incumbent upon our
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
government to have someone on our side
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
our side being the rate payers who is
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
fair and impartial I don't necessarily
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
agree with everything the consumer
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
Advocate says but I certainly listen
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
because he knows how to push back he is
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
Corner um what I would like to bring
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
your attention to is on the first page
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note the second paragraph
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
starts with line one the consumer
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
Advocate is appointed by the governor
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
and the executive Council for a 4-year
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
term if the office is repealed the
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
incumbent would be entitled to payment
 
00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:54.919 align:start position:0%
of salary and benefits through the end
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
term this bill is one of the most
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
fiscally irresponsible things that you
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
can do good luck explaining to your
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
constituents that you are going to
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
eliminate a position of someone who has
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
and continues to have our rate payers
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
back pay that person for the next three
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
years representative Thomas the position
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
is not eliminated it is relocated if
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see on the bill on page three the
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate on line 7 is appointed
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
as part of the department and the and
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
there are the staff positions are
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
further down that paragraph the position
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
is being relocated rather than
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
eliminated is that not correct
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
I that was not my understanding my
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the position would
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
that no
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
right assuming the department of energy
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
appoints the
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
existing uh com consumer Advocate
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
assistant consumer Advocate and and
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
secretary those positions are
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
established in the department of energy
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
and will be funded by the department of
 
00:29:18.909 --> 00:29:18.919 align:start position:0%
energy it is not my understanding that
 
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
it is simply moving the position over it
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
is it is getting rid of the current
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and then rolling in a
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
new person I believe that's that's not
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
what the bill specifically says although
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's is a possibility from what the
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor said that's not his intent so if
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're concerned that the
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
individuals currently in the position
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
are doing a good job and ought to be
 
00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:48.789 align:start position:0%
are doing a good job and ought to be
retained

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's would not be violated by this
 
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.350 align:start position:0%
that's would not be violated by this
bill

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily that is not my understanding
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
but I I hear what you're saying
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
um how can so if this happened it would
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
be fiscally
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
irresponsible um um and again I just
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
attended the deliberative session in
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
marac last night and people are paying
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
attention to costs um I would
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
just caution if and I guess the the bill
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
needs more clarification um because that
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
is not my understanding of the bill um
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
but I will let the people behind me
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
speak um and and just to because it was
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
raised by the prime sponsor um and I'm
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
glad that the point was was brought up
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
um bringing the energy codes from 2018
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
to 21 the rates that the uh Prime
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor presented are greatly
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
exaggerated um and that's my bill we
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
have we we have that bill with a
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
separate issue yeah that's my bill and I
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
presented it here so um um and there
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
there was a question of why the OCA
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of that bill and that
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
is because the bill favors Energy
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
Efficiency for the rate payers and
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
that's his job thank you there's a
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
question representative Schmidt thank
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so I I agree that the
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
setup of the bill is confusing it says
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
repealing the consumer Advocate uh but
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor explained it that's not
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
his real intent but the the office of
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislative Services kind of dealt in a
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
short hand
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
um so in any case but his argument is it
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
would be better under the uh doe than
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
under the governor in terms of
 
00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
appointment uh and can you speak to the
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
idea of whether that actually in your
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
opinion might be the case that it would
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
be a better arrangement I I would
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
dispute that but I I'm interested in
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
your opinion I I will dispute it as well
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
because the uh Commissioners for the doe
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
are politically appointed so you're just
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
taking one political appointment and
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
appointment representative nearly
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
everyone in the go in the state
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
government is politically appointed
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
except for us poor suckers
 
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.549 align:start position:0%
except for us poor suckers
representative

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you for uh taking my
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
question um so do you believe that
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
energy producers have an incentive to
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
increase uh energy consumption in
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
households to increase yes no thank you
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
thank you other other questions thank
 
00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:34.039 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Thomas wait
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
a minute so you're saying I'm sorry do
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
you want you you called it Madam chair
 
00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799 align:start position:0%
do you want me to continue with that I I
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
you you answered I think that's okay
 
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
that's right okay we've got we've got a
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of people that want to speak
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
good morning Madame chair colleagues for
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
the record representative Michael
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
Bose I represent Rockingham District 5
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
the town of eeping I chair the science
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
technology and energy
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm here this morning to
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill as being neutral
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
I'm neutral on the bill but I thought it
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
might be interesting to talk about some
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
of the questions that seem pretty
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
obvious by the filing of this bill for
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
example we have a Public Utilities
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
Commission whose job it is to determine
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
if utility rates are just and reasonable
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
for all classes of
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
customers that would include residential
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
customers so it's an interesting
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
question to wonder well why do we need a
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
second check on utility rates in the
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
person of the consumer advocate's
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
office well one of the answers to that
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
one of the possible answers to that
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
question goes back about 25
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
years is it turns out
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
80% of the customers of electricity in
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
our state are residential
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
customers but they only buy 40% of the
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
the electricity that gets
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
used the other 20% of customers are
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
commercial so-called commercial and
 
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.109 align:start position:0%
commercial so-called commercial and
Industrial

00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
Industrial
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
users they buy 60% of the
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
electricity so you can see that there's
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
kind of an imbalance between those
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
classes and 25 years ago people thought
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
that maybe we needed more protection for
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers and so the
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
office of the well first the um
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers Advisory Board
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
was created and then eventually the
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
advocate so that's probably why we're in
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
the place we're at today where we have
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
rates I think res representative Barry
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
he went on for a long time so I'm not
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
sure if he covered this or not but there
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
are a couple of things that could
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh improve potentially the office of the
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate for example right now
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
St statutory requirement is that the
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate him or herself be an
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
attorney but I think that could be
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
changed and as long as there is an
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
attorney in that
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
office that would allow the office to do
 
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
the due diligence work it needs to do in
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
utility rate cases but if the consumer
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
Advocate himself was not an
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
attorney possibly an engineer could do
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
attorney and another thing to consider
 
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.349 align:start position:0%
attorney and another thing to consider
is

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that if there is a concern about whether
 
00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
or not the consumer Advocate is doing
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
the job that he's charged to do he or
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
she is charged to do by stat
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
it could always tighten those statutory
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
requirements and for example require
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
that the consumer Advocates office
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
only act upon
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
residential utility rate
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
cases and not other matters uh that
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
might come before various committees in
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
the house so that's all I wanted to say
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
this morning um I know you've got a lot
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
going on I'd be happy to take
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative are
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
there any
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions don't see any very thank you
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
Harrington good morning members I'm
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Harrington I
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
represent stord 18 the way of background
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in the um energy in
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission uh for
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years either as in my five
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
five terms uh and science technology and
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
energy and 10 years at the Pu some of
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
which I was a commissioner so just to
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
give you a little background I think
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
I've probably been involved dealing with
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
the office of OCA more than anybody in
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
this room with the I don't see really
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
any exception so I have a history with
 
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with this office U first off I
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
have to say that the sponsor of the bill
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
U I'll just say is confused he has a lot
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
of wrong facts statements like more
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
money when rates go up that is totally
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
false the utilities pass through rates
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
if the rate goes up 5% they pass that
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
through the rate goes down 5% they pass
 
00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
that through it doesn't affect their
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
profits one way or the other so
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
obviously he doesn't really understand
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
how utilities work he also talks about
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
the fun of the uh Office of the consumer
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
Advocate being a tax on the individ with
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
the rate payers well it's a fee that's
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
charged it's an assessment that's
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
charged to the utilities based on the
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
size of the utility and that's also done
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
to fund the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
so I mean the alternate with from that
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
would be rather than have the people
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
that are benefiting if you will from
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
having a pu and an Office of Consumer
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
Advocate pay for that it would have to
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
be simply a tax that everybody in the
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
state pays because you'd have to fund it
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
one way or the other unless you going to
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
get rid of it and have no Public
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission so and of course as
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
stated by the chairman every uh appointy
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
is political to bring that argument up
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be less political
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
when they get to the dees is is simply
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
silly so just enough of that let me go
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
on with the things about the bill a few
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
things there another major thing that
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
was incorrect in the previous statements
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
is what the function of the OCA is over
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
and over again it was stated the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
function is to lower rates for
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers that is not the
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
function of the office and I will read
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
it to you it don't go into a lot of
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
details it says in which the interest of
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers are
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
involved and to represent the interest
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
of util such residential utility
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
customers represent their interest not
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily just to lower rates their
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
interest could be for example making
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
sure there's reliable supply of
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
electricity because I think as everybody
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
knows people are willing to spend almost
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
anything during a power outage to get
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
their well to work and to turn on their
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
stove so it's more than just lowering
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
rates that's that's not the only
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
function of the OCA is to represent the
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
residential utility customer so why is
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
this important well again in my many
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
years of experience at the Pu and at the
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
science technology any commission we've
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
had numerous times when people come in
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
to give a opinion or promote a
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
particular position these are lobbyists
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
I mean the utilities have lobbyists
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
they're backed up by teams of engine
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
engineers and lawyers there's lobbyists
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
for all sorts of other organizations the
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
Bia the business industry Association
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
comes in their lobbyist the Timberline
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
associate the Timberland Association
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
Owners Association comes in and lobbies
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh the um yes we get the point okay so
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
there there's there's tons of them
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
environmental agencies and so forth but
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
nobody comes in specifically to lobby
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
for the residential rate payer other
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
than the OCA and that's why it's so
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
important that this position be kept
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
independent because if they rolled into
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the Department of energy then they're
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
going to be basically implementing the
 
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
policies of the Department of energy
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
which may not be singularly in the best
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
interest of the residential rate payer
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
it may be they may look at the big
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
picture and say well for the overall
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
State it's best we do this but all those
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
other lobbyists are going to be there
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
saying well no no no you need to change
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
it because it'll be better for my
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
organization or my group or my special
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
interest group but no one will be making
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
that argument for the uh residential
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
rate payer because they'll be told not
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
to because they're going to be
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
subordinates of the higher ups in the
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy so that is the um
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that is the main reason to keep
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
this independent and I I believe this is
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
a solution in search of a problem uh
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
I've been involved like I say with the
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
OCA for many years many different ocas
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
and I've agreed with some disagreed with
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
others but I think as chairman Vos just
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
said if you think there's an issue with
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
how they are are doing their Duty which
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
is again to represent the interest of
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
the retail rate payers not necessarily
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
neily to lower rates then we should
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
tighten up those requirements on that
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
and give more guidance to the OCA as to
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
what to do getting rid of the OCA it's
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
it's not only silly it's not only
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem it is
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
really just bad politics because it's
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
going to make us look like we're taking
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
this pain in the butt problem who speaks
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
up a lot and we're hiding them under the
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
department of uh energy where we can
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
tell them keep quiet you're not talking
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
about that issue and I just hopefully
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
this will found inappropriate to
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
legislate because it's certainly
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to legislate and I'll take
 
00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to legislate and I'll take
any

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair uh
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative since you've been around
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
the block a while here in OCA how many
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
people did they start with and has it
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
grown I think it's been about the same
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
overall and and while to get on that
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
question I should have mentioned also
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
that the this bill will start right if
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
it passes it's going to cost over $250
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
million that we just toss out the window
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
because the existing OCA as it says in
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note will continue to get
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
paid for the length of his term which
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
ends I think in November of 27 so he can
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
sit home and watch TV go get a job
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
someplace else do whatever he wants and
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
he's going to continue to get paid it's
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
going to cost a quarter of a million
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
doar they'll have to pay somebody else
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
to do that function over in the
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
department of energy maybe it'll be less
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
money but you're still losing $250,000
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Harrington that
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're assuming the
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy will not under any
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
circum cumstances appoint the current
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate to the position
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
created in the bill I will let correct I
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
will let the consumer Advocate speak for
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
himself but I highly doubt he would take
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
a position at lower pay to give up
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
higher pay for not working that I mean
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
he's pretty logical I would don't think
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
he's going to take I don't think anyone
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
would do
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you that's a valuable
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
information representative sellers yeah
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so wouldn't an option be
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
just we could amend this bill here to
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
start at the date this person ends that
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
will resolve that problem it could be it
 
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
would be off in November of 2027 but but
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
it still doesn't change the my main
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
problem that's kind of a minor thing
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
that that the main issue I have with
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is it takes away the
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
independence of the consumer Advocate
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
who's going to be who's out there
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
fighting against all the other
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
independent people who represent the
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
various special interest groups the
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate has a special interest
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
group it's the retail residential rate
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
payers nobody specifically represents
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
them other than the uh consumer Advocate
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
the dees represents the entire State the
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
Pu represents the entire
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
State thank you represent
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
sles thank you madam chair um I I have a
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
question in terms of accountability uh
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony seems to indicate that
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
you find the current structure uh
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
delivers some measure of accountability
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could express how that
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism functions um in your mind and
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh how moving to the Department of
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
energy would somehow weaken that
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
accountability sure well as it was
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
stated by the chairman every office is a
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
political pointy so it doesn't really
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
make any difference the accountability I
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
guess comes with at the end of their
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
term the governor whoever is Governor at
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
that time may or may not uh an executive
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
counsel may or may not appoint them or
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
reappoint them that's that's where the
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
accountability comes from just like in
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
the department of energy the the person
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
there might be doing what they think is
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
a great job and then uh there's an
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
election the governor changes and they
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
say no you're not going to get
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
reappointed because we don't like what
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
you've been doing so I mean it's it's no
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
different than any other office as far
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
as accountability goes uh you get
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
appointed for a specific term and at the
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
end of the term whoever is making the
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
decision whether to reappoint you will
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
decide whether that's a good idea or not
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee good to see you all this
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
morning um I'm here today uh opposed to
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
the passage of hb610 and I hope you will
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately find it inexpedient to
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'll give you a little
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
idea why
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
um it's I think it's difficult for uh
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
folks who have not had a lot of
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
experience with the Public Utilities
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
Commission uh and the office of the
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate to understand where to
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
sort of slot the interactions of those
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and how they operate uh there
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
was a a pipeline project proposed
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire in 2014 and that
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
was the first time I went up to the
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to kind of
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
observe their functioning um and learn a
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
bit about how that operated here in the
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I also uh
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
followed a bill over to the Public
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and was an
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
intervener so I got kind of an Insider
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
look as well at providing information to
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
them um on a docket and so I have a
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
little bit of familiarity with both of
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
those things and I have actually known
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
the current consumer Advocate since
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
2019 and I'm here to say that I think
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill is the result of the fact
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
that he is a very good consumer
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
Advocate um and uh what that means is
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
that his role is unlike any other role
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
that is played uh in the dockets that
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
that the office of the consumer advocate
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
participates in and he understands the
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
context of that role because he's
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
qualified for the job by his legal
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
training he understands the statutory
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
mandates he understands the interactions
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the parties um to the dockets and he
 
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
does an exemplary job of maintaining the
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
interests of the rate payers in those
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
dockets and I have seen that firsthand
 
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to bring that perspective
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
here because it's something you wouldn't
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
have if you never observed how these
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
processes uh go
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
on and I'm sorry excuse my voice I'm
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a cold um and I
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
guess another piece of information that
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
I can bring um that might be um more
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
information for the committee is that
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's been a little bit of a um Turf
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
War uh going on with the Public
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and and the office
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
of the consumer Advocate and others um
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with political
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
appointments and how people view their
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
jobs and that kind of thing too that's
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
all sort of Insider baseball over there
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
but it has been in the press as well and
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
so um I view this bill as um targeted
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to remove that ability for
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
the existing consumer Advocate who I
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
believe has been been reappointed twice
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
under Governor sununu's terms um from
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
remaining in that job because he is
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
shining a light on the problems that are
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
happening at the Public Utilities
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
Commission and I think that that's a
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
very valuable thing I think my colleague
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
um representative Harrington kind of
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
alluded to that beforehand and he has
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
firsthand experience in working over at
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission there's
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
a role to be played here and it needs to
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
be independent it um we've already seen
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
other functions rolled into the
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy since it was
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
reconstituted as part of the Budget
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
Trailer bill in 2021 when it was
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
recreated it used to be the office of
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
energy planning um so there's jockeying
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
for position there's changes in control
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
but I think the question comes down to
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
um what does this bill actually do the I
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
guess the prime sponsor indicated that
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily affect this
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
particular consumer Advocate but line
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
one says purpose effective after 120
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
days of the X Passage the office of the
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate as created by RSA 363
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
colon 28 shall be
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
dissolved okay so it it will be
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
reconstituted according to them behind
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
closed doors and not as visible to the
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
public but it will not be the same
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
independent agency that we have today
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
and um so the bill does dissolve the
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
office as it is constituted today which
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
is why prior speakers were trying to
 
00:50:28.109 --> 00:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
explain that statutorily since he is a
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
lawyer he knows that he is he will be
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
paid through the end of his term whether
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
or not he is serving and so what will
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
what will basically be happening is the
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or whoever is funding the job
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
that job and whatever um is
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
reconstituted within the department of
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
energy they will be Sim simultaneously
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
being paid for the same work rather than
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
um as again represent representative
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington alluded to
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh this Pro you know uh solution in
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
search of a problem uh was brought up to
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature so the bill does
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
dissolve the
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
role um and that is the first thing that
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
is the primary purpose of the bill
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
according to the bill um so I just
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
wanted you to be clear about that and I
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
um I think uh what we should be asking
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves is whether or not this
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate is
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
qualified whether this consumer Advocate
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
is doing the job that he um is El is
 
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
hired to
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
do and whether whether he actually uh
 
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.230 align:start position:0%
do and whether whether he actually uh
has

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
been um standing up in the face of
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
significant uh push back from utilities
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders that he is
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
regularly collaborating with in order to
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
come to solutions for the State of New
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I have seen him do that I
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
have been in rooms uh where he has been
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
working to do that i w i served with
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose for four years on the
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
board which he was a member of for I
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that the board
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
was the board um was in service for
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
about 15 years and for a significant
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
portion of that he was on that board as
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
well so he plays a very unique role and
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
he is being targeted and that is that is
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
my perspective on on the bill so if um
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I I will attempt
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
to answer them thank you are there any
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
scitech representative McGee you're
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
talking about this particular individual
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the Office of
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
Consumer Advocate would your testimony
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
be the same if you didn't have this high
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
regard for the current incumbent that's
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
a good question and a legitimate
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
question um I think it would but it it's
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
it's better for someone to actually know
 
00:52:57.309 --> 00:52:57.319 align:start position:0%
how the person operat in the job in
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
order to speak to what the bill would do
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
right the bill would eliminate this
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
person who's good at their job from
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
doing that job um and from being able to
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
point out uh flaws that are detrimental
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
to the process uh the processes that
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
he's involved with right he's
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
Illuminating things for us that we
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't otherwise know about and I
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe that's why this bill has
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
happened and I thought that those
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
insights should be brought here because
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
often times we have hearings where we're
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
talking at a surface level about what's
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
going on on here if it didn't say
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
dissolve the office if it said we're
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
going to roll it in then that would be
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
more of a redistribution of how things
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
are functioning but that um I don't
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
think is the purpose of the bill and
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's and it's written in the bill so yes
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
I do have a high regard um and my
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge of how this is operating and
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
where the bill what the Bill's
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
motivation is is something I could lend
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
to the hearing please don't impune their
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
motivation you can't know what really
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
motivates people that's that's
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
true the fact that that's what the bill
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
says is is fair gain okay thank you
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
represent that you have a followup can't
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
wait to meet him yeah yeah I hope you're
 
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
as impressed we have fewer questions
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
we'll get to him sooner representative
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
reze thank you madam chairwoman thank
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
you representative MC um quick question
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
for you uh the how would the um OCA be
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
compromised and their effectiveness
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
compromized in your mind by moving it
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
doe given
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps political debates that are no
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is in my opinion um the the board
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned the easy board I have
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
some familiarity with um a stakeholder
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
Group which included the utilities but
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
it also included weatherization folks
 
00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
housing folks you know interested
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
parties that were trying to help the
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire deal with
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
questions around Energy Efficiency and
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy so they would do sort
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
of research and um information gathering
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
in order to provide information to
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
decisions cases bills that kind of thing
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
and we do a lot of I I consider that the
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way the the stakeholder
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
groups um there was a bill last year to
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
um take the role that the Energy
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and sustainable energy board
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
have been playing for 15 years and roll
 
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
it into the department of
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
energy and one of the things that was
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
good about that stakeholder group was it
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
was public it was transparent the public
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
was able to listen into those
 
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.710 align:start position:0%
was able to listen into those
conversations

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
um we don't have that view anymore um
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
and there isn't as public
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
um I have no idea what's been
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
happening in terms of uh those functions
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
so I think um it's been alluded to by
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
prior speakers that it's basically the
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
independence of the office that we're
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
trying to keep separate from Rolling it
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
into a division who would then make more
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
of the decisions and also hire somebody
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
who maybe wouldn't be
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh as willing to speak truth to power
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
because it can sometime times be um
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
embarrassing to have somebody call you
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
out but um I think the purpose of the
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate is to have the
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
latitude to be able to call out uh when
 
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.630 align:start position:0%
latitude to be able to call out uh when
something

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
about um Utilities Commission activities
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
is not uh operating as it should thank
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
you yep and he's in a unique position to
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
do it other
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you um I'd
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
like to take this this moment to tell
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
the people who are here for cac1 that
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
we're running significantly
 
00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:36.870 align:start position:0%
we're running significantly
late

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that we will have to
 
00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:41.559 align:start position:0%
postpone you to later today I'm sorry
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
about this but I've still got a stack of
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
cards on House Bill 610 that we need to
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
deal with so
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
if would it be agreeable to you to to
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
cac1 3 3 p.m. 3
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
p.m. yes okay thank you very much I'm
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
sorry about it but um I didn't believe
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 610 would be quite as

department of energy the Public
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and the office of
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate frequently you're
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to hear me say something that I
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
rarely get to say I agree with
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
everything that representative
 
00:58:19.599 --> 00:58:22.750 align:start position:0%
everything that representative
Harrington

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
the Pu hearings uh have the department
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
of energy and the office of the consumer
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
Advocate often as parties to the
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
hearings and I can tell you from what
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
I've heard in our committee over the
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
last two plus years that the consumer
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
Advocate does not always align with the
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
views of the Department of energy does
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
not always align with the views of the
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
does not always align with the views of
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
the utilities does not always align with
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
the views of the Republicans on stn and
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
does not always align with the views of
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
the Democrats on
 
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
st&amp; the OCA is
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
independent and we need to keep the OCA
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
independent the OCA literally speaks
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
truth to power and of course I mean by
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
power utilities that kind of power but
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
the other kind of power as
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
well if the OCA moves into the doe that
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
removes the independence the OCA as I
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
said doesn't always agree with the doe
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
if the OCA moves into the doe You've
 
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
Lost That independent voice that we need
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
at the puc hearings so please don't do
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
this the other thing to think about in
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
terms of uh it being a political
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
appointment the current form of the OCA
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
is that it's for a four-year term
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
but if the OCA is moved into a position
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy it's not a
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
four-year term appointment that can just
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
uh that that is independent in other
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
words if the OCA doesn't agree with the
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the doe couldn't the doe
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner replace the OCA so we need
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
to keep that position
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
independent the final thing I want to
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
if you remove the OCA as an independent
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
position when you are running for
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
reelection there are going to be
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
opponents who point out to your
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
constituents that you have voted to
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
remove the one independent voice who's
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking out for their interests as rate
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
payers now you can try explaining no but
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
we just moved it on into the department
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
of energy and at that point your your
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
constituents are just not hearing it
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to hear the one thing you
 
01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
voted to remove the independent voice
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
that is looking out for their interests
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
so just think about that and with that
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh good morning chair uh chair Maguire
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh honorable members of the committee
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
especially representative scitec who
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
said he was excited to meet me I am uh
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
attorney Donald cree and for the past
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
nine years and 20 days I've had the
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
honor of serving as our state's consumer
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
Advocate responsible for advancing the
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
interests of New Hampshire's residential
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
utility customers wherever those
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
interests arise the office of the
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate usually referred to as
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
the OCA takes no position on House Bill
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
610 I think it would be presumptuous of
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
me to attempt to tell the state's
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
elected officials whether after nearly
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
50 years our office should continue to
 
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
exist as an independent organization
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
whether it should be folded into another
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
agency or whether it should be abolished
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
altogether but I want you to make a
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
fully informed good decision and that is
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
what uh prompts my testimony today to
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that you have a full and fair
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we do and why we
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
do it now using membership in the
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
National Association of State utility
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocates as a yard stick we
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
are one of 43 offices around the country
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
that work at the state level to
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
represent rate payer interests the main
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
stay of the work is participating as an
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
active party in proceedings before State
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
utility Regulators in our case the New
 
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
the pu's enabling statute and I think
 
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
this is really important requires that
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
agency to serve as the Arbiter between
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
the interests of utility
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
shareholders investors who reasonably
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
enough seek to extract as much profit as
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
they can and utility customers who want
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
and need safe and reliable service at
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
the lowest possible cost with as much
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
Freedom as they can get to control how
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
when and why they use their utility
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
service utilities are well represented
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
extremely well represented in pu
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings it's not unusual for a big
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
utility like eversource to show up at a
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
pu hearing with 15 or 20 people lawyers
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts outside
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
Consultants we help the Pu do its
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
Arbiter job by throwing at least a
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of weight on the other side
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
scale the OCA came into existence in
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
1976 originally as the legislative
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
utility consumer Council and at various
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
times we have been an adjunct of the
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
general court an office within the Pu
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
and since
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
1985 we have been a completely
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
independent instrumentality of state
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
government if you take one point away
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
with you from my testimony this morning
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
and here I have to say that I
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
representative Barry let it be this the
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
independence of the office of the
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate is our superpower the
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
energy related policy agendas of the two
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
major political parties EB and flow
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
Democrats love to extract special favors
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the solar industry or big wind
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
Republicans are keen on building nuclear
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
reactors representative Barry mentioned
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
that and so-called dispatchable
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
generation policy makers from both
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
parties have wanted to rebuild the
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
economy of the North country by burning
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
wood to make electricity now I am not
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
here to criticize any of that my job
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
however is to point out that however
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
virtuous those policy imperatives are
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
they cost rate payers money often too
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
much money and for the past nine years I
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
and my staff have made those arguments
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
at the Pu here at the state house and at
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
the regional and federal levels as well
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
a fact in which I take enormous pride is
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
that I was originally appointed by
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassen I have twice been
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
reappointed by Governor cunu neither
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
Governor has either of those two
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
Governors has ever attempted to insert
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
themselves or otherwise influence our
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
work I know that both Governor Hassen
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
and Governor sonunu did not always agree
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
with me but I take their
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
non-interference as a sign of confidence
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
and respect for what we contribute to
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
the process of utility regulation in the
 
01:05:56.349 --> 01:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
state and region now I I I'm sorry that
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Barry and and and I want
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
to say he was kind enough to meet with
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
me and talk about this bill for an hour
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago and I really respect his
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
willingness to do that and I'm sorry
 
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
that I was not able to convince him that
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
our independence as it is currently
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
constituted uh makes a difference my
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
lived experience in nine years and 20
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
days says otherwise no interference with
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
what we do he criticized my support of
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves programs they
 
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.109 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves programs they
are

01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
payer funded uh programs they save
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
consumers money they survive a rigorous
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
benefit cost test we assured we argued
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
for that rigorous benefit cost tests
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
that's the reason I can confidently come
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
here today and tell you that those
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
programs are good for the residential
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
rid payers that we
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
represent the question of energy codes
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
came up that's the same issue right if
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
you take the energy code and you update
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
it from the 2018 version to the 2021
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
version in the long run over the
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
lifetime of your ownership of a home
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
built according to the energy code you
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
will save money now I know that's a
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
contentious proposition I know there are
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
arguments back and forth but that's the
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
reason that I support uh moving forward
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
with an advanced version of the state
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
energy codes uh representative Barry
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
suggested or implied that I am an
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
opponent of new natural gas pipelines
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
their other new energy a facilities
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
during my 9 years and 20 days the OCA
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
has never not once opposed a natural gas
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
pipeline or the development of any new
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
energy facilities that have been
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
proposed in this state
 
01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
so uh and I I just want to say I I
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
listened to his testimony very carefully
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
and he began by saying that he decided
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
to draft his bill so that it folds my
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
office into the department of energy
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
because he said we lack the uh political
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
will to just abolish my office outright
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
well I I think that undermines his
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
argument again again with
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
respect here's a couple of other things
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
I think you should keep in mind a as the
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
newest cabinet level agency one that is
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
still finding its wings by the way the
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy was created three
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
and a half years ago to throw some heft
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
behind the governor's policy agenda when
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
it comes to energy but as everyone in
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
this room knows when deciding what to do
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
about energy and utilities a governor
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
must consider a pile of competing policy
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
imperatives what's good for utilities
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
what's good for economic development
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
what's good for the environment what's
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
good for addressing the housing shortage
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
you name it however those competing
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
imperatives get worked out they do not
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
equate with what's good for the rate
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
payers so governor aot won election in
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
part by urging us not to become
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and look I've tried to
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
navigate staro drive so I relate but in
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
this instance the question is really
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
whether New Hampshire wants to become
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
Vermont because Vermont does rate payer
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
advocacy exactly the way House Bill 610
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
proposes that we do it Vermont has a
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Service the
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
functional equivalent of our department
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
of energy the Department of Public
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
Service claims to represent rate payer
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
interests for the Vermont pu but here's
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
how they do it they simply assume that
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
whatever their governor likes is what
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
benefits rate payers and I speak here
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
from experience as someone who and
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
please forgive me spent a brief part of
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
his career as a hearing officer at the
 
01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.189 align:start position:0%
his career as a hearing officer at the
Vermont

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
pu a related Point unlike New Hampshire
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont is simply absent at Nee poool
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the super powerful stakeholder body that
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
deliberates on Market rules and other
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
matters related to ISO New England The
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
troublingly unaccountable Entity that
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
runs the regional electricity grid and I
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
have been speaking out about that lack
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
of accountability and I suspect although
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
you should ask them that that is the
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
reason that the folks at the no coal no
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
gas movement have said nice things about
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
me even though I have never supported
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
their aggressive climate agenda that
 
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
calls for shutting down all the fossil
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
generation in our region
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
unlike either the Vermont Department of
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
Public Service or the New Hampshire
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy we the OCA have the
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
right to serve as a voting member of
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
neol and rest assured we participate
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
actively and vigilantly because neol and
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
ISO New England are important for the
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
same reason that Willie Sutton robbed
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
banks because that is where the money is
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
here's a concrete example so-called
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
asset condition transmission projects of
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
which there are approximately $5 billion
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
dollar worth somewhere in the planning
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
and construction pipeline around the
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
region these are rebuild and expand
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
projects and here's the problem with
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
them no regulatory scrutiny I and my
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
counterparts around New England are
 
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
really concerned that at least some of
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
this spending is unnecessary and
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
imprudent right now the poster child for
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
unscrutinized asset condition projects
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
is ever source's plan to spend more than
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
$400 million rebuilding its x178
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
transmission line right here in Western
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are sounding the alarm
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
about this and I will continue to do
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
that as long as we are able now rather
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
than take up this whole hearing which is
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
already in overtime uh for for myself
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
I've prepared a handout for you that
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
covers the basics of the OCA our work
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
and some of our accomplishments I have
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
been advised to come in here and try to
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
convince you that we routinely save raid
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
paays money in an amount that well
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
exceeds our annual budget of about 1.1
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
million do and we do indeed from time to
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
time get to make that happen but here's
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
the thing we're really
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperators way more often than not
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
advancing rate payer interests requires
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
finding common ground with others with
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
utilities with other agencies with
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
interest groups and then convincing the
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
Pu that the consensus that we have built
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
is what the public interest requires now
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
I've noticed that no is a very popular
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
word among my national counterparts but
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
I would rather the OCA were remembered
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
for what we built up new technologies
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
new and better infrastructure new
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
freedoms that save people money rather
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
than have the OCA on my watch be
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
remembered for what we tore down or what
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
we stopped now Begg your Indulgence I'd
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
like to end on a personal note at around
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
the time that New Hampshire was creating
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
the legislative utility consumers
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
Council back in the mid 1970s I was a
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
teenager living in Suburban New York and
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
my teenage rebellion I'm sure all of you
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
had one my teenage rebellion took an
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
unusual form classical music especially
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
Mozart so one day I read in the paper
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the only all classical music radio
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
station in New York w n Cen would be
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
switching at midnight to rock and roll
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
but when I tuned in at midnight the
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
announcer gleefully proclaimed that it
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't happening because a feisty
 
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
citizens group The wncn listeners Guild
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
had obtained an injunction classical
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
music on
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
wncn though briefly interrupted lasted
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
for another 19 years well my musical
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
tastes have broadened since then
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
nowadays I'm just as likely to be
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
listening to Billy eish or bad bunny as
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
am to a Mozart Opera but the victory
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
that I found out about that night in
 
01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
1974 became and Remains the animating
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
force of my career it's not about big
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
government and it's about talking back
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
to big government and to Big Business by
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
using people power since 1999 energy and
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
utilities have been the my focus and
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
since 2016 I'm proud of what I've been
 
01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
able to do in marshalling people power
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
to advance the cause of utility rate
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
payers really gratified to hear the
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
leading lights from the house Science
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
Tech and energy committee from both
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:37.880 align:start position:0%

consumer Advocate I'm really grateful
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
and I agree with everything they've said
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
there is so much more that we can do and
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
I hope to continue to have the
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help do it thank you for
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
considering my testimony thanks in
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
courtesies that you've extended of
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%

01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
questions that you might be willing to
 
01:14:59.550 --> 01:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
entertain thank you representative
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
scitec Mr Cree did you mean
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
wqxr representative thank you for that
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
clarification so wqxr back then was the
 
01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
radio station of the New York Times it
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't all classical it was sort of
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
classical um I have a question in your
 
01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.709 align:start position:0%
classical um I have a question in your
current

01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
position who's establishes your budget
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
and and sets how many people you can
 
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.189 align:start position:0%
and and sets how many people you can
hire

01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
hire
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
we're currently authorized to have six
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
people working for us one of our
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
positions is vacant we grew from five to
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
six a couple of years ago to do Regional
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
and federal work and our budget is part
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the state budget so I have to go
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
before the finance committees first I
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
have to get the governor to agree so
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's the same process that every
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
other state agency so you are a separate
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
agent and you have a separate line in
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
house bill one or one yes thank you
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I needed to know any
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
other representative
 
01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
SL thank you madam chair um I had a
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
question I I'm I'm curious the the the
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
bill before us moves your office from an
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
independent agency into another agency
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the arguments that I'm hearing made
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
are ones of accountability and so um I'm
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
trying to to sort out why the current
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
configuration makes you more accountable
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
to the people in general um
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
and what what I'm curious about is when
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
there is a contentious issue that comes
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
before your office um what is your
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
policy your overall view on taking one
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
position versus the other or maybe not
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
taking a position at all and when taking
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
a position how does that represent all
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
rate payers thank you thank you that's
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
an excellent question and uh it uh it
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
means that I get to tell you about
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't been mentioned so
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
far in today's hearing and that has to
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
do with the residential rate payers
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
Advisory board so The Advisory Board
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
acts as a buffer between me and the
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
vicissitudes of the politics of
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
appointed service in state government
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
and it meets quarterly and it
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
deliberates on the very questions that
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and particularly
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
over the last uh couple of years since
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
the speaker appointed the venerable Neil
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
Kirk who is here in the room to our
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
Advisory board he has insisted that our
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board uh have a lively
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of the very issues that you
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
are suggesting that we should be
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
focusing on so it's not about just
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
assuming that whatever and my team
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
subjectively think is good for raid
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
payers is going to be our position we
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
those things are vetted at our Advisory
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
Board and The Advisory Board itself is
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
nine people three appointed by the
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
governor three appointed by the speaker
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
three appointed by the Senate President
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you for giving me the
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make sure you knew about
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to mention that that The
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
Honorable Neil Kirk is up next so very
 
01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
fair if you have a a direct and just
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
like representative scitech wanted to
 
01:17:56.350 --> 01:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
meet me I can't wait to hear what
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk says yes very fair
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
you have a followup please very narrow
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
sort of scope to my question is how
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
would the transition in your view from
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
an independent agency to the Department
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
of energy affect everything you just
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
described well instead of uh answering
 
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
to an Advisory Board uh I would report
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
to the or the consumer Advocate would
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
report to the commissioner of energy and
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
again and I'm not here to criticize the
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of energy at all he's an
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
excellent Public Service servant but you
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
know he has his conception of what the
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
right energy policy for the state is and
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's bigger than just what's good for
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
the rate payers and I would have to just
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
like my counterpart in Vermont does I
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
would have to conform what I do to his
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
or her
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
agenda okay thank you president um thank
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh thank you my
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
question is um regarding the New
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves um program as somebody
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
who can afford to make the choices to
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
save energy as much as I can and who can
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
rebate shop I know I've definitely
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
benefited from it but I'm curious how
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
much you focus the New Hampshire safe
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
project uh program to make sure that
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
those marginal consumers the lower
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
income ones who are barely paying their
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
electric electricity bill aren't paying
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
for my larest and other people like me
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
well the first thing I want to say is
 
01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
that the NH saves programs are required
 
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
to spend at least 20% of their budget on
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
helping lowincome customers so there are
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
programs specially targeted to people
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
who are particularly overly burdened by
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
their energy and I think your question
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
was how do I make sure that there isn't
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
a subsidy happening a sort of reverse
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
Robin hoodis I think that's the gist of
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
your question that's a legitimate
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
question and we keep an eye on that and
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
that is a a a function of going line by
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
line through the New Hampshire saves
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
program offerings and making sure that
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
they save everybody money uh but you do
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
raise a legitimate question that is the
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
subject of pretty intense discussion
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
when the trienal Energy Efficiency plan
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
is under
 
01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:00.639 align:start position:0%
review all right thank
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Kirk with
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
introduction good morning Madam
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and members of the committee
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Neil Kirk I live in
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
wear and I'm a member of the um
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers Advisory Board
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
and was appointed by uh twice by uh
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard to that position and I
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
am speaking today on necessarily on
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board but in favor of the
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
board's position which is it voted to
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um and the reason why
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here is because this bill will harm
 
01:20:46.990 --> 01:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
the elderly taxpayers that I represent
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether I should be pleased
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh name of venerable um I
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
remember the venerable a bead as a
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
book from high school and um he was an
 
01:20:59.239 --> 01:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
book from high school and um he was an
old

01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:07.550 align:start position:0%
old
guy

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
um um as you've heard this bill changes
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
the uh OCA from an independent status to
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
an arm or unit in
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
doe and there are consequences to this
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
that I think you've heard some of but
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make them in a perhaps a
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
more pointed fashion first this bill
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
isn't about smaller government or saving
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
money the bill requires the
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
relocated um OCA to do the same job in
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
the future that it does today the
 
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
problem is that instead of having five
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
or six employees the bill provides for
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
only three one of whom is a secretary
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that if the job
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
is to be done the same way and the bill
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
requires the job to be done the same way
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh more money is going to have to be
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
spent either with permanent employees or
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
hiring outside experts to give the ca
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
the new consumer Advocate uh the data
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
that he needs the information that he
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
needs to make decisions and carry out
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
his functions so there's not going to be
 
01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
any savings Financial Savings in this
 
01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
bill and as been pointed out uh this all
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
of these expenses including many of the
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
expenses of doe are paid for by rate
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
payers and the we as utility users
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
electricity water whatever it is pay our
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
share of these it's a small amount it's
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
not really relevant as a practical
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
matter if the doe decides not to fill
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
those five positions or provide the
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
necessary expert opinion then it will
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
have uh emasculated the de the new ca
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
and he will not be able to do his job as
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
requires um hopefully that will not
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
happen the consequences of not having an
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
independent um CA are as follows
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
right now when um we decide our rate
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
cases there are roughly five groups that
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
appear before the
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
Pu um there's the doe who represents the
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
state's interests whatever they may be
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
the transmission distributions companies
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
such as eversource with its 15 folks as
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh this as Mr Cree said um businesses as
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
consumers of electricity electricity
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
suppliers such as Direct Energy and all
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
those list Ed on the Pu website and
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
consumers through the OCA this bill
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
takes the OCA out of that reducing the
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
list to four requiring doe to
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
compromise what it does it's got to
 
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
balance the state's interest as Mr cre
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
said and the oca's interest to come up
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
with a single policy the Pu has denied
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
the voice of an independent
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
CA and that is not in the interests of
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers the consumer's
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
voice in effect is muted it's more
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
likely that our already high Electric
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
Residential electric rates will be even
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
higher than the otherwise would be if
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
you believe your constituents
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
electricity rates are already too high
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
this bill should be
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
killed thank you madam chairman I'd be
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
pleased to answer any questions if there
 
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
are any all right thank you are there
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
any represent
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
SL thank you um one of the previous
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned something in regards
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
to uh rates being set through pass
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
through or that somehow I interpreted
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
that as and please feel free to correct
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong that rates are somewhat
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
fixed or the that the percentages are
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat fixed so if the percentages are
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
fixed how does this office impact rate
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
payers uh and in the rates they pay uh
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
through their electricity
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
bills thank you for the question um
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
rates are not fixed they are set
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
periodically by the Pu see usually
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
because a utility says our costs are
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
higher we need to pass them on to rate
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
payers or we've uh invested more and
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're entitled to a higher return on
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
that investment which rate payers have
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
to pay so the Pu is constantly having
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
rate cases and they take as much as a
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
year to
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
decide after which these new rates
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes lower but almost always higher
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
are then translated into the rate that
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
you and I pay and we see on our electric
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
bill and remember we're only talking
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
here about
 
01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
electricity rates the the rate you
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
actually pay for the power is not
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
regulated by the
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
Pu it's your choice we have a free
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
market in that there's the community
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
power agency that has many towns
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
offering taking it to Services I
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes use Direct Energy right now
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
I'm on using the default rate ever
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
Source because it's lower than anything
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
else why is another question it may be
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
problematic um but remember that this
 
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
case and the OCA is really only talking
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
about the distribution transmission
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
rates not the quote power rates the
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
electricity itself
 
01:26:12.159 --> 01:26:14.830 align:start position:0%
electricity itself
rate

01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:18.510 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
else

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
followup yeah if if the Pu is
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
determining rates how does the office of
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
OCA lower costs
 
01:26:25.199 --> 01:26:27.109 align:start position:0%
OCA lower costs
it

01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
might thank you for that followup um
 
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
ever as an example eversource comes in
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
and says we want to spend $478 million
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever the number Mr Cree mentioned
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
is on um upgrading our um lines putting
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
in new power new polls and so forth um
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
even if they're not necessary this is
 
01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
very good because it's a very high rate
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
of return mandated I think by the
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
federal government FK Federal Energy
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission
 
01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.550 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission
of

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
99.65% that they can get on those kinds
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
of Investments so one of the things that
 
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
the OCA would do would be to come in and
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
say this investment is unnecessary these
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
polls still have another 20 years of
 
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
useful life why are you trying to
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
replace them now if they're successful
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
in that argument and this Capital
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
Improvement does not go forward or
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't go forward to the full extent it
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise would then rate payers are
 
01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:25.030 align:start position:0%
otherwise would then rate payers are
saved

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
saved
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
The Profit as well as the cost through
 
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
depreciation that they otherwise would
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
have to pay for these rates so the OCA
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
goes in makes the arguments if the Pu
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
buys them we avoid a rate
 
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639 align:start position:0%
increase I hope that answers the
 
01:27:42.350 --> 01:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
question follow up this would be rate
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
increase through their transmission cost
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
right got it thank you the transmission
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
distribution cost this probably be
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
transmission not distribution but would
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
be a component of their cost has nothing
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%

that I represented clients before the

New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
Commission I had the opportunity since
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
1980 to work with and observe every New
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumer
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
Advocate and learned a lot from them by
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
the way um I had three points that I
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
would like to make uh to
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
today um my written testimony goes into
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
more detail on these and other points
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
the three points that I would like to
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
make is that as I read House
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 610
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
FN it appears to me that the
 
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
OCA within a period of time will be
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
dissolved and the it will no longer be
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
agency and
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
36328 the legislature made clear that
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
the OCA was created as an independent
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%

G10
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
defines what
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
an an administratively attached agency
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
which the OCA is can do
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
and it made clear that the
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agency is to
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
make its own decisions on what issues it
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
raises before the Forum that it
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
appears and that is something that will
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
no longer happen in my opinion as I read
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
610 because the OCA
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
positions that get moved over there
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's three or five or
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
six they will
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
become either staff or employees of the
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
doe the department of
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
energy by
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
of energy statute makes clear that the
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of the Department
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
of energy sets policy for all of the
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
agency and that the
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner oversees the work of both
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the department heads and the staff of

the department heads and the staff of

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
agency assuming that the OCA position
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
becomes a staff position in the
 
01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
doe if the OCA had a position that
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
differed from that of the established
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
policy of the commissioner of
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
doe it
 
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
doe it
seems

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:34:10.669 --> 01:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
unlikely that the doe commissioner would
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
OCA to present that position at the
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that everyone's acting in good
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
faith with best intent but reasonable
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
Minds do differ on different points and
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason the commissioner's
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
policy and positions that the
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner establishes for the
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Department uh may may not coincide with
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
OCA would like its position to be so
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
is an OCA who is not really permitted to
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
continue to represent residential rate
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
payers as the
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
OCA position would like
 
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
to up until that's my first point my
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
second point is that up until
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
now in my observation the OCA
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
has done a very good and effective job
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
over at the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of residential rate payers
 
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
this is my opinion now but I think that
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
in large part that's due to the fact
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
that the OCA up until now has been an
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
independent and allowed to express and
 
01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:51.189 align:start position:0%
independent and allowed to express and
raise

01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
raise
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
positions and take positions and
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
present legal arguments on behalf of
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers that may not
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
always align with the other
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
parties um positions including the doe
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
and the Pu
 
01:36:15.390 --> 01:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
point I think
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
consideration needs to be given to what
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
the consequences might be of moving the
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
OCA without its independence over to the
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
doe what might the consequences be to
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission itself
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
this may sound presumptuous but to
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
consequences prior
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
speaker mentioned that there is a
 
01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:55.350 align:start position:0%
speaker mentioned that there is a
statute

01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
statute
RSA

01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
the one thing that I think everyone
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
would agree on I think would be that
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
whoever is the judge whoever is the
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
Arbiter whoever are the decision makers
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
they need to be well
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
informed and the only way they can be
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
well informed
 
01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.669 align:start position:0%
well informed
is

01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
a information from their staff and B
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
information provided by the party ities
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
to a particular proceeding before the
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
commission if one of the parties who
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
regularly participates in commission
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
proceedings is not allowed to
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
express his or her views
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
as an OCA doe staff member then the
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
result will be that the commission will
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
not know know what concerns the consumer
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
the doe consumer Advocate really
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
has and will not know if the
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
OCA has a
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
position contrary to or not in alignment
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
with the doe position well the result in
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
my mind will be that the commission will
 
01:38:50.239 --> 01:38:51.550 align:start position:0%
my mind will be that the commission will
never

01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
know and the one thing that's important
 
01:38:59.950 --> 01:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
is when you have a number of diverse
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
parties it's essential to be able to
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
parse through their positions and legal
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
arguments if the if the consumer
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
Advocate is no longer allowed to put
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
forth his or her position on behalf of
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
residential Rays then we end up in my
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
opinion with an Arbiter decision maker
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
who doesn't have the information it's
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
been withheld from him I think
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
unintentionally withheld
 
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
from the decision maker by House Bill
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
610 but
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless it's it's a restriction
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
that has been placed on the
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are not allowed to have
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
all the information it's very difficult
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
to make a decision when you have all the
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
information all the facts and all law in
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
front of you but it it
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
undermines the role of arbiter I think
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
that the commission is assigned and the
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
commission whether we agree or not agree
 
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
with everything that it
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
decides it's
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
nevertheless trying to do its best with
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
what it has and House Bill 610 in my
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
view ties one hand behind their back the
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
OCA is a
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
nonvoice and I don't think that that is
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
really in the public interest and I hope
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the commit that this honorable
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
committee will take that into account
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you for the
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make to present my
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
position thank you for your testimony
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
questions okay there no questions very
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
Beck B but not
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
Bruce there's a difference exactly thank
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
you sir yeah that's
 
01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh good morning uh my name is Bruce
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
Burke I live in
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield uh I'm just an ordinary
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in the state and I thought I
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
would share a couple comments this
 
01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
morning uh it strikes me again I'm not
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
an expert on distributive power what
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
should the Pu allow or not allow in
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
terms of allowances that ever Source can
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
get back that's all above my pay grade
 
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:33.639 align:start position:0%
um what strikes me as listening to
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
testimony today is uh I think it's
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
really unusual and I I've heard it twice
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
now that members of the
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
St from opposing
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
parties both believe this is a bad Bill
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
I mean that should be bottom line for
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
people people who who who swim in this
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
water all the time and that's their
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
judgment uh I also say the beginning
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
conversation I heard I think I heard the
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors say that Energy
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
Efficiency is an ideological
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
issue I'm just a taxpayer I don't know
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
why fighting for cheaper rates is an
 
01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.790 align:start position:0%
why fighting for cheaper rates is an
ideological

01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
ideological
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
issue um very quickly I really only have
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
two points one is um I think we learned
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
in Middle School that the New Hampshire
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
legislature is the second largest
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
legislature in the
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
world uh which to me means that we value
 
01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.750 align:start position:0%
world uh which to me means that we value
many

01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:42:37.629 --> 01:42:37.639 align:start position:0%
voices we pride ourselves on many
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
voices and so logically it occurs to me
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we should believe that in terms of
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
many voices independent
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
voices working for the benefit of
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
second one is I I'm an Ever Source
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
customer uh you heard me I live in
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield you probably know a little
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
bit about Pittsfield we have really we
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
are struggling to and lots of families
 
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
struggling to uh balance paying our
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
bills etc etc etc so I just feel like uh
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
as just an ordinary citizen that I trust
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
an independent voice to make the best
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
decision for us the tax
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and I'm not
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
sure uh if the consumer Advocate becomes
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
part of the doe that they'll have that
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
kind of Independence you've heard it
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
before but as a person on ground level
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's my fear too uh I'd be happy to
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
take your questions uh but thank you for
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
the time and thank you for your
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
service thank you are there any
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.400 --> 01:44:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
Alec

01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
omor good morning uh for the record my
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
name is Alec Oma and I am the director
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
of external Affairs at
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
Unitil uh Unitil for those who may not
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
be familiar with us in the room uh as
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is not an energy committee we are a
 
01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
gas and electric utility in the state of
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we serve very specific
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
parts of the state we provide electric
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
service here in conquer we also provide
 
01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:31.719 align:start position:0%
gas and electric service in the New
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sea Coast Area uh Unitil has
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
no formal position on this bill but we
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
did want to come in and emphasize to you
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh what the value of this office is in
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
our opinion and what we believe it means
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
to the process and that comes back to
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
this concept of Independence that has
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
been talked about quite a bit today um
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
from our perspective as we go about
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
serving our customers uh our focus is on
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we are using our
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
Distribution Systems in a manner that
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
enables the things that our customers
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
want to do while at the same time
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the energy we provide them
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
remains affordable and reliable it is a
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
balancing act that we are constantly
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with trying to make sure we're
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
doing in a way that takes into account a
 
01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
wide array of stakeholders throughout
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that process the office of the consumer
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
Advocate is a crucial part of that
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
process in that it has an independent
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
voice that represents the interests of
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
the rate payers and maintaining
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
affordability uh Independence has been
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
talked about a lot today I want to go
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
back to uh really underline the way that
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
I think representative Harrington put it
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
because that really aligns with what I
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to try and say today here is uh
 
01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:49.960 align:start position:0%
we started off talking about
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
independence in terms of political
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
appointment and whether or there was
 
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
true Independence in that way uh I think
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington put it very
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
eloquently when he pointed out that
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a red herring
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
here what we're really talking about is
 
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
independence of
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
intent the Office of Consumer advocacy
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
has a specific intent which is to
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
represent the voice of the rate payer
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the process on energy matters
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
that can be before the Public Utilities
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
Commission that can be before the uh
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
legislators talking about policy matters
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
that can be work sessions that can be
 
01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:26.679 align:start position:0%
communicating directly to us as a
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
utility in terms of points of view uh
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
that is one aspect as to what the
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy as a whole looks at
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
but we believe that that point of view
 
01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
is very important and deserves to have
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
its own independent voice so independent
 
01:46:45.149 --> 01:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
of intent as opposed to Independent of
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
overall political structure I think is
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
the important thing to focus on and we
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
would ask this committee to weigh the
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
value of that independent as they look
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
at this bill happy to answer any
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
questions you have thank you don't see
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
any questions think we've worn ourselves
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
out on the previous speakers
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
mcder good morning Madam chair and and
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
committee appreciate you listen to my
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is Patrick mcdermit
 
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
I'm the volunteer state president for
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
AARP New Hampshire and I'm here
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
representing our
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
212,000 New Hampshire
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
members I live in hookit New Hampshire
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
and I have more than four Decades of
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
electric utility experience here in the
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I'm here to
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
testify against House Bill 610 which
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
would weaken the office of the consumer
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate as we've heard by placing it
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
within the department of energy
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
and by reducing its staff there's really
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
three main reasons we find this bill
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
problematic one has been talked about
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so I won't belabor it the
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
independence of the consumer Advocate is
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
crucial for Effective act Advocacy
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
number two advocacy for interest of
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
residential customers could be lost and
 
01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
diluted we've heard that before as well
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
because the department of energy has so
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
many other
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities thirdly cutting the
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
staff down to three would impede the
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
office's ability to protect residential
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
utility customers the current staff is
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
already quite small compared to the many
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
and numerous
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers um staff and Consultants
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
employed by utility
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
companies the uh one example that I like
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
to bring up very briefly is that the
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
complexity of the current eversource
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
rate case and that's distribution rate
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
case um delivery rate case which
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
includes a proposal to replace a
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
traditional ratemaking process with a
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
more much more complicated formula
 
01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the importance of having a
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
robust Office of the consumer Advocate
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
to basically understand what's going on
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
and protect not only actually
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
residential customers but all customers
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
from these kind of changes this bill
 
01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
would weaken the voices of customers of
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
consumers resulting in higher rates and
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
less transparent Arcy and accountability
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
in utility
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
regulation I think the choice is simple
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
if you support consumers and lowering
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
utility cost you need to vote no on this
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
legislation I also have written
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that goes into a little more
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
detail thank you we'll be glad to have
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
that any
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
questions don't see any thank you I
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire legal assistance no
 
01:50:12.669 --> 01:50:12.679 align:start position:0%
relation to the Burke who previously
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
testified as far as I know um I'm here
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
today to provide this testimony in
 
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb610 um New Hampshire
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
legal assistance for those who don't
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
know is a Statewide nonprofit Law Firm
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
our attorneys and paralegals represent
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
low-income clients throughout the state
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
regarding various civil legal issues
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
including on behalf of clients in
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
dockets before the Public Utilities
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
Commission and in matters uh before the
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy regarding um
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
various utility uh related uh programs
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
um based on legal assistances experience
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
representing our low-income clients we
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and encourage the
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend the bill in
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate um in the
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
interest of time um I will just say I we
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
agree with much of what has been said by
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
others in opposition to this bill
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
notably representative Harrington Mr
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
Kirk um attorney Linder um we will just
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
mention that as a small nonprofit we
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to get involved
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
in every docket before the Pu or uh
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
speak on every matter uh before the
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
department of energy that impacts um
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
low-income residential ratee payers um
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
we regularly have to turn away clients
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
who have meritorious cases in the
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
various work that we do um and so we
 
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
believe that as others have said it's
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
crucial to have um an independent Office
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
of Consumer Advocate whose sole mission
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
is to represent the interest of all
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
residential ratee payers um we just
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
can't uh match the resources that they
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
have we do get involved in rate cases on
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of our clients every now and then
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
but we don't have the funding to hire
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
the consultants and subject matter
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
experts needed um on every single issue
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
so often our focus is very narrow um and
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
we rely heavily on the work uh that the
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and its staff and
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
Consultants do um in in those cases
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
um and I think I just want to underscore
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
some of what others said just to to uh
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
highlight in in terms of rates it is the
 
01:52:09.149 --> 01:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission that's the
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
ultimate decider that the consumer
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
Advocate um doesn't control what the
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
rates are but our experience like others
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
in the dockets uh is that the office of
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate does uh strongly
 
01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
um uh represent the interest of those
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
rate payers to to ensure um that rates
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
aren't uh increasing uh
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily um and and um we would
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
just uh be concerned as others have said
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
that that voice would go away if the
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
office is folded in with uh the
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy um and with that I
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
I know we're already far over so I'll
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
take questions if there are any but I
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
just checking if I can still say good
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
morning uh good morning Michael Lata
 
01:53:07.390 --> 01:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
before you this morning just by way of
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
background eversource uh provides
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
electric distribution and transmission
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
service to 140 uh retail customers in
 
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
206 communities here in New Hampshire as
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
well as 180 uh I'm sorry 540,000 uh
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
100,000 residential customers as well as
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
180 uh thousand wholesale customers um I
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll be brief in my comments a
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
lot has been said uh I I do want to say
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate the intent to look at
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
the regulatory process and try to
 
01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
identify ways to make it more efficient
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
and we certainly think that it is
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
evaluate the roles of the Public
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the department of
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
energy as well as the consumer Advocate
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
now three years after the creation of
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy and there are
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
other pieces of legislation to look at
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
at the different roles and
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of those agencies uh we
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
do have concerns uh with the bill as it
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
has been introduced and are opposed uh
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
eversource as many others has testified
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh we believe that it is important to
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
have an independent office in state
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
government that represents the interest
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
of residential Ray payers uh matters
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
before the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
are technically complex and they are
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
adjudicated through quasi judicial
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
proceedings some of these proceedings
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
can last months and at times years and
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's why it's important for the
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
utility for the regulatory process and
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
most importantly for customers that
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
there is a voice and an advocate
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
representing the interest of residential
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
customers and that that uh Advocate is
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
independent of other state
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
agencies Our concern with the Bill's
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
approach is that it would make the
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and employee of the
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
Department of energy reporting to the
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner the doe is already an
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
active participant in proceedings before
 
01:55:09.149 --> 01:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and as
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
has been discussed their role is to
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
represent the public policy interests of
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
the executive branch Our concern is that
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
shifting the consumer Advocate under the
 
01:55:19.629 --> 01:55:19.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy would give the
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy an oversized role
 
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
at these proceedings essentially you
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
would have one state agency with two
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
seats at the table there are times when
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
the positions of the Department of
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
energy and the consumer Advocate may be
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
similar but there are similar uh also
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
just as many times when they will will
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
differ as the public priorities of the
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
executive branch May differ from the uh
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
Financial interests of residential rate
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
payers the bill sponsor uh talked about
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
how there is an inherent adversarial
 
01:55:52.709 --> 01:55:52.719 align:start position:0%
relationship between utilities and the
 
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and that is absolutely
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
correct uh there there is an appropriate
 
01:55:59.069 --> 01:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
and healthy amount of tension if if both
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
the utility and the consumer Advocate
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
are doing their job and so it does beg
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
the question as he did ask uh why we
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be before you today expressing our
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
concerns uh about preserving the
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
independence of this office and to that
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
I would just say that like any business
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
utilities uh seek consistency and
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
certainty in Regulatory and statutory
 
01:56:24.030 --> 01:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
processes and we believe that this bill
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
and it would represent a significant
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
change and have uh significant long-term
 
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences and with that
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
that the committee may
 
01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
have thank you I don't see any so very
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair and members and
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
I can still say good morning by two
 
01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
minutes uh my name is Dana N I live in
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
samton I am the chair of the residential
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
rate payers Advisory Board appointed by
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
the governor to represent small
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
businesses I am in opposition to hb610
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
is it will be detrimental to New
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
payers I've been on in an intervenor on
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
numerous dockets at the Pu from 2004 to
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
2012 during these N9 years I became a
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
parent of the value of the Office of
 
01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
Consumer Advocate excuse me I've have
 
01:57:31.870 --> 01:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
also been collaborating with the office
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
the governor's office of energy and
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
Community Services which was named in
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
2000 and now it's the
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
doe and I can see that the independence
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
of the OC is very crucial unlike
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in New Hampshire the
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
OCA relies on the
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
independence changing the OCA from the
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
current independent status to operate
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
under the doe commissioner would only
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
disempower the OCA and its commitment to
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
serving the public good in 2020 and
 
01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
2024 I have been a member and a chair of
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
a non-political committee to recommend
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
to the governor for the consumer
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
advocate for the next four years which
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
resulted in the reappointment of
 
01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.550 align:start position:0%
resulted in the reappointment of
attorney

01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
Tre this
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
committee as it took six months we would
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
put put put out a survey to politicians
 
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
utilities nonprofit state employees and
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
to the public and with this survey
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
would' come back and make an an
 
01:58:36.990 --> 01:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
assumption of what the people really
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
wanted for the consumer Advocate and it
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
always came out to Mr Cree to be
 
01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
reappointed in conclusion as chairs The
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board in support of the OCA and
 
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
the residential rirs I request that h 3
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
610 go to
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%

01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
you don't see any
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
questions the advantage of coming late
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
alms and if I talk fast it's still good
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
morning uh good morning Madam chair
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:59:21.629 --> 01:59:21.639 align:start position:0%
I am Chris Elms I'm the Deputy
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioner the New Hampshire
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the department
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
takes no position on the bill uh as we
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
do view it as the legislature's
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
prerogative to determine the structure
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
of government um I will say that if if
 
01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
this committee does want to move forward
 
01:59:38.189 --> 01:59:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh with the bill we do uh see a little
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
bit of a lack of clarity uh on the
 
01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
position transfer question that was
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier in the hearing um we
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work with you if if
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are uh you you know just on on
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
what whatever it is that you want to
 
01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
have happen so if there are existing
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
positions at the consumer Advocate that
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
you want to come to the department we
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
would probably have language to suggest
 
02:00:00.790 --> 02:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that happens uh as
 
02:00:03.390 --> 02:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
smoothly as possible our business office
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
um as sort of the uh agency to which the
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
OCA is administratively attached to
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
handles the back office functions for
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
both agencies and um would would help to
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
clarify uh whatever the intent of the
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
committee is uh happy to work with you
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
Andor the prime sponsor um but other
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
than that happy to take questions okay
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that are there any any
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson I'll break the mold for a
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
second the absorption of these positions
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
by the doe comes without
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
funding if I'm reading this right okay
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
so do you have the ability within the
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
budget that you guys run under to absorb
 
02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:50.589 align:start position:0%
budget that you guys run under to absorb
these

02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
positions without having an additional
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
funding source to provide for those
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
positions uh I it's a good question
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I think uh that
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
really does to to my point earlier
 
02:01:04.189 --> 02:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
depend on whether or not you want to
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
transfer the existing positions uh
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
within the consumer Advocates office to
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
the department or whether or not you are
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
abolishing those positions and creating
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
new ones um if if you are simply
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
transferring all it's the same funding
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
source uh for the consumer Advocate as
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
it is for the Department of energy so we
 
02:01:24.149 --> 02:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
would see that it's simply a transfer um
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
but that's again up to the committee uh
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
right now the bill is unclear what the
 
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:29.950 align:start position:0%
right now the bill is unclear what the
intent

02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
is but if the positions were to be
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
abolished you would need a different
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
funding source is that correct correct
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
unless we were uh the intention was that
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
we repurposed existing positions which
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
we would have you know obviously we have
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
our work to to get done so okay thank
 
02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:50.629 align:start position:0%
our work to to get done so okay thank
you

02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%

occurred on Monday whether the fiscal

okay for planning purposes
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
committee we're going to do as as many
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to exec as many bills as we
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
can today as we're ready we and then
 
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to do all the rest of
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
them next week
 
02:59:43.269 --> 02:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
provided uh because that that'll give us
 
02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
time to get the reports in prior to the
 
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
deadline we can slip one or two if we
 
02:59:51.429 --> 02:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
have to but I really hope we don't have
 
02:59:51.439 --> 02:59:54.469 align:start position:0%
have to but I really hope we don't have
to

02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:57.469 --> 02:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
um and after that at this point I don't
 
02:59:59.070 --> 02:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
know of anything until we start getting
 
03:00:03.469 --> 03:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.630 --> 03:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
and all right we
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
have representative Howard okay we have
 
03:00:14.750 --> 03:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
first house bill
 
03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%

basic changes it changes uh one of the
 
03:01:04.269 --> 03:01:04.279 align:start position:0%
requirements of the committee uh to uh
 
03:01:06.030 --> 03:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
have a member of executive departments
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
and administration uh be a part uh of
 
03:01:12.269 --> 03:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
the commission and it would also change
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
things uh specifically uh section three
 
03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
part C and D it would allow ow the
 
03:01:20.190 --> 03:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
commission to develop criteria process
 
03:01:21.950 --> 03:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
for accepting and a deadline for
 
03:01:24.910 --> 03:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
submission of flag designs and it would
 
03:01:26.630 --> 03:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
then allow the commission to determine
 
03:01:28.750 --> 03:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
how many designs they want to consider
 
03:01:30.910 --> 03:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
and how to narrow down the number uh of
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
design submissions uh that kind of
 
03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
covers it and I hope for your support
 
03:01:39.630 --> 03:01:39.640 align:start position:0%

the most part with a lot of the
 
03:04:54.910 --> 03:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
discussions that have happened already
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
and uh again just just as a reminder
 
03:04:59.150 --> 03:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
this does not necessarily mean that
 
03:05:01.389 --> 03:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
anything is being changed it's just
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
providing a mechanism to take a look and
 
03:05:05.309 --> 03:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
if we decide we want to keep things the
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
way they are so be it
 
03:05:12.389 --> 03:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay Lon uh thank you madam chair I
 
03:05:14.110 --> 03:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
personally really like the current New
 
03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire flag um if everybody decides
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
to have a commission and go through the
 
03:05:19.950 --> 03:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
process I understand that but I like the
 
03:05:22.429 --> 03:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
flag so that's why I won't be voting for
 
03:05:24.269 --> 03:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended but I understand why
 
03:05:24.279 --> 03:05:26.229 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended but I understand why
others

03:05:26.229 --> 03:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
would anyone else have a comment
 
03:05:28.760 --> 03:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
would anyone else have a comment
question

03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
concern I'd like to say that I'm not
 
03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
sure that a uh a six-month commission
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
will do much good
 
03:05:42.070 --> 03:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
remember if this Commission comes up
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
with a proposal that we like we will
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
support it if we don't like it no matter
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
how much the theory of looking at the
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
situation because it's going to be the
 
03:06:03.070 --> 03:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
current flag against whatever proposal
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
is is offered by the commission if we
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
like the new proposal
 
03:06:10.309 --> 03:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
better then we then it makes sense to go
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
in that direction if we don't like it we
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
know what we've
 
03:06:16.389 --> 03:06:16.399 align:start position:0%

background checks to be sent to the
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
office as opposed to a particular person
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
so the language that is in here
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
regarding background
 
03:10:31.510 --> 03:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
checks um criminal history background
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
checks is from the Department of Safety
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
and in conjunction between the
 
03:10:39.229 --> 03:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the oplc
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
attorney so this is the language that
 
03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
attorney so this is the language that
was

03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:10:48.870 --> 03:10:48.880 align:start position:0%

03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh other parts of the bill let me just
 
03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:55.510 align:start position:0%
uh other parts of the bill let me just
go

03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
back there were some um amend there were
 
03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:00.680 align:start position:0%

regarding uh section 39 that had to do
 
03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
regarding uh section 39 that had to do
with

03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
electricians the amendment says that um
 
03:11:10.269 --> 03:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:11:13.389 --> 03:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
examination at their at their expense um
 
03:11:13.399 --> 03:11:14.830 align:start position:0%
examination at their at their expense um
can

03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:11:18.269 --> 03:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
be they can take it over and if they've
 
03:11:21.190 --> 03:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
not passed the examination with within
 
03:11:24.510 --> 03:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
one year of the office receiving their
 
03:11:26.710 --> 03:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
application then it's assumed that they
 
03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to further continue and the
 
03:11:35.070 --> 03:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
re ah so that after one year they have
 
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
to submit a new application yes
 
03:11:48.190 --> 03:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:51.309 --> 03:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
oh yes you might remember that there was
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
a discussion about the radiation therapy
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
section and that if one license could
 
03:12:00.110 --> 03:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
apply to all
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
modalities and this was done in that was
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
taken up in the amendment this was part
 
03:12:07.870 --> 03:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
of uh chair Maguire's Amendment to the
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
original bill so that change was
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%

03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:16.920 align:start position:0%

03:18:18.870 --> 03:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
what's he talking
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
about all right uh representative gr you
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your M
 
03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair the concern
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
that the um committee had with the
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
previous bills concerning background
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
checks were were addressed and this is
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
similar language this is a language that
 
03:18:43.469 --> 03:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
we're using for all um lenses and um
 
03:18:46.030 --> 03:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
that require background checks it was
 
03:18:49.830 --> 03:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
discussed that we should make this a
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
practice under the general RSA for the
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
oplc but the response from the
 
03:18:58.269 --> 03:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety was that they
 
03:18:59.830 --> 03:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
requested that we put it under each
 
03:19:01.790 --> 03:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
individual licenses which is why it
 
03:19:01.800 --> 03:19:02.990 align:start position:0%
individual licenses which is why it
appears

03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
appears
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
here um but the rest of it has not
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
changed so the compact remains as it was
 
03:19:10.510 --> 03:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee
 
03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%

03:20:08.950 --> 03:20:08.960 align:start position:0%

145 is there a
 
03:20:11.080 --> 03:20:13.429 align:start position:0%
145 is there a
second

03:20:13.429 --> 03:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:20:15.429 --> 03:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
here all right do you wish to speak to
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
03:20:21.630 --> 03:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
the um testimony that was presented to
 
03:20:23.429 --> 03:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
the committee concerning the
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
compact um demonstrated for the for the
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
need for this contact in the example of
 
03:20:31.990 --> 03:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
the woman who pays licensing fees in
 
03:20:35.910 --> 03:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
multiple States and although it's not it
 
03:20:38.110 --> 03:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
may be that the states that are involved
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
in this compact are not all-encompassing
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
it does reduce the cost of having a
 
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
multi-state compact I'm licensed for a
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
particular profession therefore I would
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
support this I would recommend the
 
03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
committee support this bill okay
 
03:20:54.910 --> 03:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
represent Pearson do you to speak to
 
03:20:54.920 --> 03:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
represent Pearson do you to speak to
your

03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
second uh sure the the amendment part we
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
just talked we just covered that dealt
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
with the background check part of that
 
03:21:05.189 --> 03:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
which is actually separate from the
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
compact um the conditions of that my
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
concern was that if we made an
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment we would affect an existing
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
compact that is not the case so we're in
 
03:21:15.150 --> 03:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
the clear there the other thing is that
 
03:21:18.469 --> 03:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
this bill just a reminder it's it h it's
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
a privilege to practice model so that it
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
is possible to be able to do this
 
03:21:25.790 --> 03:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
outside of the compact in New Hampshire
 
03:21:29.189 --> 03:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
so you the folks that do this that have
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
no desire to be part of that don't have
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be part of that so which is a little
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
unusual because other compacts are kind
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
of you're in it it just is so in this
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
case um they they they've got a lot of
 
03:21:45.950 --> 03:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
freedom here so um cleaning up the
 
03:21:47.670 --> 03:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
background check part we're we're
 
03:21:49.150 --> 03:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
confident that that's going to take care
 
03:21:51.189 --> 03:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that happened this is
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
language that came out of the Department
 
03:21:53.469 --> 03:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
of Education that has already been
 
03:21:54.990 --> 03:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
vetted through the FBI they already
 
03:21:56.349 --> 03:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
existing they use it in the Department
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
of Education so we're presuming and
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that that should be okay if we're
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
doing it in another agency so um other
 
03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:07.630 align:start position:0%
doing it in another agency so um other
than

03:22:07.630 --> 03:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
that it's uh it it is as it was in the
 
03:22:14.070 --> 03:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
hearing representative lamb um thank you
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I just want to clarify
 
03:22:17.830 --> 03:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is not yet been adopted by enough
 
03:22:19.870 --> 03:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
states to be active is that
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
correct so what happens with compacts
 
03:22:26.189 --> 03:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
and we've seen this time and time again
 
03:22:28.030 --> 03:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
here is there
 
03:22:32.189 --> 03:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
is there's an incentive to to be the
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
ones that make it go if you will right
 
03:22:38.110 --> 03:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
because it seems as though all of these
 
03:22:40.030 --> 03:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
compacts are structured in a way that
 
03:22:40.040 --> 03:22:41.349 align:start position:0%
compacts are structured in a way that
the

03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
first depending on how many states it
 
03:22:45.229 --> 03:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
requires say as an example if it
 
03:22:48.189 --> 03:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
requires Nine States to be ratified the
 
03:22:51.389 --> 03:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
first nine get a seat at a at a bigger
 
03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
table if you will right because that
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
table then has more of like an executive
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
board type role in some of the decisions
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
that go on with adjusting and modifying
 
03:23:01.760 --> 03:23:02.510 align:start position:0%
that go on with adjusting and modifying
the

03:23:02.510 --> 03:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:04.630 align:start position:0%
the
compact

03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
compact
 
03:23:07.510 --> 03:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
um it's it's the structure of the
 
03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
compact exists as it is they they're not
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a restructuring but it's it's a
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
tweaking of some things so so what
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
happens with that is is there is a huge
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
advantage to being at the table the big
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
boy table if you will table in the first
 
03:23:26.110 --> 03:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
group correct in in the sense of the
 
03:23:31.510 --> 03:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
executive board level um that would be
 
03:23:33.550 --> 03:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
and that's covered in in the compact it
 
03:23:36.750 --> 03:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
it actually specifies and outlines how
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
that works so the the the concern that I
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
always have with compacts is what what
 
03:23:43.670 --> 03:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire's ability to get out of
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
a compact because we've had to do that
 
03:23:48.990 --> 03:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
before as well and that as we heard in
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and as I highlighted here on
 
03:23:54.510 --> 03:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
page 20 we have the ability to withdraw
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
from this Compact and um that is um
 
03:24:01.229 --> 03:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
that's just an important element at
 
03:24:05.189 --> 03:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
least to me where the compact has the
 
03:24:07.229 --> 03:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
ability through its executive board to
 
03:24:09.269 --> 03:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
tweak and modify potentially to the
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
point where the the folks in New
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire go you know what we're out we
 
03:24:16.590 --> 03:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
don't we don't like this so um this this
 
03:24:18.269 --> 03:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
has that in it other compacts that we've
 
03:24:20.950 --> 03:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
been ENT entered into in the past have
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
had a more complicated process to
 
03:24:27.150 --> 03:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
withdraw so uh in that case here um
 
03:24:29.150 --> 03:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's great the military spouses are
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
also as specifically addressed in this
 
03:24:36.189 --> 03:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
compact um which is great
 
03:24:38.910 --> 03:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
that clarifies some muddy water that you
 
03:24:41.229 --> 03:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
get into sometimes as far as what is a
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
home state and um their ability to
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
function within the compact in the sense
 
03:24:49.389 --> 03:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
that they're mobile due to their
 
03:24:49.399 --> 03:24:51.790 align:start position:0%
that they're mobile due to their
military

03:24:51.790 --> 03:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
military
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
commitments beyond that I mean it's uh
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
like I said it's it's as it was
 
03:24:58.790 --> 03:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
presented in the hearing repres um thank
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
you with that it my question would be if
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
um the going changing from a privilege
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
to practice compact to one where you're
 
03:25:09.389 --> 03:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
required to have lure if that's
 
03:25:10.750 --> 03:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
something that would be an easy change
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
and then we would be facing a tital wave
 
03:25:16.950 --> 03:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
of then leaving this compact if uh if if
 
03:25:18.189 --> 03:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
we don't like the terms I'm very
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about about that issue because
 
03:25:23.670 --> 03:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
if it you're able to change those terms
 
03:25:25.590 --> 03:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
which it can and it hasn't yet been set
 
03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
if the other states that come on board
 
03:25:30.910 --> 03:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
require the lure of this practice in
 
03:25:32.429 --> 03:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
order to be part of the compact that's
 
03:25:33.630 --> 03:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
something that would concern me
 
03:25:35.469 --> 03:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
significantly so that's up to the state
 
03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in this case because
 
03:25:40.830 --> 03:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
yes except if we've accepted the policy
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
of doing this and that this is a great
 
03:25:45.269 --> 03:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
way to license all of this and everybody
 
03:25:48.189 --> 03:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
who is licensed by loves it then it's a
 
03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
significant uphill battle at that point
 
03:25:52.189 --> 03:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's just my concern that um once you
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
get the momentum going it's pretty hard
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
to stop it that's a personal concern on
 
03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts we don't really need
 
03:25:59.550 --> 03:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
to debate that more but this is one of
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
compacts okay in the in the sense that
 
03:26:10.349 --> 03:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
we have a provision to for Licensing in
 
03:26:12.750 --> 03:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire outside of the compact
 
03:26:14.070 --> 03:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
which we have the authority to do
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually with all compacts you just
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't the benefit of a compact if you
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
are not in under their conditions you
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
just operate here with in the sense of
 
03:26:25.269 --> 03:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
lacking reciprocity anywhere else W
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
which is a self-imposed circumstance in
 
03:26:29.950 --> 03:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
this case if you choose not to meet the
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
conditions of of any compact um in this
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
case the state of New Hampshire is
 
03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
saying we we allow provision for that
 
03:26:40.269 --> 03:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
whereas in some compact like the EMS
 
03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
compact was the same way when we entered
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
into that we still retain New Hampshire
 
03:26:46.469 --> 03:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
licenses people still operated here you
 
03:26:47.790 --> 03:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have to participate in the
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
compact if you chose not to so I no
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
other state has the authority to dictate
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
to to us to not allow an
 
03:26:58.750 --> 03:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
intrastate licensing that that's solely
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
up to the individual
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
State what right and so I recognize that
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
I just don't appre I I don't personally
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
like consolidating power outside of the
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
state it's that's my point of view got
 
03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay I got thank you sure okay anyone
 
03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative I kind of
 
03:27:18.750 --> 03:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
feel the same way but representative
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
Pearson has alled my concerns okay I'd
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
like to comment that I'm going to vote
 
03:27:29.349 --> 03:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
against this because I disapprove of the
 
03:27:31.870 --> 03:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
compact the way it is written we are
 
03:27:35.790 --> 03:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
signing up today to have their the
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
compact rules have the effect of law in
 
03:27:40.910 --> 03:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we don't know what
 
03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
they are I believe that's
 
03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um various and I'm not
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to vote for for any compact that
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
has has that in there this one is
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
particularly aggravating because the
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
rules haven't yet been written if we
 
03:27:57.840 --> 03:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
rules haven't yet been written if we
were

03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:28:01.630 --> 03:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
to have a vote on the nurse compact for
 
03:28:03.429 --> 03:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
example we know what the rules are we've
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
seen them they exist this case we don't
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
know what they are and we are requiring
 
03:28:14.189 --> 03:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves to um to obey them represent
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
zch can't we get out of it sure well
 
03:28:20.590 --> 03:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
then what's the harm we can if we can
 
03:28:22.510 --> 03:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
well it's my
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
personal okay contention that our
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
constitution F forbids us from adopting
 
03:28:30.510 --> 03:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
any rule not approved by our
 
03:28:32.750 --> 03:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives by the people or their
 
03:28:35.309 --> 03:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
elected representatives and this is that
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
case the fact that we can backtrack is
 
03:28:41.830 --> 03:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
irrelevant in my opinion I may be wrong
 
03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
but that's how I feel in that case then
 
03:28:46.830 --> 03:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
in this particular case if we were one
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
initiating we are we are one of the
 
03:28:52.229 --> 03:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
states that is involved in the rul
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
making process um
 
03:28:58.910 --> 03:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
but I guess then under under your
 
03:28:58.920 --> 03:29:00.309 align:start position:0%
but I guess then under under your
premise

03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
premise
 
03:29:02.750 --> 03:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
then we would
 
03:29:04.990 --> 03:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
never the state of New Hampshire would
 
03:29:07.590 --> 03:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
never sit on an executive board of a
 
03:29:09.710 --> 03:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
compact then because you would want that
 
03:29:12.389 --> 03:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
figured out and then we decide whether
 
03:29:16.269 --> 03:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
we would op wrong but but the other
 
03:29:18.269 --> 03:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
point I want to make which may or may
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
not be convincing is that we have a very
 
03:29:26.429 --> 03:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
robust reciprocity or Lure by
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
endorsement so we can bring outof State
 
03:29:32.830 --> 03:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
dietitians in with a very simple process
 
03:29:34.990 --> 03:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
get them licensed they can work here
 
03:29:38.110 --> 03:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
this compact is to allow New Hampshire
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
dietitians to work elsewhere and so I'm
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
not convinced it's necessarily for the
 
03:29:48.189 --> 03:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:50.349 --> 03:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
it may be good for the individuals I
 
03:29:53.710 --> 03:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
can't deny that but uh that's that's a
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
secondary Point comment I just want make
 
03:29:58.750 --> 03:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
that the re the robust reciprocity is
 
03:30:04.590 --> 03:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
true however they still have to pay a
 
03:30:06.670 --> 03:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
licensing fee in two states or three
 
03:30:09.790 --> 03:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
states or whatever so this basically
 
03:30:13.110 --> 03:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
consolidates um the payment of one
 
03:30:17.550 --> 03:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
license for many States whatever states
 
03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
are part of the compact so I think that
 
03:30:22.510 --> 03:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
is helpful to those lenses and
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
particular the women who I think pays a
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
license in 10 states no so that's a
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
significant cost to
 
03:30:30.960 --> 03:30:32.469 align:start position:0%
significant cost to
her

03:30:32.469 --> 03:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:30:34.830 --> 03:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's what the people who came to
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing were testifying that they
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
liked having one license instead of many
 
03:30:44.670 --> 03:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.429 --> 03:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
else all all right in that case the
 
03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass with Amendment
 
03:30:51.389 --> 03:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
on House
 
03:30:54.830 --> 03:30:54.840 align:start position:0%

to the first New Hampshire Commission on
 
03:37:39.870 --> 03:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs in 2010 when it
 
03:37:42.269 --> 03:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
was established and then I was elected
 
03:37:44.309 --> 03:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
chairman of the commission when the
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
first chair term
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
expired so we would like to thank uh
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
chair Carol Maguire for bringing this
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill forward and for rep wheer and rep
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
Reed who co-sponsored the
 
03:37:59.030 --> 03:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that the committee is going
 
03:38:04.510 --> 03:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
to hear testimony that may seem a bit
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
confusing um American Indian law is
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
complex and it's not well
 
03:38:12.269 --> 03:38:12.279 align:start position:0%
understood many of us have been
 
03:38:14.110 --> 03:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
approached by Family close friends and
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
Neighbors in the last days letting us
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
know they signed into the portal to
 
03:38:19.469 --> 03:38:19.479 align:start position:0%
oppose the evil
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill that um allows uh that would turn
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
things over to the evil state of Vermont
 
03:38:27.990 --> 03:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's been some active social media
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
campaigns that report that this bill
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
does many bad things including those two
 
03:38:34.429 --> 03:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh many of which aren't even in the bill
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to try to keep my testimony
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
to the scope of the bill which is simply
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
how we appoint um members to the
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
commission on Native Affairs and and
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a change in process and
 
03:38:47.640 --> 03:38:48.469 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a change in process and
some

03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications so there's a couple of
 
03:38:53.550 --> 03:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
pieces in my testimony you'll find and
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
I'll email this out to the committee
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
later there's links to all kinds of
 
03:38:59.870 --> 03:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
websites where you can get all the facts
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh the details for Native American
 
03:39:05.150 --> 03:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
law but there's two books I'll draw your
 
03:39:06.990 --> 03:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
attention to and one is American Indians
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
in the law by uh Dr and Bruce duu and
 
03:39:13.150 --> 03:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate to have him at
 
03:39:16.269 --> 03:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth he's an expert in and law
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
relating to tribal sovereignty and
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
political relations with state and
 
03:39:22.189 --> 03:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
federal governments and the first
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph out of his book I think sets a
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
really good stage for what we're going
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
today at their core most legal disputes
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
involve conflicts over power money or
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
respect or some combination of those
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
elements the legal battles involving
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
American Indian tribes are particularly
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
volatile since they often involved
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
challenges relating to all three of
 
03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:43.550 align:start position:0%
challenges relating to all three of
these

03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
areas This Book used uses the lens of
 
03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.319 align:start position:0%

2008 and I did ask Dr duu if there was
 
03:41:30.750 --> 03:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
anything better or more modern and other
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
than his book which was also published
 
03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
in 2008 he said that this was the best
 
03:41:36.630 --> 03:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
Authority on state
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
recognition in the last few years States
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
and tribes have increasingly realized
 
03:41:42.349 --> 03:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
that state recognition can serve as an
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
important Al Limited alternative to
 
03:41:48.149 --> 03:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
Federal recognition this realization is
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the many states that have
 
03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
recently certified their state
 
03:41:53.710 --> 03:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
recognition process or are planning to
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
implement recognition processes to
 
03:41:58.189 --> 03:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
facilitate communication between State
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
and tribal governments and better the
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
condition of tribal members and
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities State
 
03:42:05.710 --> 03:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
recognition can also provide tribes with
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
limited state and federal benefits and
 
03:42:11.950 --> 03:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
they use an example but I'll give you um
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
the best example is the Indian arts and
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
crafts act which is a federal law that
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
as soon as a tribe is recognized
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country then all members
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
of that tribal groups so abanaki in our
 
03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
case have to comply with the Indian arts
 
03:42:30.750 --> 03:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
and crafts act to sell their arts and
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
crafts so that's the kind of limited
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
nature we're not federal tribes get a
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
lot of benefits they get money they get
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
gambling rights they get all kinds of
 
03:42:41.469 --> 03:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
things state recognized tribes have none
 
03:42:42.910 --> 03:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
of that but they do have a government
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
toover relationship consequent ly
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
several tribes are now bidding for State
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
recognition and many states are
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
implementing or strengthening processes
 
03:42:52.510 --> 03:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
for acknowledging the tribes within
 
03:42:52.520 --> 03:42:53.349 align:start position:0%
for acknowledging the tribes within
their

03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:42:55.950 --> 03:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
borders so you may wonder why I'm
 
03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
talking about recognition because it
 
03:42:59.229 --> 03:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
seems to go beyond the scope of this
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
bill except that what this bill does is
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
currently there are no members of
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes on the commission and
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
applications of recognized tribal
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
members to the commission have not
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
resulted and people being Seated on the
 
03:43:20.149 --> 03:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
commission and so uh and then last year
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony in this committee
 
03:43:24.269 --> 03:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
when the commission came forward and
 
03:43:26.790 --> 03:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
stated that the Indian arts and crafts
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't apply to the state of New
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I was tasked by the
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee to check with the Indian arts
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
and crafts board to find out if that was
 
03:43:37.189 --> 03:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
so and indeed federal law does applied
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire like the other 50
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
states so I I think it's really
 
03:43:44.189 --> 03:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
important that uh we all we think it's
 
03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
really important that the people that
 
03:43:47.670 --> 03:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
sit on the commission are people that
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
are subject to the complex laws and
 
03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
understand them and can better prepare
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
the state and the the state departments
 
03:43:58.590 --> 03:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.149 --> 03:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
um the when the New Hampshire commission
 
03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
so the the other thing you'll probably
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
hear about you know and I I made
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
reference to it is that we're evil
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont Indians so I was born in New
 
03:44:16.870 --> 03:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as were was my mother and and
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
my ancestors going back to very very
 
03:44:19.319 --> 03:44:20.670 align:start position:0%
my ancestors going back to very very
early

03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
early
 
03:44:23.870 --> 03:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
days in 2010 there were two bills
 
03:44:25.590 --> 03:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
happening on either side of the state
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
and for Stu I mean of the river both
 
03:44:29.910 --> 03:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
States New Hampshire and Vermont and for
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
students of History you may realize that
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Vermont was one area
 
03:44:37.630 --> 03:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
and it was after the revolution before
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont broke away from New
 
03:44:42.670 --> 03:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our tribal land has always
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
been New Hampshire and Vermont so his
 
03:44:48.189 --> 03:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
historically the two states have been
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
connected for abanaki people of course
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
today there's a big difference between
 
03:44:54.790 --> 03:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
politics in Vermont and politics in New
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but uh for us as native people
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
we have kin on both sides of the river
 
03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
so in 2010 there was a bill in both the
 
03:45:05.309 --> 03:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house and in the Vermont
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
legislature and the one in New Hampshire
 
03:45:09.550 --> 03:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
originally was presented to recognized
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
the abanaki and created a commission on
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
Native Affairs one of the things I
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
learned in my time in the legisl is that
 
03:45:17.229 --> 03:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
we have a motto my husband says it
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
should be the new state motto that is
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
now is not the time and what we learned
 
03:45:25.870 --> 03:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
was in 16 in uh 2010 for House Bill 1610
 
03:45:27.670 --> 03:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature felt like now was not
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
the time to recognize the abanaki but it
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
was the time to form a commission on
 
03:45:34.950 --> 03:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
Native Affairs so we got that done
 
03:45:38.149 --> 03:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
Vermont on the other hand decided now is
 
03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
the time for them to recognize the
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
abanaki so prior to Vermont recognizing
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
their four tribes in 201
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
we were just all an ethnic group a
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
minority group subject to the full
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the United States but as
 
03:45:55.070 --> 03:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
soon as that law got passed in Vermont
 
03:45:58.149 --> 03:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
that was when federal law impacted me
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
and I would be illegal to do what I had
 
03:46:03.189 --> 03:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
been doing if I hadn't been fortunate to
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
be kin to the people in the Vermont
 
03:46:09.269 --> 03:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
tribes and be allowed to enroll in those
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
tribes so this notion that I'm somehow
 
03:46:13.950 --> 03:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
an evil Vermont Indian now who's trying
 
03:46:17.950 --> 03:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
to do some harm to New Hampshire Indians
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
is troubling it's harm it hurts I'm not
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:46:27.950 --> 03:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
so uh so at any rate since 2010 the
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
commission ran along quite well the last
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
five years is when we've started to see
 
03:46:36.870 --> 03:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
these problems and more uh recently I I
 
03:46:39.389 --> 03:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
passed around um some information from
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
darl Peasley he was a former I was
 
03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
elected or I was appointed as the
 
03:46:45.630 --> 03:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
genealogist on the first commission the
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
law used to have a genealogist appointed
 
03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
and I was um chairman of the board
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
chairman of the uh commission after um I
 
03:46:59.149 --> 03:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
served as Vice chairman Daryl Peasley is
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
here he's doesn't intend to speak but he
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
did pass around had me pass around some
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
information for you he served on the
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
commission as well and he was vice
 
03:47:09.790 --> 03:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
chairman at the end of his term and darl
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
has applied and been informed that the
 
03:47:14.670 --> 03:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
nomination committee did not forward his
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation to be appointed though
 
03:47:19.710 --> 03:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
he was praised for his previous service
 
03:47:22.830 --> 03:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
and said he was an excellent
 
03:47:24.870 --> 03:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
candidate and then there's letters in
 
03:47:27.990 --> 03:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
there from uh two of the chiefs of
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
tribes in Vermont who have citizens who
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire a residents of New
 
03:47:35.229 --> 03:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire advocating for their residents
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
who live here and like I said that
 
03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're Vermont
 
03:47:41.229 --> 03:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
Indians who crossed the river and came
 
03:47:43.750 --> 03:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire some maybe but the
 
03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
majority are New Hampshire residents who
 
03:47:47.550 --> 03:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
have always been New Hampshire
 
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
residents so in closing I'll just say
 
03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:54.750 align:start position:0%
residents so in closing I'll just say
that

03:47:54.750 --> 03:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:57.550 --> 03:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
um one of the things when uh that I
 
03:47:59.229 --> 03:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
learned on this committee and some of us
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
were talking at lunchtime about how much
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
you learn right once you get in here and
 
03:48:05.429 --> 03:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
and see how the law works I learned a
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
great deal about boards and commissions
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
because this committee handles so many
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
of them and I learned about the
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty of the governor making
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
appointments to the you know many of the
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
Committees and commissions complain
 
03:48:18.910 --> 03:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
about the difficulty of getting people
 
03:48:21.389 --> 03:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
appointed so this bill will change the
 
03:48:23.830 --> 03:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
appointment process and this was
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
something we had a meeting we were very
 
03:48:28.269 --> 03:48:28.279 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have some leadership from
 
03:48:30.149 --> 03:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate meet with a group
 
03:48:32.790 --> 03:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
of us and and some of these other groups
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
that are not recognized were invited to
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
attend the group but they they
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
declined at that meeting after hearing
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
what the issues have been the speaker of
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
the house was the one who recommended
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
that he would be willing to make the
 
03:48:46.510 --> 03:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
appointment if the chiefs of the tribes
 
03:48:50.070 --> 03:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
sent nominations to him that was not our
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
idea but it sounded it made perfect
 
03:48:56.590 --> 03:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
sense to us so um that's you'll see that
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill but the other piece is and this is
 
03:49:05.070 --> 03:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
a bit of a simplification but to help
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
you understand the issue you deal with a
 
03:49:09.870 --> 03:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
lot of boards and commissions you deal
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
with the licensing boards for plumbers
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
for doctors for many things if you think
 
03:49:17.830 --> 03:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
about a plumbers board and you think
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
about you know there's a lot of people
 
03:49:22.429 --> 03:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
around that do plumbing and they they do
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
a pretty good job of their own plumbing
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
familes plumbing what have you but
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed plumbers with the
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
notion of having a plumbers board
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
without a single licensed plumber and in
 
03:49:35.149 --> 03:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
fact licensed plumbers who oppose
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
licensing sit on the licensing board for
 
03:49:40.269 --> 03:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
plumbers make sense to this committee I
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
think not I think you wouldn't want to
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
do that likewise if you had
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
medical healers who use plant medicine
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
but they weren't Physicians that work in
 
03:49:52.229 --> 03:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they didn't believe in
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
Physicians that worked in hospitals
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
would you allow them to occupy the
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
medical board and not let doctors on the
 
03:50:03.149 --> 03:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
on the board so those are the things I'd
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
like to leave you with to think
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
about um we ask you to support House
 
03:50:11.790 --> 03:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 to assist us in moving ahead oh
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
there's one additional responsibility
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
that this bill also has and that is to
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
study recommendation so this bill does
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
not do anything other than to task the
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
commission to study the topic of
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
recognition and make a report back to
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
the general court um at the end of the
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
year and that's all I have to say does
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions I'll be happy
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
to take some thank you other questions
 
03:50:37.630 --> 03:50:37.640 align:start position:0%

03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%

have people who are online he will
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
probably check at some point if we don't
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
have that by the time that we're done
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%

room to check that well he is here he is

members as we move forward in our
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
discussion because there's people who

can just bring this down um and really
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
simplify it for me and this is my lack
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
of uh understanding of relations uh
 
03:51:55.630 --> 03:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire and
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
federally so it says um only enrolled
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
tribal citizens who reside in New
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall be nominated by the
 
03:52:03.359 --> 03:52:04.670 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall be nominated by the
chiefs

03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
chiefs
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the state recognized abanaki or
 
03:52:10.590 --> 03:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
federally recognized tribes and then a
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
couple lines down from that it says
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
members of the abanaki tribe tribes
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
recognized by the state of Vermont and
 
03:52:18.790 --> 03:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
federally recognized tribes in New
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
England are published in the Federal
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
Register dot do dot so is is the reason
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
is I'm so sorry abanaki people not
 
03:52:28.510 --> 03:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
recognized by the federal government
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
correct there are no federally
 
03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes and I I I I do explain
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
that in the full testimony on the cream
 
03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
colored paper that excuse me there's a a
 
03:52:41.429 --> 03:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
website that I connect you to for the
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
Bia and that's where all federal
 
03:52:46.750 --> 03:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
recognition petitions are listed and
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
they have three different sections
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's anyone who may have applied but
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for more paperwork to go
 
03:52:54.429 --> 03:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
in and then there's another page that
 
03:52:57.550 --> 03:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
has those who are currently in process
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
and open to public comment and then
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's those that are adjudicated so
 
03:53:05.149 --> 03:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
they've been denied or approved and
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see if you go to all three of
 
03:53:08.830 --> 03:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
those pages there's nobody from New
 
03:53:11.830 --> 03:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who has applied for federal
 
03:53:15.149 --> 03:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
recognition and um and no abanaki now
 
03:53:17.229 --> 03:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
there was an abanaki group from Vermont
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
that had applied for federal recognition
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
a while ago and they were denied um and
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
that was prior to the state recognition
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
happening in Vermont so the whole notion
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that what the speaker said was that
 
03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
if Chiefs of recognized tribes made
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
nominations to him then he would select
 
03:53:38.670 --> 03:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
from that pool and that he wanted to see
 
03:53:40.790 --> 03:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
both state recognized and federally
 
03:53:44.189 --> 03:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
recognized residents so the way that got
 
03:53:46.510 --> 03:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
wor worded and I apologize I'm I I know
 
03:53:48.630 --> 03:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's in this pile somewhere my copy of
 
03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
the bill but uh that
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
only recognized tribal members really
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
the only re refers to residents of New
 
03:53:59.189 --> 03:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we wanted to it to be clear
 
03:54:01.389 --> 03:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
that only residents of New Hampshire who
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in federal or state
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes would be um nominated
 
03:54:10.269 --> 03:54:10.279 align:start position:0%
to the speaker for um consideration to
 
03:54:12.469 --> 03:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
be appointed to the commission does that
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
answer that for you you could have a
 
03:54:13.920 --> 03:54:14.950 align:start position:0%
answer that for you you could have a
followup

03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
followup
 
03:54:14.960 --> 03:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
followup
thank

03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
you so I process a little slowly
 
03:54:22.389 --> 03:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes so so because AB that's the
 
03:54:25.229 --> 03:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
reference to Vermont in this bill is
 
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
because the abanag is not recognized by
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government but is recognized
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
by by state of that is the reason that
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
the state of ran is specifically
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
referenced here so that people have
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
abanaki people can be nominated by the
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
speaker to serve on the commission
 
03:54:43.229 --> 03:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
correct it is the government
 
03:54:46.030 --> 03:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
authorization or the government
 
03:54:48.189 --> 03:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that we are a tribe that
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
makes us fall under title 25 so Indian
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
is defined and it is Indian not Native
 
03:54:56.670 --> 03:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
American is defined under title 25 as a
 
03:54:59.309 --> 03:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
member of a tribe and tribe is defined
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
under title 25 as um an political entity
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
that is recognized by a government and
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
then there's and most of what title 25
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to is federal recognition so
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's government to government at the
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
federal level State recognition is a
 
03:55:18.750 --> 03:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
state recognizes a
 
03:55:22.550 --> 03:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
tribe that gives that tribe government
 
03:55:24.670 --> 03:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
state to government relationships with
 
03:55:27.070 --> 03:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
the state that recognizes it but it also
 
03:55:29.309 --> 03:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
makes it a political entity with certain
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
rights so the right to sell my baskets
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is protected because I
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
am enrolled in a recognized tribe it
 
03:55:39.070 --> 03:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what state recognized it
 
03:55:41.229 --> 03:55:41.239 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire departments have said
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
to me in the past when I've tried to
 
03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
talk to them our tribe has an agreement
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
with the federal government that we can
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
carry bird Parts eagle feathers or other
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
migratory bird parts now that's not a
 
03:55:55.070 --> 03:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
right that the general citizens have but
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
because we're enrolled in a political
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
entity we have that agreement so I
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to meet with fishing game just to
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were all on the same
 
03:56:05.710 --> 03:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
page to avoid any misunderstandings if
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
tribal members are seen with um with
 
03:56:10.269 --> 03:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
bird feathers and the response was New
 
03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't recognize any tribes
 
03:56:14.469 --> 03:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
so that's why we'd like to start that
 
03:56:16.590 --> 03:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
discussion we hope in the future that
 
03:56:19.309 --> 03:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is ready that now will be
 
03:56:21.910 --> 03:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
the time to recognize tribes but in it's
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
the details of tribal recognition in New
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are outside the scope of this
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill just the
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
concept uh another followup thank you
 
03:56:34.590 --> 03:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
very much um so to make sure that I'm
 
03:56:36.910 --> 03:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
fully who is sitting on the commission
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
currently um I think some of them are
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
here they can better speak to who they
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
are great thank you so much I do have um
 
03:56:46.189 --> 03:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
this I can pass out they may pass it out
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's just a copy of the
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
website for the commission on Native
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
Affairs it shows who's appointed and um
 
03:56:57.070 --> 03:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
and there are currently five empty seats
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
and so we did do some work last year to
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
fix the quum issue but there were other
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
parts where like I said they had wanted
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
to remove reference to the federal law
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
from the bill and we didn't the that did
 
03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:12.439 align:start position:0%
not pass thank you so much um thank you
 
03:57:15.750 --> 03:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
given that this is about recognition and
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
only abanaki who have ties to Vermont
 
03:57:21.790 --> 03:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
can be recognized in the recognized by
 
03:57:25.229 --> 03:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont abanaki uh do you think that
 
03:57:27.750 --> 03:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
there may be some potential to also
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
include those um who would be able to be
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
a member after the state of New
 
03:57:36.030 --> 03:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recognizes the ab yes that's
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
been our hope and our prayer and our
 
03:57:40.110 --> 03:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
goal from day one is that New Hampshire
 
03:57:42.910 --> 03:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
would provide a path for all groups who
 
03:57:45.550 --> 03:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria whatever that winds up
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
being and yes that this would get
 
03:57:49.870 --> 03:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
revised and I almost see this like an
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
inter measure as we get that process set
 
03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
up because my sense is really and
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
sincerely that there is a will to
 
03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
recognize the abanaki that these old
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
fears you know some of the fears you
 
03:58:03.349 --> 03:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
heard me read in those excerpts came
 
03:58:06.429 --> 03:58:06.439 align:start position:0%
from 2008 I think that the commission's
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
done a a good job in just this hearing
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
the bills and and me having lunch blah
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
blah blah for two years with people
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
people has um really helped people to
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
understand that the abanaki are here we
 
03:58:21.870 --> 03:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
always have been here and uh and I think
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
the state's ready to do this and I would
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
love to see every group in New Hampshire
 
03:58:27.910 --> 03:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
become recognized that wants to they
 
03:58:30.269 --> 03:58:30.279 align:start position:0%
don't all want to and so as a followup
 
03:58:31.870 --> 03:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
then there are other groups as well who
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't have recognition correct in both
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire correct thank
 
03:58:38.910 --> 03:58:38.920 align:start position:0%

03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%

South Berwick and North
 
03:59:32.030 --> 03:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
Berwick I'm here to oppose this bill as
 
03:59:34.229 --> 03:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
it allows other state and federally
 
03:59:36.750 --> 03:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
recognized tribal members to nominate
 
03:59:38.429 --> 03:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
individuals to this
 
03:59:40.950 --> 03:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
commission the proposed Bill does not
 
03:59:43.229 --> 03:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
address other tribal entities that exist
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
nor Define what the process would be to
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
recognize others if this bill were to be
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
enacted the process today is simple one
 
03:59:57.429 --> 03:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
application three references and the
 
03:59:57.439 --> 03:59:59.030 align:start position:0%
application three references and the
governor

03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
approves the desire for state recognized
 
04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
tribes is one that I absolutely share
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
however there are better ways to achieve
 
04:00:12.349 --> 04:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
this goal collaboration conversation
 
04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
Community then make a recommendation to
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
the general
 
04:00:19.110 --> 04:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
court these are the ways that we move
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
forward towards State recognition
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
finally for the abanaki people thank you
 
04:00:28.030 --> 04:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh my question is um your
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
tribe is not recognized by the state of
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do you currently have the
 
04:00:37.469 --> 04:00:37.479 align:start position:0%
ability to be on the council um and
 
04:00:39.670 --> 04:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
would this remove that ability as it's
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
currently drafted yes ma'am I am
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%

as a followup if you could re if you
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
could let me know what specifically
 
04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
would be needed in order to preserve
 
04:00:57.070 --> 04:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
your access to serving on the council
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
while recognizing all of the challenges
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
around recognition I'd greatly
 
04:01:02.990 --> 04:01:03.000 align:start position:0%

today my name name is Melinda Sims and

I'm speaking in opposition to HB
 
04:01:53.070 --> 04:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
161 um thank you for this opportunity I
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
stand in strong opposition to House Bill
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
161 as it undermines New Hampshire's
 
04:02:02.830 --> 04:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
governmental Authority and creates an
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
unprecedented transfer of power to outof
 
04:02:08.750 --> 04:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
State entities this bill removes the
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
governor's appointment appointment
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
Authority a fundamental executive
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
function recognized by the New Hampshire
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution and instead empowers the
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House along with tribal
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
Chiefs many from Vermont to control
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%

commission the proposed legislation
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
specifies that Vermont abanaki tribes
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
and other New England tribes can
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
nominate commission members according to
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
the National Conference of State
 
04:02:43.229 --> 04:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
legislatures no other state allows
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
external entities from different states
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
to control membership of their
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
government bodies this creates a
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedence where New
 
04:02:55.389 --> 04:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's governmental Affairs become
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
subject to outside influence furthermore
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
04:03:05.309 --> 04:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
consistently held that state commissions
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
must remain accountable to New
 
04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's elected officials to ensure
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
proper oversight and represent ation of
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
our citizens interests the proposed
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
structure eliminates this essential
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
checks and
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
balances the current commission
 
04:03:28.590 --> 04:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
structure while not perfect maintains
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
proper accountability to New Hampshire's
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
governance system while still ensuring
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
Native American
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
representation if reforms are needed
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
they should preserve New Hampshire's
 
04:03:43.080 --> 04:03:44.590 align:start position:0%
they should preserve New Hampshire's
sovereignity

04:03:44.590 --> 04:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
sovereignity
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
rather than seeding control to external
 
04:03:52.110 --> 04:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
entities I urge this committee to reject
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
hb1 161 and protect New Hampshire's
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority to govern its
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
own commissions the basic principles
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire government B should
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
be accountable to New Hampshire elected
 
04:04:12.910 --> 04:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
officials is not a partisan issue it's a
 
04:04:12.920 --> 04:04:14.269 align:start position:0%
officials is not a partisan issue it's a
foundation

04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
04:04:17.790 --> 04:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
governance principle that transcends
 
04:04:17.800 --> 04:04:19.189 align:start position:0%
governance principle that transcends

04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%

04:04:42.790 --> 04:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
members of the commission who are I'm
 
04:04:45.630 --> 04:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
here on my own
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
behalf I follow up yes follow up so are
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
you aware of whether the commission is
 
04:04:54.750 --> 04:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
aware that that this bill is being heard
 
04:04:56.189 --> 04:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
today we have somebody else from the
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
commission what we have somebody else to
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
speak I'm asking her whether she knows I
 
04:05:05.550 --> 04:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
have a card yes can I ask her for an
 
04:05:07.710 --> 04:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
answer I'll allow you to continue with
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
that but when we have the cards and we
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
know who's already speaking we we don't
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
need to ask them okay h defer my
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
question for the moment thank you since
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
you kind of have answered it thank you
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
SL uh thank you why in your opinion are
 
04:05:28.469 --> 04:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
there five open seats on the
 
04:05:32.309 --> 04:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
commission well they uh were in
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
transition and getting um members on
 
04:05:37.080 --> 04:05:38.469 align:start position:0%
transition and getting um members on
board

04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
so I mean just like any other committee
 
04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's always open seats and so they're
 
04:05:49.630 --> 04:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
they're going through the process of of
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh interviewing people and getting them
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
on board now I know in the past it's
 
04:05:55.630 --> 04:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
been kind of
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
challenging um getting people on because
 
04:06:00.429 --> 04:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
it takes so many months to get it
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
through the system to be approved so uh
 
04:06:07.870 --> 04:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
when you've got five seats and it's
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
taking three to four months a piece it
 
04:06:13.830 --> 04:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
takes a little bit of time but I do know
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
that there are people that have applied
 
04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh they're going through that
 
04:06:21.750 --> 04:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
process thank you followup and just to
 
04:06:24.030 --> 04:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
clarify these are Rec recent vacancies
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
then that I think you would need to ask
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh the PE the uh Chief and others on
 
04:06:34.349 --> 04:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
that board thank you thank you thank you
 
04:06:36.990 --> 04:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative D thank you madam chair
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
so I remain confused um which is not
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
unusual the my question has to do with
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
is your opposition
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
related to the fact that it's somebody
 
04:06:48.790 --> 04:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
who doesn't reside in New Hampshire
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
who's making the nominations and the
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
reason that I'm what I'm trying to wrap
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
my head around is I could understand the
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
opposition well I could understand
 
04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully a lot of things but I I would
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
understand if the opposition were to say
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
for example the governor of Vermont
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
making a
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
nomination but where the nomination is
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
coming from that I believe it says in
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
here but I um nominated by the chiefs of
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the state recognized abanaki or
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
federally recognized tribes the
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
nominations would be coming from the
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
tribes just perhaps by people that don't
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
live they don't reside in New Hampshire
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
but the people who are nominated do
 
04:07:28.109 --> 04:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
reside in New Hampshire can you clarify
 
04:07:30.510 --> 04:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
for me do you understand what I'm I'm
 
04:07:31.950 --> 04:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
not very articulate do you understand
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying which is I could
 
04:07:35.229 --> 04:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
understand if it were like coming from
 
04:07:38.109 --> 04:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the governor of Vermont as
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to um the the tribal Chief in
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont who also possibly represents
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
people of the same Indian tribe in New
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well because of that
 
04:07:50.429 --> 04:07:50.439 align:start position:0%
historic relationship thank you Sor let
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
me see if I'm understanding your your
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
question correctly are you asking me why
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
as a Native American I am not allowing
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
another Native American tribe in on on
 
04:08:08.109 --> 04:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
here from from Vermont or or no no no my
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
goodness okay I'm sorry oh I I think I
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
think was the question that you think
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
that it is um a lack of accountability
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire to have
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not from New Hampshire
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
making nominations to the commission is
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
that way you were asking her it's sort
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
sort of sort of what what I'm trying to
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
understand what the objection is and I
 
04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting it's a lack of
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
accountability or what the concern is
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
but is it is it that there somebody who
 
04:08:39.149 --> 04:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
is residing outside of New Hampshire who
 
04:08:40.990 --> 04:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
is making that nomination even if
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
nominally representing people who live
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Hampshire but we are
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
not recognizing but Vermont is thank you
 
04:08:50.269 --> 04:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
for your question I can only speak for
 
04:08:50.279 --> 04:08:51.710 align:start position:0%
for your question I can only speak for
myself

04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:08:54.990 --> 04:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
personally um I don't want someone from
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
another state coming in and telling me
 
04:09:03.309 --> 04:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
how to um live in this state and so I
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
have that objection but I also have
 
04:09:05.439 --> 04:09:06.309 align:start position:0%
have that objection but I also have
other

04:09:06.309 --> 04:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
objections um there is a question as to
 
04:09:10.960 --> 04:09:11.910 align:start position:0%
objections um there is a question as to
the

04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:09:15.389 --> 04:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
genealogy um the question I have
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
personally is it the person that States
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
they're a genealogist are they an
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
actually certified genealogist through
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
the board of
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
genealogy um or were they just made that
 
04:09:33.070 --> 04:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
position because they have a degree or
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge of History so what is their
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
actual certification so I have a lot of
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions and until those are answered I
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
I kind
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
accept someone coming in and from
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
another state and then trying to take
 
04:09:49.159 --> 04:09:50.750 align:start position:0%
another state and then trying to take
over

04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
and that's thank you thank you other
 
04:09:56.670 --> 04:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I do have
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
04:10:00.750 --> 04:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
Bailey I I guess I'm somewhat confused
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
too um we've heard that this uh a tribal
 
04:10:06.910 --> 04:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
group that
 
04:10:10.469 --> 04:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
had historically was in Vermont New
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we've heard this morning
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
even into Maine
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
and there seems to be Vermont
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
recognition and an overall Federal
 
04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
recognition but New Hampshire seems to
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
be missing and evidently Maine is
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
missing too um is this intended to
 
04:10:28.830 --> 04:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
supply the New Hampshire piece um thank
 
04:10:31.109 --> 04:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
you I think that is sort of where this
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
is looking to head I I do have to say
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
that as somebody who um ancestor sent
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
her daughter to go hide in the bushes
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
when they were coming around to do a
 
04:10:41.950 --> 04:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
headcount and and list people for the
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
registry after being marched from the
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
Carolinas to Oklahoma um I have
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to the genealogy and all the
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
details that go in with Indian law
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm not I can't qualify as a
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
member of the tribe because of that um
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
and I recognize how complex this is I'm
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
really thankful to get all of these
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
details about specific challenges and
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that we'll be able to
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
continue the dialogue if this is
 
04:11:06.189 --> 04:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
something that moves forward so that we
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
can understand the way to do it
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
correctly because it is so complex
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
between federal law um tribe tradition
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then law for the recognition I think
 
04:11:17.309 --> 04:11:17.319 align:start position:0%
the abanaki are in a really difficult
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
position because they are recognized by
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont and those who don't have family
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
ties to Vermont can't be recognized so
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
therefore they can't sell the
 
04:11:30.189 --> 04:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
abanaki um crafts so this it's something
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to figure out how
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with but we need to make sure we
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't make things worse in the process
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that a good understanding of the
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
challenges we're facing it is a very
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
good understanding but there is another
 
04:11:43.469 --> 04:11:43.479 align:start position:0%
part of the puzzle is there's a a
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
question as to the genealogy and the
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
authenticity of Vermont and so odino has
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
they're they've been doing a a large
 
04:12:00.510 --> 04:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
study and they've gone to um the United
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
Nations about it and and so on so
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of parts this puzzle that
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at first before
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
someone just comes in and takes over a
 
04:12:12.800 --> 04:12:13.870 align:start position:0%
someone just comes in and takes over a
board

04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:12:16.030 --> 04:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
so so my my description was just simply
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
scratching the surface so this is
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
complex and deep so thank you thank
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's no other questions from the
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate your testimony
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%

04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
changing the membership of the New
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%

meeting the New Hampshire Commission on
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs consulted about
 
04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed hb1 161
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
discussed its ramifications for the
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
Native American people of many tribes in
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
addition to the
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
abanaki who are residents of New
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at the conclusion of this
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
consultation and by unanimous roll call
 
04:13:58.510 --> 04:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
vote the New Hampshire Commission on
 
04:14:00.429 --> 04:14:00.439 align:start position:0%
Native American Affairs decided to
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
request that this committee not pass HB
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
616 hb1 161 as currently written due to
 
04:14:10.590 --> 04:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
the following
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
reasons one New Hampshire commit
 
04:14:15.309 --> 04:14:15.319 align:start position:0%
on Native American Affairs is very
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
concerned that for three consecutive
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
years now legislation regarding or
 
04:14:21.790 --> 04:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
mentioning the New Hampshire Commission
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
on the Native American Affairs has been
 
04:14:26.830 --> 04:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
proposed to the legisl New Hampshire
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
legislature without the authors of this
 
04:14:32.149 --> 04:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill ever having consulted with the
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
commission or even having notified the
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
commission that the bill a bill that
 
04:14:39.070 --> 04:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
would impact the abanaki and other
 
04:14:40.510 --> 04:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
Native American residents of New
 
04:14:43.030 --> 04:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was being written it is
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
troubling that the commission has been
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
and continues to be marginalized in This
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
Way New Hampshire has a relatively small
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
Native American population however we
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
are certain that New Hampshire
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
government agrees that the specialized
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
needs of its Native American residents
 
04:15:04.269 --> 04:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
are unique and must be addressed at
 
04:15:07.870 --> 04:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
present New Hampshire has no federally
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
or state recognized tribes or chiefs
 
04:15:14.109 --> 04:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
therefore the commission was created to
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
advocate for and heighten the public
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
awareness of the abanaki and other
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
Native American residents of our of New
 
04:15:23.469 --> 04:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however if
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
HB 161 is passed as written New
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire indigenous reg residents will
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
have no choice no voice or
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%

04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
language of hb1 161 as proposed
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
relinquishes decision-making regarding

assignment five furthermore hb1 161
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
proposes action and oversight that the

are associated with the federal law such

commission jurisdiction as implied in
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
the current wording of the hb1 161 we
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
have additional concerns about the
 
04:17:57.950 --> 04:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
wording of the hb1 161 and the ways in
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
which this bill Pro processes to the
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%

this statement that there the enumerates
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
in this statement are the ones we see to
 
04:18:17.109 --> 04:18:17.119 align:start position:0%
be the most pressing we ask that the
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee find this bill expedient in
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%

Hampshire that are not part of a

the board we are not restricting fed
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
recognized matter of fact I think we
 
04:19:15.199 --> 04:19:16.550 align:start position:0%
recognized matter of fact I think we
have

04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
one Christine isn't she I don't know we
 
04:19:23.149 --> 04:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
have uh um a lady from the Midwest who
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
lives here and she is on there and I
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
believe she's Navajo I believe I'm not
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
really I don't really care you show up
 
04:19:32.070 --> 04:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:19:34.990 --> 04:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
person anyways and I'm and she's she
 
04:19:38.349 --> 04:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
grew up on a reservation so we do have a
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
federally recognized person um
 
04:19:46.269 --> 04:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
I think she's the only one maybe maybe
 
04:19:49.469 --> 04:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
one or two more but the thing is is
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
that we our biggest frustration I asked
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
to be on this commission to help find
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
the indigenous people recognition Okay
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
to Aid in our culture to Aid in teaching
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
just to be recognized that we are here
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I have spent the last three years
 
04:20:13.870 --> 04:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and not even being
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
able to have time because we are
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
volunteers we travel some of us travel
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
two to three hours to sit we finally
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
have gotten uh the the ability to have
 
04:20:29.309 --> 04:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
half you know somebody lives too far
 
04:20:31.830 --> 04:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
away or a sick child or whatever to be
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
able to video in but that took us two
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
and a half years to do that we are
 
04:20:39.269 --> 04:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
running against legislation to stop us
 
04:20:41.389 --> 04:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
from doing what we need to do if
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
somebody lives in New Hamp Hampshire who
 
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
is federally recognized tribe that lives
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%

04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
commission sorry followup thank you very
 
04:21:03.630 --> 04:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair does the the way that
 
04:21:05.469 --> 04:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
it's written currently and the current
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
constitution of the commission however
 
04:21:10.510 --> 04:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
does that leave people out who reside in
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are members of the
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
abanaki tribe from applying currently to
 
04:21:18.189 --> 04:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
be on the commission by the governor's
 
04:21:20.070 --> 04:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
appointment right they have to go
 
04:21:21.910 --> 04:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
through the governor they need a letter
 
04:21:24.189 --> 04:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
of recommendation from their Chief or
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
from an indigenous Chief person three
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
letters of recommendation and one
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
Written Letter and it's submitted to the
 
04:21:34.269 --> 04:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
governor now our last Governor was way
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
slow in responding to those things uh
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
from my information which is hearsay so
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
don't put it gospel we have people that
 
04:21:45.149 --> 04:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
have signed up and asked and have sent
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
in all their requirements but have not
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
been approved or
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
unapproved thank
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
you very fast thank you so so there's
 
04:21:57.309 --> 04:21:57.319 align:start position:0%
nobody what I'm hearing is that there's
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
nobody who's part of the AV and I can
 
04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
tribe or the there's nobody in New
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the current system who
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
is ex who is being excluded from service
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
correct is that correct okay corre thank
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
you so much correct I think the only
 
04:22:11.070 --> 04:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
exclusion is maybe you're in jail I
 
04:22:15.389 --> 04:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
don't know you know but even then it um
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
it I don't think it has anything to do
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
with with um recognition it's all to do
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
with what you want to do and support
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience you're
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:22:29.229 --> 04:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
Lae yeah I I wanted to give you an
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to answer my previous
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
question which was um why why are there
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
five vacancies in your opinion um
 
04:22:40.590 --> 04:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
because there are um we have no control
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
over who gets approved and who doesn't
 
04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
that all goes to the governor and right
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
now we have a brand new governor and she
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
is probably so swamped she doesn't even
 
04:22:53.149 --> 04:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
know the color of her toenail polish so
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
we need to you know bear with her but we
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
have had five openings I know for a fact
 
04:22:59.149 --> 04:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
two people have applied and have not
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
heard anything for over a year um you
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
know one way or the other so it's it's a
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
process that needs to be maybe sped up a
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
little bit and brought to light but it's
 
04:23:14.229 --> 04:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
also the wheels turn slowly um we have
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
been you know up until we could do uh
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
the video conferencing and vote we had
 
04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
to have 12 representatives there and
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
often times we would have 11 and the
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
12th one would have a flat tire and we
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
04:23:33.630 --> 04:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
cancel that it was our biggest stumbling
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
block we cannot I mean the uh 2024 we
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
had one meeting and the only reason we
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
got that meeting in between between
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
sickness and snowstorms and every
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
everything else availability we only
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
able to get that one meeting in because
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
of that and we got it in and we were
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
voted so that we had to get all 12
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
members together to vote that we would
 
04:24:02.710 --> 04:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
accept and we could have video
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
conferencing you know those things
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
really hold us up and we were the only
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
commission that I know of that had to
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
that couldn't do this or that couldn't
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
have had to have all 12 members you know
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
we had a minimum of 12 and guess how
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
many members we had 12 so thank you I I
 
04:24:22.590 --> 04:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
think we get the the problem of no

04:24:27.389 --> 04:24:27.399 align:start position:0%

reflecting what's going on here today um
 
04:26:05.630 --> 04:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
I also was one of the founding members
 
04:26:09.309 --> 04:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
of the Commission in 2010 I was on there
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
briefly um over time
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
I should probably pipe up I did serve on
 
04:26:17.950 --> 04:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
the commission for six years um five of
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
them were as Vice chair um and I just
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
rotated off about a year ago hence one
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
of the vacant seats and for all Clarity
 
04:26:29.070 --> 04:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
I am now the chair of the commission I
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
was uh and as uh you've heard the
 
04:26:35.670 --> 04:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
nomination process and the selection
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
process is very lengthy I put my name in
 
04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
almost a year in advance uh and it took
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
and I love Chris anunu but it took
 
04:26:46.590 --> 04:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
forever to get through before I got
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
finally nominated and put in place and
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh during our last meeting which was
 
04:26:53.670 --> 04:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
very successful which we had a meeting
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday I sat as the chair for the
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
first time presiding over the uh
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
commission commission went very well it
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
was well received we had public there
 
04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
and we had full
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
representation I see that uh our
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
director of the Department of cultural
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
and natural and cultural resources are
 
04:27:17.070 --> 04:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
here I've asked him to be here to
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
explain the nomination process and how
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
the selection process because this has
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
been out in the air in a lot of rumors
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
that there was a nominating committee
 
04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
within the commission this was true when
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative G was a chair but that
 
04:27:36.750 --> 04:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
was eliminated and the process was
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
strictly through the proper channels of
 
04:27:42.990 --> 04:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and those letters would be
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
directed to Ben Wilson who is in the
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
audience today who can explain this and
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
they were vetted and looked at and you
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
know selected to be going forward to the
 
04:27:55.590 --> 04:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
governor we had no control over this I
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
had no control over my appointment
 
04:27:59.790 --> 04:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
either until I went into Chris and said
 
04:28:02.189 --> 04:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're running short we need to get
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
some of these appointments through so
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're all aware of the commission you
 
04:28:07.710 --> 04:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
know appointment process
 
04:28:10.269 --> 04:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
problems what's more interesting to us
 
04:28:12.109 --> 04:28:12.119 align:start position:0%
is the way this was worded in a specific
 
04:28:12.119 --> 04:28:13.189 align:start position:0%
is the way this was worded in a specific
specific

04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
ways you know you heard a lot about
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
title 25
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
law we're talking about neight here with
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
title 25 law our tribe uh filed for
 
04:28:27.389 --> 04:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
federal acknowledgment in
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
1995 and in spite of the fact that
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
vermonts keep on saying we never filed
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
for a petition we are 151 on the federal
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
Bia list there's over 600 tribes there
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
very difficult to find who's applied but
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
we applied at the same time that the
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
missc group in Vermont applied they went
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
through the process enforced the federal
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
recognition and were denied and they
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
went on an appeal and got denied again
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's two strikes are out in the federal
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
system also there's a misconception
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
about State versus uh Federal recognized
 
04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
tribes versus title 25 tribes when you
 
04:29:07.710 --> 04:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
petition the federal government you put
 
04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
your foot in the door and you're
 
04:29:11.070 --> 04:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
protected under a clause called
 
04:29:11.080 --> 04:29:12.870 align:start position:0%
protected under a clause called
self-determination

04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
04:29:15.630 --> 04:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
it's well in the documents that tribes
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
and communities can go under the
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
self-declared Avenue because only
 
04:29:22.670 --> 04:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
legislature the federal legislature can
 
04:29:25.309 --> 04:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
actually create or deny a tribe its
 
04:29:28.429 --> 04:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
status and that process is quite
 
04:29:30.550 --> 04:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
lengthy what I'm trying to get at is
 
04:29:32.229 --> 04:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
here we are
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
protected we have been working with the
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
federal government since 1990 in a lot
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
of capacity including the state which
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
seems to be totally ignored by this
 
04:29:44.309 --> 04:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislature we've been actively a
 
04:29:46.830 --> 04:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
community leader in this area for a long
 
04:29:49.030 --> 04:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
time and we're participating in the best
 
04:29:52.149 --> 04:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
we can but when we read this bill as
 
04:29:52.159 --> 04:29:54.389 align:start position:0%
we can but when we read this bill as
it's

04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:29:57.309 --> 04:29:57.319 align:start position:0%
written it seems to like it tears into
 
04:29:58.950 --> 04:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
the heart of the
 
04:30:02.229 --> 04:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
issue they really never liked the fact
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
that it was a diverse group when I was
 
04:30:06.630 --> 04:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the commission from the begin could
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
you please not make accusations about
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
people's uh Viewpoint or any of that
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
and just if you talk about the specific
 
04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
basics of it I think we have a pretty
 
04:30:16.830 --> 04:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
good understanding of some of the
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
challenges the challenges are that why
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
would we give up State sovereignty to
 
04:30:25.469 --> 04:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
allow any other entity no matter what it
 
04:30:28.349 --> 04:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
is any commission you just label any way
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
you want why would you go to some other
 
04:30:33.870 --> 04:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
agency National or Regional to get your
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
appointments filled that that's a
 
04:30:39.269 --> 04:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
strictly a very serious issue with the
 
04:30:42.670 --> 04:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
state we a live three here die and you
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
know everybody has a right of
 
04:30:47.790 --> 04:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
representation I'd like to see the
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
commission represent all the indigenous
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
population the state not just abnaki it
 
04:30:55.510 --> 04:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
was never the intent in 2010 that this
 
04:30:58.469 --> 04:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
was an abnaki organization This was
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
meant to represent everybody we have
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
Hawaiians we have alaskans here we can't
 
04:31:05.990 --> 04:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
force people to join the commission but
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
we don't deny them either we've never
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
Divi Divi you know denied them but when
 
04:31:12.790 --> 04:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
you read these these Clauses that are
 
04:31:15.630 --> 04:31:15.640 align:start position:0%
written here what line is it um so the
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill the bill um immediately starts off
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
by limiting the commission from a
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
current 15 member seat to seven members
 
04:31:26.590 --> 04:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
um the bill also removes art tourism and
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the department of cultural resources
 
04:31:30.349 --> 04:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
from the bill which also then in turn
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
removes All State oversight over the
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
commission it also limits the
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
commission's ability to access programs
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
and um other functions that are
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
available through um the state um uh
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
agencies um the membership um by naming
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
only state or federally recognized
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
tribes as naming um uh members on the
 
04:31:55.630 --> 04:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
commission actually violates title 25
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it actually um violates our legal
 
04:32:01.510 --> 04:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
rights as a petitioning tribe um passage
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill would um make it make it
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
possible that we could sue the state for
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
representation um the bill um removes
 
04:32:11.469 --> 04:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
the layers of vetting through the
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
department of cultural and natural
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
resources as well as the governor's
 
04:32:16.830 --> 04:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
office it removes the Governor from
 
04:32:17.950 --> 04:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
making the
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
appointments um and I actually had a
 
04:32:22.590 --> 04:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
question are there any other Commissions
 
04:32:24.429 --> 04:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
in the state where the house Speaker
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
makes the appointments and bypasses the
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
governor because I was unable to find
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
one but hopefully someone here would be
 
04:32:31.469 --> 04:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
able to correct me on that but that's
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
besides the point if you continue on the
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill bill um uh the
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
um I think you have a really good amount
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's laid out and in this written
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that wasn't even half of it
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm reading from my notes actually if
 
04:32:48.750 --> 04:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't mind emailing that to the
 
04:32:50.670 --> 04:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
committee I think that at this point
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
with the amount of information we need
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
to keep skimming on the top of the
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
surface because that's what we're going
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to understand all of this
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
additional supporting information be
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
very helpful for us all right um I'd be
 
04:33:02.950 --> 04:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
happy to send um the um acknowledgement
 
04:33:04.269 --> 04:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
from the federal government for our
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
Petition of you know for a filing
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
petition as well and hopefully we can
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
put that to rest because this is the
 
04:33:12.109 --> 04:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
third year um we've had to testify on
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
that and I've supplied evidence um on
 
04:33:16.269 --> 04:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
the prior two years as well okay thank
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to wrap up that you know a
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
lot of these things that were in here
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
statutory things from uh title 25 those
 
04:33:27.150 --> 04:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
vermonts already have those rights
 
04:33:28.551 --> 04:33:28.561 align:start position:0%
ingrained in the fact that they got
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
State recognition they do not need
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
subordinate Authority here in New
 
04:33:35.070 --> 04:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do their arts and crafts
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's protected because they are
 
04:33:38.670 --> 04:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
already a state recognized tribe they
 
04:33:40.269 --> 04:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
don't need to have a secondary
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
recognition here their tribal members
 
04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
that reside here live under that
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
umbrella same thing for Eagle fevers
 
04:33:49.789 --> 04:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
child welfare cases we've handled child
 
04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
welfare cases since the 1990s when the
 
04:33:55.629 --> 04:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
law came out it's a tribe to government
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
relationship not a commission the
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
commission's never vetted for that and I
 
04:34:03.429 --> 04:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
I in respect to the fact that Ben Wilson
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
here if there's any questions about the
 
04:34:08.109 --> 04:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
nomination process he can explain it a
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
lot better and it takes us out of the
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
formula because you'll understand it's
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
it's not complicated it's
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's just time consuming
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you there any questions from the
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
committee representative syes and Men
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm something something that occurred
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
to me that has nothing to do with the
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
bill but has to do with this situation
 
04:34:31.390 --> 04:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
and that's if you're not federally or
 
04:34:33.709 --> 04:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
state recognized how do I know how does
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
anyone know that you're an abanaki or
 
04:34:37.470 --> 04:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
that you're a tribe or anything I you
 
04:34:37.480 --> 04:34:38.310 align:start position:0%
that you're a tribe or anything I you
can

04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
just what are your credentials for this
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
I I think I'll leave that as a
 
04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question because uh we're
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
already running significantly behind uh
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
but thank you it's very challenging
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer that for you later
 
04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes if you could if you could fill us in
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
on what what the questions you think we
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
asking with the whole committee would
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate to hear that um written later
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
on as a followup representative Schmid
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
well I certainly hope we're going to
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee because we're
 
04:35:06.670 --> 04:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
getting into all kinds of De details
 
04:35:09.070 --> 04:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
that are really not appropriate to try
 
04:35:12.551 --> 04:35:12.561 align:start position:0%
to thrash out in a hearing I thank you I
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
think the biggest part is we'll try and
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand if this is something where
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
even a subcommittee could emerge on the
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
other side with a successful bill or not
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
but we we will see and see the right
 
04:35:23.789 --> 04:35:23.799 align:start position:0%
process I think don't think that we'd be
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
making a vote without having a
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on this because it
 
04:35:30.429 --> 04:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
is very complex vote to move it forward
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
representative loding okay already
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
handled thank you I I think that if uh
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
if there's a movement to pass this we
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
will spend the time in order to dig into
 
04:35:40.590 --> 04:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
all of these details so thank you very
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much um in closing I
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
just want to suggest um uh UNH law does
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
have an indigenous law professor who's
 
04:35:50.830 --> 04:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
also a retired Federal um biia judge
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
which is Bureau of Indian Affairs judge
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
I would highly suggest that this
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
committee talks to these to these legal
 
04:35:59.551 --> 04:35:59.561 align:start position:0%
experts before you pass bills like this
 
04:36:02.429 --> 04:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you thank you next
 
04:36:10.029 --> 04:36:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
Stevens thank you for taking my
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll be very quick I am chief
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
Don Stevens of the nohan band of the
 
04:36:19.629 --> 04:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
kusak abanaki nation um a tribe that
 
04:36:21.310 --> 04:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
happens to be recognized by the state of
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont I am here to support our New
 
04:36:27.789 --> 04:36:27.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and I wanted to
 
04:36:30.390 --> 04:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
explain some of the confusion to kind of
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
put it in simple terms you all have your
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
own constituents you represent towns
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
within your
 
04:36:40.709 --> 04:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction being a federal state or
 
04:36:43.551 --> 04:36:43.561 align:start position:0%
non-recognized tribe you are the leader
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
you are the government and your
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to support those
 
04:36:49.470 --> 04:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
constituents underneath you and give
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
them a voice so we we have citizens I
 
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
have over a thousand citizens all over
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
our Western abanaki territory and
 
04:37:02.189 --> 04:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
several hundred here in the state of New
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we're running into is
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
that we're here as a government to
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
support the needs of our citizens just
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
like you're here to support the needs of
 
04:37:14.080 --> 04:37:14.949 align:start position:0%
like you're here to support the needs of
your

04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
constituents what we're asking for in
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is to have representation in
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in a commission because
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is what you set up as an Avenue to
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
speak from citizens with Native issues
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
to the government that is the commission
 
04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to represent all Native
 
04:37:34.910 --> 04:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
people they're supposed to support all
 
04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
the needs and state government right so
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
that's the Avenue that we have currently
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have had other citizens of ours
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
supply to the commission who have not
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
made it on for various reasons so our
 
04:37:49.551 --> 04:37:49.561 align:start position:0%
voices is not represented so that's like
 
04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
saying a legislator who represents
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
Warner and all of a sudden that
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
legislator is not allowed to be involved
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
in any policy making decisions that
 
04:38:00.429 --> 04:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
means that Warner is never going to have
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
representation their voices are never
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
going to be heard they're not going to
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
have their they're not going to support
 
04:38:07.629 --> 04:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
their constituents so we're not asking
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
to suppress anybody in New Hampshire
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
we're not asking to suppress that what
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're asking for is to have a voice
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
within the state government to represent
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
our needs and as a chief I have people
 
04:38:22.510 --> 04:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
from Lincoln Warner
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
Lancaster um K it um and if I need to
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
represent all of their needs so if you
 
04:38:31.670 --> 04:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
have one person that's not speaking to
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
the tribe how do they know what people
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
in Lancaster need how do they know what
 
04:38:37.470 --> 04:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
people in Warner need how do they know
 
04:38:40.029 --> 04:38:40.039 align:start position:0%
what people in Kentuck it so my role in
 
04:38:41.949 --> 04:38:41.959 align:start position:0%
our tribal Chief and our
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
is to communicate with us to say
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
communicate with us so we can know what
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
all of those citizens in all those
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions need so you're
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
representing our needs in New Hampshire
 
04:38:54.349 --> 04:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
the best way you can we don't want to
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
take over New Hampshire it's not our
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
role we're here to support the longevity
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
of all the citizens who have been here
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
who are going to sit on that board no
 
04:39:04.269 --> 04:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
verm moners are going to sit on the
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
board all we're doing is saying is that
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
the right person to represent all of our
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and we put those
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
names forward and then whoever decides
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
um to pick them or not that's up to you
 
04:39:19.470 --> 04:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
guys that's your government to decide
 
04:39:21.789 --> 04:39:21.799 align:start position:0%
who could sit on that commission but our
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
involvement is to say who is the best
 
04:39:25.470 --> 04:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
person to represent all of our people in
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we are have a
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility to all those people um we
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
had this problem in Vermont with the
 
04:39:34.990 --> 04:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
commission that there were people that
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
were on that commission that were either
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
stonewalling um they wouldn't let other
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
people be on that commission for
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason um because they felt
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
threatened or so in 2010 the entire
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
commission was wiped out and then the
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
the law was passed to allow every tribe
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's in new hampsh uh Vermont to have
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
a voice so they could speak for their
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
people so they were always represented
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
in state government and state policy so
 
04:40:04.750 --> 04:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
that is what was trying to be done here
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
is that we are not excluded and those
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people that I represent in
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have a voice and can speak
 
04:40:14.190 --> 04:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
right now none of my citizens are on the
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
commission we've had three applicants
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
and none of them have got on we have no
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
voice in New Hampshire so what we have
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
to do as a government is go around the
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
commission and work with different state
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
agencies I have a I have a bison herd in
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
sted our New Hampshire uh we have we
 
04:40:31.390 --> 04:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
have a food shelf in Kentuck it we have
 
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
maple syrup operations we are in New
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are not a state Vermont
 
04:40:39.270 --> 04:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
state tribe we are a tribe that happens
 
04:40:41.948 --> 04:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
to be recognized by the state of Vermont
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
and we do have federal legal agreements
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
with the Department of interior not for
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
Bia purposes but we do have agreements
 
04:40:51.030 --> 04:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
with the the federal government so I'm
 
04:40:52.670 --> 04:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions because
 
04:40:54.190 --> 04:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with this I've been
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
Chief since 2010 and I'm pretty involved
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
with all of the political aspects of all
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
of the people and all the states that we
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
represent um I'm going to ask a question
 
04:41:08.830 --> 04:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
before I recognize help it does okay um
 
04:41:12.110 --> 04:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
given that you represent a ter territory
 
04:41:14.590 --> 04:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't coincide with all the state
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
boundaries would it violate your
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
recognition within the state of Vermont
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
for you to name a a sort of a sub
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
subtribe or a regional tribe within the
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
land of New Hampshire and have a chief
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
that represents those people that reside
 
04:41:33.070 --> 04:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire that then would be
 
04:41:34.990 --> 04:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
able to better serve as a voice and an
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
Outreach and a and a liaison between
 
04:41:40.110 --> 04:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
those New Hampshire residents that are
 
04:41:42.310 --> 04:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
part of your tribe and the count and the
 
04:41:46.270 --> 04:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
commission well I don't you you are a
 
04:41:46.280 --> 04:41:48.030 align:start position:0%
commission well I don't you you are a
tribe

04:41:48.030 --> 04:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
tribe
 
04:41:51.070 --> 04:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
who is recognized like we in Statue we
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
the nohan band of the kusak abanaki
 
04:41:56.590 --> 04:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
nation that is our tribal name do can we
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
can we have representatives in each
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
state yes that's why you see Sher uh
 
04:42:04.270 --> 04:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
here Daryl or other people we're not
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
down here speaking to you they are um
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that are dealing with
 
04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because they are also New
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens I'm here as a support
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
structure so we could ask someone to be
 
04:42:17.230 --> 04:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
like if you know
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
history we were family bands so you had
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
families that traveled throughout New
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Vermont Massachusetts
 
04:42:24.990 --> 04:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
including mine who's tied to the
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
Phillips Grant up in uh up in the
 
04:42:28.948 --> 04:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
Northeast Kingdom before Vermont was a
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
state I mean that that deed is filed in
 
04:42:34.510 --> 04:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
L in New Hampshire um and our people are
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
are um tied to that even through our
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
recognition process in Vermont so the
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is yes we do
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
have other people
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
representing people in that area because
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
we can't do everything and they live
 
04:42:51.990 --> 04:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
here they know the the they know
 
04:42:54.150 --> 04:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
everything that's happening here I'm I'm
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
two hours away so I work with them so I
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question that is
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
helpful because knowing whether that
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
would violate your conditions with h
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont that's good to know no because
 
04:43:05.550 --> 04:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
we were recognized by Vermont but each
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
state is Sovereign and each state can
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
recognize who they want perfect so and
 
04:43:10.830 --> 04:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
there are tribes that are recognized
 
04:43:12.868 --> 04:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
mult mulle States just so people know
 
04:43:15.310 --> 04:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a either or there I mean you're
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
just acknowledging the fact that we're
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
operating here and we are a tribe here
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's not going to VI that's separate and
 
04:43:22.590 --> 04:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
Sovereign from Vermont you don't deal
 
04:43:24.030 --> 04:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
with Vermont politics they don't deal
 
04:43:26.110 --> 04:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
with yours thank you y uh representative
 
04:43:29.948 --> 04:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
slot J thank you madam chair um one of
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that this bill may have is
 
04:43:34.510 --> 04:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
that it has a sort of a totalizing
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
effect on the membership of the board
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues that the previous
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
speakers had brought up is that existing
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
committee members or existing commission
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
members would be removed uh if these uh
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
if these new rules took effect and I'm
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
curious as to whether or not you would
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
object to instead of all seats being uh
 
04:43:57.070 --> 04:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
required to be uh members of a
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
recognized tribe if we gave you five
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
seats say yeah I have no problem with we
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to stifle any voices we don't
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
want to stifle theirs we don't want to
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
style any we want a voice so my point
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
being is whether you amend the bill to
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
saying okay tribe has a voice on this
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
commission and you get a seat and then
 
04:44:17.390 --> 04:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
you submit a bunch of names and whoever
 
04:44:19.708 --> 04:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
in your committee decides or whoever
 
04:44:22.350 --> 04:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
decides who those which person or two
 
04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
that might be that's fine with me um as
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
long as we have a voice it's that what's
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
happening right now is we don't have a
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
voice and since we are a recognized
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
tribe under the law in statute we want a
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
voice because this is our traditional
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
Homeland as well but we're not speaking
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
for the other tribes we that's up to
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
them to speak for themselves we don't
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
want to exclude them we just don't want
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
to be excluded oursel because somebody
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
might be mad that we're have people in
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont and they're trying to say no
 
04:44:53.430 --> 04:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
they're Vermont so we're going to reject
 
04:44:54.990 --> 04:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
their application and then we have no
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
voice that's what's happening whether
 
04:44:59.310 --> 04:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
people are saying I have no control of
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
it or not we are being we had three
 
04:45:04.990 --> 04:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
applicants none of them were um included
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
and they had sat on the commission
 
04:45:08.910 --> 04:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
previously so it's not it's something's
 
04:45:10.830 --> 04:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
not right and it's broken and we need to
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
have a voice and that's all I'm asking
 
04:45:16.070 --> 04:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you followup yes do do you think
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
that that either denial or delay is a
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
result of the approval process going
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
through the governor's office or is
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
there some other uh I I don't know and I
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to speculate but I I have my
 
04:45:28.080 --> 04:45:29.030 align:start position:0%
don't want to speculate but I I have my
own

04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
theories um because they are vacant
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
seats and and we have three applicants
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
and none of them were forwarded to the
 
04:45:39.150 --> 04:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
governor's for for consideration so I
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
just want to say that um I can't
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
speculate I'm not going to all I know is
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm here to fix a broken process
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
and just like we did in Vermont is to
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
have a voice to continue our
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with the state of New
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you very much
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you for
 
04:45:59.868 --> 04:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so under current
 
04:46:02.030 --> 04:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
law do your tribal members in New
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already have an opportunity to
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
serve on this commission if they submit
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
an application under the current law I
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
believe there is um anybody I think in
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can serve I don't think
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's restricted but the problem is
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
there's something that's causing a
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
problem that we're not we're not getting
 
04:46:20.470 --> 04:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
on the commission and we're not having a
 
04:46:23.310 --> 04:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
voice but what we did in Vermont is that
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
because we are a recognized tribe and we
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
are have citizens in that
 
04:46:30.670 --> 04:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
constituency we wanted a guaranteed spot
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that way our voice would be heard
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
because if you just if you don't let our
 
04:46:38.270 --> 04:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
people on the commission then they're
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
speaking for our people
 
04:46:44.190 --> 04:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
without us being involved so that's like
 
04:46:45.670 --> 04:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
again it's like somebody speaking for
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
Warner and their and their their
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
representatives nowhere in the room and
 
04:46:51.310 --> 04:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
can't be found and that might not be
 
04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
what Warner wants so people are speaking
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
for us when we're not at the table so
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're asking for a seat that's all we're
 
04:47:02.030 --> 04:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
asking for is a seat at the table thank
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative sers thank
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so I'm just trying to
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
understand this a little bit better as
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
well so be real quick yep you said you
 
04:47:12.030 --> 04:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a voice on the commission
 
04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
here correct at this point does New
 
04:47:17.948 --> 04:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire abanaki have a voice in
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont we have no Hampshire people on
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
our tribe uh tribal board um if you're
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
asking do they have a voice in the
 
04:47:29.070 --> 04:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
commission they don't um because there's
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
no they don't have anybody from Vermont
 
04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's applied for they're not a
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
recognized tribe so they don't get a
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
guaranteed seat because the way Vermont
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
did it is that they guarant because you
 
04:47:43.708 --> 04:47:43.718 align:start position:0%
were a recognized tribe you had a seat
 
04:47:46.590 --> 04:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
at the table um but we do there is a
 
04:47:48.990 --> 04:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
there was a federal uh Native person
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
that was in on Vermont too because they
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
are a federally recognized tribe they
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
have citizens that live there too you
 
04:47:56.190 --> 04:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
probably have quite a few Federal uh
 
04:47:58.590 --> 04:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
citizens that might live here um but do
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
they have a voice um it's a luck of the
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
draw whether you get on the commission
 
04:48:05.788 --> 04:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
or not so if this is our Avenue to deal
 
04:48:07.590 --> 04:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire government if we
 
04:48:09.470 --> 04:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a voice we have to do it
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
outside of the Avenue news that you guys
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
created through the commission so that's
 
04:48:16.270 --> 04:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
why we have to be here and try to fix
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
this otherwise I'm going to come
 
04:48:19.708 --> 04:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
straight to you and avoid the commission
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't speak for me because
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
it's my responsibility to speak for my
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
people and if we don't have
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
representation on the commission then
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
then the you know that's that's what I'm
 
04:48:34.390 --> 04:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
saying I have to go outside of that
 
04:48:36.548 --> 04:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
Avenue so we're just trying to make the
 
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
process work so that way if that's the
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
process that native people have to do is
 
04:48:42.750 --> 04:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
go through the commission to speak to
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
the state government then we need a
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
voice thank you this is actually pretty
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
helpful because it helps us understand
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
why they're saying you're going around
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
and why there's the process we'll try
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
and figure out what's broken in that
 
04:48:54.708 --> 04:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
system right so even a simple amendment
 
04:48:58.270 --> 04:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
to add somebody else that you want to
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
have there is simple but just give us a
 
04:49:03.868 --> 04:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
voice thank you thank you very much and
 
04:49:05.670 --> 04:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
um the last card that I have is for
 
04:49:05.680 --> 04:49:07.788 align:start position:0%

Hampshire was a very similar attempt to
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
afford a vermont-based tribe power and
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
influence over New Hampshire State
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
policy and
 
04:51:16.110 --> 04:51:16.120 align:start position:0%

recognized by the state of
 
04:53:04.230 --> 04:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont which in my opinion is a backd
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
door way to bring the Vermont nohan into
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Indian Affairs the
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
spite the first approach last year well
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
the approach last year with HCR 7 that
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
failed please do not be fooled by this
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
veiled attempt of an outsider intrusion
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire State and tribal
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
sovereignty and if you could uh try and
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
not to give people's
 
04:53:36.750 --> 04:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
motives yep thank you doing my best
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
here there are no state recognized
 
04:53:40.750 --> 04:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
abanaki tribes in New Hampshire that I
 
04:53:42.750 --> 04:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
know of in fact as I understand it the
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
commission is charged was charged or
 
04:53:46.270 --> 04:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
should be charged with helping the state
 
04:53:48.270 --> 04:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
develop a process to
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%

Hampshire based tribes you heard this
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
which would effectively remove the
 
04:54:51.788 --> 04:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
current Commission on Native American
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%

would have no status no authority to be
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
on the this
 
04:55:13.708 --> 04:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
commission um furthermore it takes the
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
Sovereign power and right of the State
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to appoint it members
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
to its own commission on Native American
 
04:55:22.990 --> 04:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
Affairs and turns it over in part to a
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont base band of the abanaki who
 
04:55:27.390 --> 04:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
have repeatedly demonstrated and I'm
 
04:55:30.190 --> 04:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
sorry to say this they are not friends
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire could you could you
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
summarize because you will be sending
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
I think in
 
04:55:48.670 --> 04:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.070 --> 04:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
um there are in
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
fact many abanaki people here in two
 
04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
wellestablished tribes abanaki right
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
here who are willing and currently
 
04:56:04.510 --> 04:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
serving the people and the native people
 
04:56:07.548 --> 04:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
of the of the state and are open to the
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
commission the remedy that I heard here
 
04:56:13.788 --> 04:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
in I even heard it from Chief Stevens to
 
04:56:16.830 --> 04:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a place at least one place on the
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
commission for other tribes like in New
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like the nohan and let's not
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
forget there are three others the
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
misisco the elu and the K act there why
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
not have all of the abanaki people
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
tribes that are established have a place
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire commission that's a
 
04:56:37.948 --> 04:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
remedy that's a great remedy but let's
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
also see Chief step even stand up and
 
04:56:44.110 --> 04:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
fight for that same ability in Vermont
 
04:56:46.750 --> 04:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
it may not be the policy now but as we
 
04:56:48.390 --> 04:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
know laws are here and they can be
 
04:56:51.390 --> 04:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
changed so that should happen as well
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
because I can assure you just like Chief
 
04:56:55.708 --> 04:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
Stevens has people here in in New
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chief
 
04:57:01.948 --> 04:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
pulet and chief Paul from the New
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire bands have people in Vermont
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that so anyways
 
04:57:08.638 --> 04:57:11.110 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that so anyways
um

04:57:11.110 --> 04:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%

04:58:21.548 --> 04:58:21.558 align:start position:0%

chair of this committee to make sure
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm not making a big old hash out

that I'm not making a big old hash out
of

04:59:27.510 --> 04:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%

he's was able to come
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
back excuse me so I just passed out a
 
05:02:09.830 --> 05:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
copy of a recent New Hampshire Journal
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
iCal piece on this subject uh cac1 which
 
05:02:16.350 --> 05:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
is a measure establishing a lieutenant
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
governor position for New
 
05:02:22.868 --> 05:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and among the things uh that I
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
the response to this uh article this uh
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
opinion piece which I just passed out
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
was was very very positive uh among
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
other things I was invited to appear in
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
a radio network uh to talk about cac1
 
05:02:38.190 --> 05:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
there was some genuine um excitement
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
about the potential this measure has uh
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
and yesterday I emailed uh yall uh in
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
this committee the a link to the uh it's
 
05:02:51.788 --> 05:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
a fairly short radio uh uh Network
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
interview on this that uh could maybe
 
05:02:56.230 --> 05:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
complement a little bit what you'll hear
 
05:02:56.240 --> 05:02:57.230 align:start position:0%
complement a little bit what you'll hear
briefly

05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
here so um I do I do want to point out
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill does have bipartisan
 
05:03:06.110 --> 05:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
support uh I'm the only sponsor listed
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
because of dealing uh with the new
 
05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
fangled portal
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
process uh this has had multiple
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors in the past and and one of the
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
former sponsors is is here right now uh
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
so uh while I'm listed as the only
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor that's uh partly a function of
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
me in the timeline in the new portal
 
05:03:27.150 --> 05:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
process we will take the support of the
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
people that are willing to say they are
 
05:03:30.830 --> 05:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
supporting it for granted thank you
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair um yes so it's not just me
 
05:03:37.230 --> 05:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh So currently at least 43 states have
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Governors now I know that's
 
05:03:42.030 --> 05:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
not a reason for us to do that we're New
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but there is a strong case
 
05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
for looking at uh what we have in place
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
and how we can do it better uh in doing
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
it the New Hampshire way so we presently
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
have uh an extra constitutional
 
05:03:57.590 --> 05:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial line of succession a lot
 
05:03:59.350 --> 05:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
of you have been here before you've
 
05:04:02.510 --> 05:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
heard me and others bring this up before
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh and it's a problem it it's
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
potentially a big problem it's extra
 
05:04:08.948 --> 05:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional I'm a Civic guy I'm I'm
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
the guy who pushes the Civics bills
 
05:04:13.948 --> 05:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
forward and uh and this in the problem
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
some of you already know if you've had a
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
chance to look at some of the material
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
that has been pushed out
 
05:04:21.390 --> 05:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
previously um the Senate President the
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
state Senate President is the person who
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
replaces the governor in terms of line
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
of succession it's been that way yes for
 
05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
a long time uh this has most recently
 
05:04:34.868 --> 05:04:34.878 align:start position:0%
happened in 2016 when Senate President
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
Chuck moris uh replaced Maggie Hassen
 
05:04:40.548 --> 05:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
for governor Maggie Hassen briefly when
 
05:04:43.270 --> 05:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh she was sworn in as a US
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
senator uh that's happened earlier uh
 
05:04:48.910 --> 05:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
Ralph how from Lebanon was Senate
 
05:04:52.350 --> 05:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
President he replaced Jud Greg briefly
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh when uh Governor Greg became Senator
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
Greg in
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
1992 but Ponder what happened in
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
1982 when Senate President Vestor Roy
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
our first female governor actually uh
 
05:05:08.350 --> 05:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
she was sworn in as acting Governor or
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
as Governor uh after the death of uh
 
05:05:13.510 --> 05:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
Democrat ug
 
05:05:16.510 --> 05:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
Gallen uh who died a after the election
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
he was the incumbent Governor he was the
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
governor he passed away and and Vester
 
05:05:23.868 --> 05:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
Roy Senate President was uh sworn in to
 
05:05:26.548 --> 05:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
replace him uh they were of different
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
parties and that's part of the problem
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
part of the issue here assume gallon had
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
won that election in
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
1982 uh and then passed away uh he'd
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
have been replaced by somebody from a
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
different party that's just
 
05:05:40.638 --> 05:05:42.190 align:start position:0%
different party that's just
problematical

05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
problematical
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
so we
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
simply cannot and should not have the
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
same person leading both the executive
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
branch and the Executive Branch the uh
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
the Senate President as you all know uh
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
is ah head of the legislative bran
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
Senate President so to have the head of
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch become the head
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the Executive Branch is just
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally extra constitu there are
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
all kinds of problems with that and um
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
we we'll touch on them real
 
05:06:17.708 --> 05:06:17.718 align:start position:0%
quick so Morris and how and Roy did not
 
05:06:20.110 --> 05:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
resigned their jobs as Senate President
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
when they became when they were sworn in
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
as Governor but all three of those cases
 
05:06:26.750 --> 05:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
were for very short periods of time and
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
their tenures of office as chief chief
 
05:06:32.670 --> 05:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
executive uh were very limited but what
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
if a Senate President needed to serve
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
several months uh as chief executive uh
 
05:06:39.868 --> 05:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
I don't think Secretary of State SC is
 
05:06:41.190 --> 05:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
not here like I said he was here this
 
05:06:42.910 --> 05:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
morning he and I looked into this to
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
confirm the U the succession
 
05:06:49.548 --> 05:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
arrangements and what we learned uh and
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
confirmed in statute present in the
 
05:06:56.670 --> 05:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
present Constitution is that if a
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
governor died or left office in his his
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
or her first year uh they they would
 
05:07:04.030 --> 05:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
make an arrangement for a special
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
election if it happened in his second
 
05:07:08.708 --> 05:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
year or her second year uh then the
 
05:07:10.628 --> 05:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
Senate President would become acting
 
05:07:12.910 --> 05:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
governor for the whole year or or most
 
05:07:15.990 --> 05:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the year and so that raises all kinds
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
of really serious questions now we've
 
05:07:20.910 --> 05:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
been lucky I've been here before and
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
people have said we've been fine for 200
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
years you know we don't need a
 
05:07:26.548 --> 05:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor we it works
 
05:07:30.548 --> 05:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
perfectly well it it doesn't it hasn't
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh as an exam I know the committee
 
05:07:34.430 --> 05:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
report the last time around uh I went
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
back and checked it and it said uh our
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
system works perfectly well consider
 
05:07:43.628 --> 05:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
what happened uh some of you remember
 
05:07:45.470 --> 05:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Gardner speaking of
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of States who I've also spoken
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
to about this uh he shared that when he
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
was a new secretary of state which is a
 
05:07:56.350 --> 05:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
long time ago uh in terms of line of
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
succession the leaders of the state were
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
out of state he was became acting
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
Governor so while he was acting Governor
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
he signed some uh paperwork he signed
 
05:08:07.868 --> 05:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
this he signed that he swore in a
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
judge uh is acting governor and come to
 
05:08:12.910 --> 05:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
find out uh at the time Bill was uh in
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
his 20s he wasn't 30 years old yet so of
 
05:08:17.548 --> 05:08:17.558 align:start position:0%
course you know folks pouned and said
 
05:08:19.708 --> 05:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
all right the judge is illegitimate he
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
was sworn in by someone who was
 
05:08:23.470 --> 05:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
unqualified by con the Constitution to
 
05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
be the governor so no it hasn't worked
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly uh it's honestly straight talk
 
05:08:32.110 --> 05:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
it's the worst succession uh chief
 
05:08:32.120 --> 05:08:33.230 align:start position:0%
it's the worst succession uh chief
executive

05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
executive
 
05:08:36.628 --> 05:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
session uh plan in the country in in
 
05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
many of our views by
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
far so part of what would have what
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
would have happened if Governor sonono
 
05:08:44.430 --> 05:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
God forbid had been struck by lightning
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
in say n uh 2020 uh Donna Susi was the
 
05:08:50.548 --> 05:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
Pres Senate President and so uh Senator
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
suusi would have become the governor to
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
finish out sununu's
 
05:08:57.070 --> 05:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
term and what would she have done would
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
she have the government has like 15 or
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
so employees or on his staff would uh
 
05:09:05.948 --> 05:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
Governor Susi have kept uh Governor
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
sonuna staff in place uh could she work
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
with his people does she fire them all
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh we've been lucky that didn't happen
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh but it could and we need to to to
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
think about that the reverse was true in
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
2011 20 some of you will remember uh
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch his last term
 
05:09:30.430 --> 05:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh was uh the was dealing with a
 
05:09:32.030 --> 05:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislature in which his party was the
 
05:09:35.470 --> 05:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
minority in fact I met uh yesterday I
 
05:09:38.670 --> 05:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
saw Peter bragon who's the former uh
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
Senate President president at that time
 
05:09:42.990 --> 05:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
in fact I asked him to come in and and
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
and uh sit in on this I don't Peter
 
05:09:47.190 --> 05:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to make it but had something
 
05:09:50.310 --> 05:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
happened to Lynch a Democrat uh Peter
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
bragon Republican would have become
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
governor that's not how the people voted
 
05:09:58.030 --> 05:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's a terrible situation and uh again
 
05:09:59.628 --> 05:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
we we've been very
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
lucky so perhaps if a senate president
 
05:10:04.750 --> 05:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
became Governor they'd resign who knows
 
05:10:06.990 --> 05:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh but if they did resign to so that
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
they didn't lead two branches at the
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
same time which is utterly
 
05:10:10.638 --> 05:10:11.948 align:start position:0%
same time which is utterly
extra-constitutional

05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
extra-constitutional
 
05:10:14.190 --> 05:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh if they did resign as Senate
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
President then that disenfranchises you
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
know 5% of uh the the
 
05:10:22.868 --> 05:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
voters uh if they didn't or or if they
 
05:10:24.670 --> 05:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
kept their seat as these other Senators
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
did for short periods of time uh there's
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
all kinds of potential for for conflict
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
in fact the potentially someone could
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
Donna suusi or Peter bragon could have
 
05:10:40.670 --> 05:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh sponsored a measure in the
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislative branch and then became chief
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
executive and signed it is in the
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch it's uh it really is is
 
05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
is crazy so I I mentioned I did meet
 
05:10:53.070 --> 05:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
with Secretary of State scandin on this
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at the succession arrangements
 
05:10:56.990 --> 05:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
and they've already address that and
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that just doesn't
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
happen in other states so uh those of us
 
05:11:04.868 --> 05:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
who who care about uh a constitutional
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
succession plan uh have have come up
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
originally a couple of people who were
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
sponsors are now in the state senate and
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
and they actually I won't take credit
 
05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
for this had the idea of doing something
 
05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way having a citizen
 
05:11:21.270 --> 05:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant government just like we are
 
05:11:23.788 --> 05:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
all citizen legislators pay him the same
 
05:11:27.548 --> 05:11:27.558 align:start position:0%
as the Senate President $125 a year
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
which I've offered to pay as I did the
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
last time we came we went through this
 
05:11:34.110 --> 05:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
so this could be a wonderful example of
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
improving government in the best way
 
05:11:39.310 --> 05:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
essentially doubling
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
our gubernatorial Manpower at no cost
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
two Governors for the price of one and
 
05:11:47.430 --> 05:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's not I don't we don't see that as
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
bigger government we see that as better
 
05:11:52.548 --> 05:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
government the New Hampshire way um our
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
governor as you can imagine gets
 
05:11:55.948 --> 05:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
countless more invit they have a
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
full-time scheduler they get countless
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
more invitations for this or that or
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
this or that than they can possibly
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
respond to building dedications ribbon
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
cting testimonials funerals School
 
05:12:08.788 --> 05:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
visits on and on a lieutenant governor
 
05:12:08.798 --> 05:12:09.670 align:start position:0%
visits on and on a lieutenant governor
could

05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
the the capacity of the chief executive
 
05:12:14.948 --> 05:12:14.958 align:start position:0%
to do twice as
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
much the line of succession would be
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
cleaner New Hampshire voters would now
 
05:12:21.628 --> 05:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
vote for a ticket and be assured that
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
the state would avoid the chaos I
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
described that we've been generally
 
05:12:29.150 --> 05:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
lucky to avoid mostly uh if the sen
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
especially if the Senate presidents of a
 
05:12:33.390 --> 05:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
different party so again the sucession
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
issue addressed by the cacr is
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan there's no way to know which
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
part is going to control which branches
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
in the future it's a very nonpartisan
 
05:12:44.670 --> 05:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan measure it's just put in by
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
people who want us to do government in
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
the best
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
way um in earlier cacr and this topic
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
did not move forward as I mentioned uh
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
committee reports said we had a perfect
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
system just just utterly disagree we've
 
05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
been as I said we've been lucky I talked
 
05:13:04.510 --> 05:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
about Bill Gardner um and I have reached
 
05:13:06.430 --> 05:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
out to every former Governor regarding
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
the cacr every living governor former
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
Governor uh one of the responses I did
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
get back from a former Governor involved
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
a concern that the lieutenant governor
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
might not get along with the governor
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
because they they saw some other states
 
05:13:23.070 --> 05:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor would fight with the
 
05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
governor uh but in every State's
 
05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
different for as I said 43 states have
 
05:13:29.830 --> 05:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Governors but sometimes
 
05:13:31.708 --> 05:13:31.718 align:start position:0%
they're elected separately and that's
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
where there were some problems our
 
05:13:36.788 --> 05:13:36.798 align:start position:0%
proposal is to have them run a as a
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
ticket as a team uh so that there would
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
be a team in the primary whichever
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
ticket won the Primary would go on to
 
05:13:47.070 --> 05:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
the general election so there you have
 
05:13:47.080 --> 05:13:48.628 align:start position:0%
the general election so there you have
it

05:13:48.628 --> 05:13:48.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
um the questions last time around there
 
05:13:52.670 --> 05:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
were I do want to touch on this too
 
05:13:54.350 --> 05:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
before I before I
 
05:13:56.750 --> 05:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
close questions that came up last time
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
where will the desk be uh who's going to
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
pay for the business cards are they
 
05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to get a phone uh all good
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions I used to teach Noti such this
 
05:14:06.590 --> 05:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
thing as a bad question uh and the
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
answer my answer is that the Governors
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
would Define the roles of their
 
05:14:13.150 --> 05:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
lieutenants that's kind of how
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
presidents work with vice presidents and
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that's that's basically what
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
happened uh we would want to be clear
 
05:14:20.080 --> 05:14:20.910 align:start position:0%
happened uh we would want to be clear
that

05:14:20.910 --> 05:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
the uh lieutenant governor would be paid
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
$125 a year same as the Senate President
 
05:14:27.788 --> 05:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you that I did some
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
research the governor's office budget
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
right now is 2,1
 
05:14:36.510 --> 05:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
140,000 $39 for fy2 according to the
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
latest hb1 budget so the governor can
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
manage that budget and find the business
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
card money in that budget that they
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
already have they they so we don't want
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
to see any extra money whatsoever uh go
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
to putting in a lieutenant governor so
 
05:14:55.470 --> 05:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
and I I keep paring we've been fine
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
forever we've never done that before we
 
05:14:58.510 --> 05:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to grow government uh
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully I've made that clear this will
 
05:15:03.788 --> 05:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
cost nothing extra as we propos it and
 
05:15:06.110 --> 05:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
yet we get two Governors for No Ex to to
 
05:15:07.628 --> 05:15:07.638 align:start position:0%
do twice as much good work for New
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire make the lieutenant Governor a
 
05:15:11.590 --> 05:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
housing Zar or make the lieutenant
 
05:15:13.390 --> 05:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
governor a trade Ambassador there's so
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
much that could be done and it no extra
 
05:15:19.708 --> 05:15:19.718 align:start position:0%
extra cost so we see it as a win-win-win
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
better government fixes the extra
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem doubles the
 
05:15:26.788 --> 05:15:26.798 align:start position:0%
person power uh and uh as I look around
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
this room I do see a whole bunch of
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
potential future Lieutenant Governors I
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
really do um and I'll I'll stop there
 
05:15:36.670 --> 05:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take questions if if
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:43.390 --> 05:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
are there represent representative sloty
 
05:15:45.628 --> 05:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
and representative men
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
Howard yes thank you um in in this model
 
05:15:52.430 --> 05:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
do you envision the lieutenant governor
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm imagining the federal vice
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
president serves as the president of the
 
05:15:58.910 --> 05:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
Senate is there any Lieutenant governors
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
of other states that you're aware of who
 
05:16:02.590 --> 05:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
serve in similar roles think of the
 
05:16:04.390 --> 05:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
question in terms of other states having
 
05:16:06.510 --> 05:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
a similar model to what we propose here
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
is that kind of what you're I more so
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
that the the federal model is how I
 
05:16:13.470 --> 05:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
imagine these things work and it's
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
probably May is likely that not the
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
model that's used in the states in the
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
various States the it's my understanding
 
05:16:21.750 --> 05:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the vice president serves as the
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate is that corre
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
the terminology is that similar to how
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
the states operate and it it doesn't
 
05:16:28.510 --> 05:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
appear to be what the model that you're
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
offering here right it's really
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
fascinating with our federal system to
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
look at what other states do uh some uh
 
05:16:37.470 --> 05:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Governors are automatically
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
Senate presidents it varies in fact one
 
05:16:42.470 --> 05:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the speakers that's going to follow
 
05:16:45.270 --> 05:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
me fellow State represent actually some
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
research into that type of thing and I
 
05:16:50.190 --> 05:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
think she'll touch on some of that uh
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
and again the as I said earlier the
 
05:16:56.030 --> 05:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
actual roles of and assignments given to
 
05:16:57.990 --> 05:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor by the governor
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
If This Were Ever to move forward would
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
we see it as at the discretion of the
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
governor uh What uh you know some
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
presidents make their vice president uh
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
borders are or whatever uh so as I said
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
earlier if the governor were this to
 
05:17:17.708 --> 05:17:17.718 align:start position:0%
move forward if the governor wanted to
 
05:17:17.718 --> 05:17:18.830 align:start position:0%
move forward if the governor wanted to
uh

05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:22.190 --> 05:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
assign certain duties such as as I
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned before a how put them in in
 
05:17:27.868 --> 05:17:27.878 align:start position:0%
charge of a of a Housing Initiative or
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
have them oversee that type of thing or
 
05:17:33.350 --> 05:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
trade for example uh but uh I I think
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
one of the following speakers will touch
 
05:17:37.390 --> 05:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit better on what what you uh
 
05:17:40.590 --> 05:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
asked okay representative Howard thank
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I
 
05:17:45.070 --> 05:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
understand that you uh mentioned that
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor would be running
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
as a ticket alongside the governor and
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that would be selected during the
 
05:17:54.788 --> 05:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
primary process yes would you be willing
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
to uh allow parties to potentially uh
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
nominate a uh lieutenant governor after
 
05:18:05.070 --> 05:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
the primary thank you for the question
 
05:18:06.788 --> 05:18:06.798 align:start position:0%
uh interesting question the way we
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
envision this and the way the wording is
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
in the proposed uh cacr is that the
 
05:18:15.628 --> 05:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
there would be a team a ticket uh that
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
would be uh on the ballot for the
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
primary uh as to whether and I I I see
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
where your thought process is going if
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh if after the primary there was some
 
05:18:29.670 --> 05:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
folks who wanted to see a different
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
ticket if that could happen uh that's
 
05:18:34.990 --> 05:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
something I you you because you own this
 
05:18:36.548 --> 05:18:36.558 align:start position:0%
measure now you you could look at
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
rewarding that uh but presently the way
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
we initially uh submitted this uh the
 
05:18:44.270 --> 05:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
ticket is in place during the primary
 
05:18:46.590 --> 05:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
season uh but like I said I I know I
 
05:18:50.110 --> 05:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
know what you're thinking and u i i very
 
05:18:52.030 --> 05:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
interesting I understand the sentiment
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
to maybe what if somebody like one
 
05:18:56.788 --> 05:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
person from each of two different
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
tickets could they combine them uh
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that's not part of this
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
current cacr thank you yes but I believe
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
current election law if there isn't
 
05:19:10.868 --> 05:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
someone on the ticket allows the party
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
to fill
 
05:19:15.868 --> 05:19:15.878 align:start position:0%
it this yeah I'm getting a hearing next
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
week uh Madam chair so oh
 
05:19:22.830 --> 05:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
sorry anyway I it's my P my
 
05:19:25.470 --> 05:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is if there is a vacancy
 
05:19:28.628 --> 05:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
on the ticket after the primary the
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
party can can choose to fill it right uh
 
05:19:35.990 --> 05:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh sec I'm not an expert uh secretary
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
scandin isn't here unfortunately uh he
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
was uh I've talked to him several he was
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
here this morning uh not that he was
 
05:19:44.990 --> 05:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to take a position on it but uh
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know the question that just came up
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
as Secretary of State and I as I said I
 
05:19:52.190 --> 05:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
Al also talked to Bill Gardner uh the
 
05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State could better uh
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
address that type of scenario and I also
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
point out uh as with all of our you know
 
05:20:02.230 --> 05:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a committee chair I understand the
 
05:20:05.110 --> 05:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
committee's own these now uh depending
 
05:20:07.590 --> 05:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
point you do with this uh you certainly
 
05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
can U look at some different language is
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
I reread it today uh it wasn't clear in
 
05:20:15.910 --> 05:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
the current language about the
 
05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
$125 uh payment which our intent when we
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
went to OS before and this time was to
 
05:20:23.948 --> 05:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
be clear that they would be lieutenant
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
governor would be paid the same as the
 
05:20:27.270 --> 05:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
Senate President and that wording isn't
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
as clear uh out of os as I would have
 
05:20:32.390 --> 05:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
liked that to be that's another piece
 
05:20:34.350 --> 05:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
you could possibly look at if you wanted
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
to to make sure it's clear uh what the
 
05:20:40.310 --> 05:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
compensation would be okay thank you
 
05:20:42.510 --> 05:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you representative
 
05:20:49.750 --> 05:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.350 --> 05:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you madam chair and
 
05:20:55.110 --> 05:20:55.120 align:start position:0%

05:20:56.670 --> 05:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
I served on this committee for four
 
05:20:58.548 --> 05:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
years not most of you weren't on the
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee at the time but it's good to
 
05:21:02.990 --> 05:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
see yall um and I will say
 
05:21:05.948 --> 05:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett was correct uh
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
when the Porto was introduced his bill
 
05:21:09.310 --> 05:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
was early
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
I saw the button and it just said on the
 
05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
front page that I should have clicked
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
through if you want to opt out of any
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislation click here if you'd clicked
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
there as I later learned you could also
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
agree to be on a Bill had I known that I
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
would have clicked through at early um
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
and forly been a co-sponsor of this bill
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
again um and I and I think it's a great
 
05:21:38.990 --> 05:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
idea uh as it happens I've worked in uh
 
05:21:41.910 --> 05:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
nine other states before New Hampshire
 
05:21:44.350 --> 05:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
including where I grew up Kentucky I
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
worked for the lieutenant governor of
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
Kentucky when he was running for US
 
05:21:51.590 --> 05:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
Senate he did not win um but it was a
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful experience I I watched as the
 
05:21:58.830 --> 05:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
governor uh of that time was running for
 
05:22:01.990 --> 05:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
office and the process as it happened
 
05:22:04.590 --> 05:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
when he chose Steve Henry to be his
 
05:22:06.590 --> 05:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor and it was really
 
05:22:08.910 --> 05:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
exciting obviously they have a St St
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
they even have a place to live I mean
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's this is the new H the bill the way
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's written is how we would do it in
 
05:22:15.200 --> 05:22:15.910 align:start position:0%
it's written is how we would do it in
New

05:22:15.910 --> 05:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:22:19.990 --> 05:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to me uh and I think it's
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
the fairest way to do it not a lot of
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
money like almost zero dollar um I like
 
05:22:28.548 --> 05:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
the idea of a citizen lieutenant
 
05:22:31.868 --> 05:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
governor um and uh just to address a
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
couple quick points that were asked um I
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't remember exactly how it's written
 
05:22:39.990 --> 05:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill but if if you want the
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor to serve as a
 
05:22:45.310 --> 05:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
tiebreaker the way our vice president is
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea you know we have 24 state
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
senators which leads to one of my
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
biggest reasons that I support this um
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
if a Senate President uh becomes
 
05:23:00.990 --> 05:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
Governor especially for a long time uh
 
05:23:03.510 --> 05:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that means they've only been elected by
 
05:23:07.070 --> 05:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
23 or less people you know maybe only
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
50% plus one of the chamber so 13 people
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know versus uh the choice of a
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor to be on a ticket
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
with a gubernatorial candidate obviously
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
we would all have that choice whether
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the primary with our own party
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
or in the general election it gives that
 
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
candidate time to get to know folks out
 
05:23:33.310 --> 05:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
in the state um someone also asked when
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
would they be chosen um I liked what the
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
chair said but if that's a contention
 
05:23:41.750 --> 05:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
for you I encourage you to look at that
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
but um you know ultimately this could be
 
05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
um to quote a president I like you know
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
um our next Governor's uh first best
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
choice it's a great way to look at the
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
type of people that they would consider
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh working with it could give them an
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expand to maybe a place
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
that that gubernatorial candidate
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a natural strength in you
 
05:24:12.510 --> 05:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
know whether it's a part of the state or
 
05:24:16.350 --> 05:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
a different gender or older or younger I
 
05:24:19.230 --> 05:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
just think that this what the way that
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
this resolution I think that's what we
 
05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
call this not a bill um right resolution
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
resol yes uh you know I think the way
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
that it's written is just very much in
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
the in the sense of what of New
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can imagine that the um
 
05:24:39.070 --> 05:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial candidate would choose
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
someone who would already be traveling
 
05:24:46.510 --> 05:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
in with and in support of him or her um
 
05:24:49.510 --> 05:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
anyway uh and I can't really see a
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
downside to this um other than maybe
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
fixing a few things that you may
 
05:24:58.548 --> 05:24:58.558 align:start position:0%
disagree with the resolution on if you
 
05:25:00.510 --> 05:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
um like the questions
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
reflected um having said that I'm happy
 
05:25:05.948 --> 05:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
to take any questions you may have but I
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
will you know I'm a Democrat I'm happy
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
to show that I am one of more quite a
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
few Democrats that also support this
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
effort thank you representative Schultz
 
05:25:19.230 --> 05:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions no very good job it's great to
 
05:25:23.910 --> 05:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
see you all thank you so much
 
05:25:23.920 --> 05:25:32.910 align:start position:0%
see you all thank you so much
representative

05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
F thank you madam chair and members of
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh I am Lily Foss I'm a
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
first-term democratic rep from
 
05:25:44.110 --> 05:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh representing Awards 245
 
05:25:46.510 --> 05:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
and 7 in the Hillsboro 41
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
floweral uh aside from being a new State
 
05:25:52.350 --> 05:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
Rep I have a degree in politics with an
 
05:25:54.788 --> 05:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
emphasis in legal studies from scripts
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
college and between that uh Temple
 
05:26:02.110 --> 05:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
University School of Law and my uh
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate habit of listening to
 
05:26:06.788 --> 05:26:06.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional oral arguments just for
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
fun uh I have background in
 
05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional law uh so when I have
 
05:26:16.350 --> 05:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
looked at uh when representative Moffett
 
05:26:18.910 --> 05:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
asked me to you know look at this
 
05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
resolution and potentially speak on
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
it I read it I I asked him what he uh
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
you know what what's your advocacy and I
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
asked what are the arguments against and
 
05:26:35.070 --> 05:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
from my understanding and again I am I
 
05:26:38.910 --> 05:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
am a first term rep the uh a lot of the
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
arguments against were we haven't needed
 
05:26:44.590 --> 05:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
it so far it's been years we haven't
 
05:26:47.110 --> 05:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
needed it it hasn't come up and perhaps
 
05:26:49.470 --> 05:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's just me being a first term Rip but
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
that argument just in general seems
 
05:26:55.948 --> 05:26:55.958 align:start position:0%
rather strange to me because if you had
 
05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
a structural flaw in a bridge you
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wait until the bridge collapse
 
05:27:04.030 --> 05:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
to do anything about it you don't wait
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
until you're dead to buy life insurance
 
05:27:09.230 --> 05:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
you if you see something that could
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
become a problem in the future you
 
05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
change it and if we weren't in a
 
05:27:16.150 --> 05:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
legislative context that would seem
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
irresponsible not
 
05:27:18.200 --> 05:27:19.868 align:start position:0%
irresponsible not
to

05:27:19.868 --> 05:27:19.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
but you make the argument well we
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
haven't need it so far I mean
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative mfet gave some examples
 
05:27:31.390 --> 05:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
where this has come up but I if you know
 
05:27:33.750 --> 05:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps someone was inclined to think
 
05:27:36.548 --> 05:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
that well that's relatively minor the
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
consequences you know potentially
 
05:27:42.110 --> 05:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
weren't that impactful um as I said I
 
05:27:44.430 --> 05:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
have a background in constitutional law
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
so I would like to draw the committee's
 
05:27:49.750 --> 05:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
attention to the 12th Amendment of the
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
US Constitution and the election of 1796
 
05:27:58.948 --> 05:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
so the election of 1800 gets a lot of uh
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
attention and an entire song in Hamilton
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
but the election of 1796 was actually
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
the only election where the president
 
05:28:08.310 --> 05:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
and the vice president were of of
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
different parties uh John Adams that was
 
05:28:13.190 --> 05:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
his one presidential term and then
 
05:28:16.470 --> 05:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas Jefferson was the vice president
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's because the way the Constitution
 
05:28:21.868 --> 05:28:21.878 align:start position:0%
was originally written uh an elector
 
05:28:24.830 --> 05:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
seven states direct the popular vote
 
05:28:28.350 --> 05:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
elected their electors and then in nine
 
05:28:31.390 --> 05:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
states uh the state legislature elected
 
05:28:34.910 --> 05:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
their electors the electors voted for
 
05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
two people but they weren't on separate
 
05:28:39.868 --> 05:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
presidential and vice presidential
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
tickets they couldn't vote for the same
 
05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
person so the person who won the most
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
votes provided it was a majority of the
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
votes would become the president the
 
05:28:51.628 --> 05:28:51.638 align:start position:0%
runnerup would become the vice president
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
so that and some interference by
 
05:28:57.070 --> 05:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton is how you ended up
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
with the Federalist Johan Adams as the
 
05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
president and the uh Democratic
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
Republican Thomas Jefferson as the vice
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
president at first they were cordial but
 
05:29:10.230 --> 05:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning uh Jefferson
 
05:29:12.990 --> 05:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
stopped Consulting with Adams on any
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
political decisions
 
05:29:19.150 --> 05:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so because of well not
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
because of but because of this Discord
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
focus on on on the on the point please
 
05:29:27.030 --> 05:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
of course well this is an example this
 
05:29:30.430 --> 05:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
Discord that arose from
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
having uh legislators or a vice
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
president and a president of two
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
different parties uh this is the same
 
05:29:42.670 --> 05:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
kind of Discord that could result if we
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
were to have a uh a governor who perhaps
 
05:29:48.750 --> 05:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
was of a different party than their
 
05:29:52.110 --> 05:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
staff or the um members who had been
 
05:29:54.390 --> 05:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
appointed by the other governor and
 
05:29:56.788 --> 05:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
furthermore it's not who the voters of
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would have voted for you
 
05:30:02.510 --> 05:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
know say the president of the Senate who
 
05:30:04.590 --> 05:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
became governor was a different party
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
than the governor that's not what the
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
voters of New Hampshire want wanted in
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
their gubernatorial candidate and to
 
05:30:13.990 --> 05:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
speak again as the to the bipartisanship
 
05:30:17.470 --> 05:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
you know I'm a Democrat if the president
 
05:30:20.590 --> 05:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the Senate became uh Governor it
 
05:30:24.390 --> 05:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
would not benefit my party any uh the
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
governor you know not of my party so
 
05:30:29.310 --> 05:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
this is purely I'm I'm here because the
 
05:30:31.190 --> 05:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
voters of New Hampshire deserve to have
 
05:30:33.628 --> 05:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
a governor who represents who they voted
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
for uh and I
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
again I hope that uh not just the
 
05:30:43.470 --> 05:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
historical examples but just thinking of
 
05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
the potential consequences and what's uh
 
05:30:49.628 --> 05:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
more reflective of the voters of New
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I hope that the committee
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
will support this
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you very much are there
 
05:30:57.400 --> 05:30:58.708 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you very much are there
any

05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any so thank you
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay I I checked off I'm opposed to this
 
05:31:19.788 --> 05:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
bill and um I think probably in its
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
current Farm better not to send this to
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
the voters but I uh obviously I wouldn't
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
be here if I didn't think it was an
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
interesting idea so I
 
05:31:30.030 --> 05:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate U so enjoyed listening to the
 
05:31:32.070 --> 05:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
previous previous previous three reps
 
05:31:33.948 --> 05:31:33.958 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan group of three reps so I
 
05:31:35.310 --> 05:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
think certainly probably the proper
 
05:31:37.390 --> 05:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
course of action is to retain the bill
 
05:31:38.750 --> 05:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
because I think even the supporters
 
05:31:41.910 --> 05:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
agree it might need some tweaking um I'm
 
05:31:43.990 --> 05:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
not sure whether it's a good idea to
 
05:31:45.948 --> 05:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
have pay just the lieutenant governor
 
05:31:48.990 --> 05:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
just $125 a year since that's a somewhat
 
05:31:50.948 --> 05:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh job of somewhat different nature than
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
being you know a senator even the Senate
 
05:31:55.548 --> 05:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
President so that would probably become
 
05:31:58.350 --> 05:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
a full-time job and there would also
 
05:32:00.070 --> 05:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
there' be some significant cost because
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
this person would probably need a
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
security detail they would need probably
 
05:32:05.708 --> 05:32:05.718 align:start position:0%
like they probably at least have some
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
staffers they probably couldn't just use
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
all the staffers from the uh governor's
 
05:32:13.070 --> 05:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
office or from the Senate cuz this uh
 
05:32:16.590 --> 05:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
individual would be the uh be the the
 
05:32:18.510 --> 05:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
president it would also be the president
 
05:32:20.070 --> 05:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the Senate so they' be essentially a
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
25th member of the Senate even though
 
05:32:24.830 --> 05:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
they would vote only when there's a tie
 
05:32:26.708 --> 05:32:26.718 align:start position:0%
which actually there are lots of ties in
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate because theyve even a number
 
05:32:31.390 --> 05:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
of Senators so um probably some of their
 
05:32:33.430 --> 05:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
budget could come out of the could come
 
05:32:34.830 --> 05:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
out of the Senate but there would be a
 
05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
significant cost and um so I just I
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
think probably I recognize you may need
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
to do some work on the line of
 
05:32:44.190 --> 05:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
succession and this might be a vehicle
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
you could use to do that but I think um
 
05:32:49.150 --> 05:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
probably probably be best either not
 
05:32:50.670 --> 05:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
have a lieutenant governor or to
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
actually pay them you know have have
 
05:32:55.788 --> 05:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
them set the salary during the budget
 
05:33:00.230 --> 05:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
process which um and of course um the
 
05:33:01.830 --> 05:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
budget process it'll be a while before
 
05:33:03.310 --> 05:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
there be a budget process that could
 
05:33:06.070 --> 05:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
deal with it because if if indeed you
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
pass this or some amended version of it
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
um it would would be voted on in
 
05:33:11.600 --> 05:33:12.670 align:start position:0%
um it would would be voted on in
November

05:33:12.670 --> 05:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
November
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
2026 um obviously the office would be
 
05:33:20.350 --> 05:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
office would be vacant throughout 2027
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
and 20 2028 and also the next future
 
05:33:26.788 --> 05:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
legislators leg legislature would have
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
to work on probably some enabling
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislation you know they need to flesh
 
05:33:32.190 --> 05:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
out what the powers of this person is
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
what their duties are what
 
05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we have to them so
 
05:33:37.350 --> 05:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
there obviously there have to be some
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
compan Indian bills so be a you do have
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
a while to uh you've got like a whole
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
year before you even have to send any
 
05:33:46.948 --> 05:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
decide what to send over to the other
 
05:33:48.670 --> 05:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
body the body that
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
will body like who's President the um
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
who's President the lieutenant governor
 
05:33:55.708 --> 05:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
would be at least in this version of the
 
05:33:57.510 --> 05:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill so you know you've we've got a
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
while before we have to sort everything
 
05:34:01.230 --> 05:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
out I will say I've only unlike R
 
05:34:02.628 --> 05:34:02.638 align:start position:0%
Schultz I've only worked in one other
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
state house and that was in
 
05:34:06.510 --> 05:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they have a lieutenant
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
governor if I recall correctly is
 
05:34:11.470 --> 05:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
elected separately from the governor um
 
05:34:13.868 --> 05:34:13.878 align:start position:0%
most of them been pretty pretty obscure
 
05:34:16.190 --> 05:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
but uh John kery was recent the
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
legislative governor of of uh legisl
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor of Massachusetts and
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
you've all heard of him there was uh
 
05:34:25.590 --> 05:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
Jane Swift who became the uh youngest
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
Governor I think in at the time I think
 
05:34:29.948 --> 05:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
in US history who was a well she was the
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
acting Governor so she was the
 
05:34:32.470 --> 05:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor when the governor
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
resigned um so
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and I think you in that case
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
actually they made the governor a member
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
of the governor's councils they have a
 
05:34:44.310 --> 05:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
Governor's Council has much less power
 
05:34:45.948 --> 05:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
than ours but they do have one so you
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
could also add you know you could have
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
that Governor be the chair of the
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
governor's Council or something or uh so
 
05:34:55.628 --> 05:34:55.638 align:start position:0%
maybe there probably other other so
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's another possibility what
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
you could do with this person to keep
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
them busy while they're waiting around
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
for the governor to leave and certainly
 
05:35:04.190 --> 05:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
and also you may want to flesh out what
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
the senten it says about what to do if
 
05:35:07.350 --> 05:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's a vacancy in the off office of
 
05:35:08.788 --> 05:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
government although that's probably not
 
05:35:10.670 --> 05:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
a bad approach to have only have the
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
special election if the governor dies
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
resigns or otherwise leaves uh before um
 
05:35:19.548 --> 05:35:19.558 align:start position:0%
before the first first term of his her
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
term is up but that's probably something
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
else you could appropriately appropriate
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
look at while you're dealing with this
 
05:35:29.868 --> 05:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
cacr so I would certainly um so I
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
certainly would uh I certainly wouldn't
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
be able to I certainly would not be one
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
of the 240 votes if this came if this
 
05:35:40.270 --> 05:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
was sent to the floor um as is but I
 
05:35:41.310 --> 05:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
think there's probably a pretty good
 
05:35:42.628 --> 05:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
chance you're going to work on it
 
05:35:44.510 --> 05:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of an interesting idea
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
so I would uh so I certainly urge you to
 
05:35:50.628 --> 05:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
at least um come up with something you
 
05:35:52.510 --> 05:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
know it's a there may be I think there's
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
like some interesting ideas you may want
 
05:35:55.868 --> 05:35:55.878 align:start position:0%
to make it even more interesting before
 
05:35:58.270 --> 05:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
you send it over here and so um right
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
now I would not be one of the 240 people
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
you would need to passed us on to the
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and then to the voters so so I'd
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions thank you
 
05:36:10.350 --> 05:36:10.360 align:start position:0%

05:36:13.788 --> 05:36:13.798 align:start position:0%
questions no all right thank does anyone
 
05:36:16.990 --> 05:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify on
 
05:36:19.708 --> 05:36:19.718 align:start position:0%

05:36:58.110 --> 05:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
Cal I am sorry these we had two bills
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
that took a great deal more time than we
 
05:37:03.750 --> 05:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
thought they would I apologize uh no
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
problem actually I was downstairs in
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
executive session so the timing worked
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
out so thank you convenient
 
05:37:14.110 --> 05:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
um so thank you uh thank you madam
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and members of the committee
 
05:37:18.750 --> 05:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Jim kofalt
 
05:37:21.628 --> 05:37:21.638 align:start position:0%
I represent Hillsburg County District 32
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
which is the towns of Wilton Temple and
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
new IP
 
05:37:28.830 --> 05:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
switch H Bill 470 is intended to address
 
05:37:31.830 --> 05:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
some serious concerns about access to
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
care patient safety and health care
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
costs these concerns were brought to my
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
attention last year when the New
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of dental examiners
 
05:37:45.430 --> 05:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
proposed rule changes to Jael car aimed
 
05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
at restricting qualified Dental
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
professionals from administering
 
05:37:51.788 --> 05:37:51.798 align:start position:0%
sedation and anesthesia under certain
 
05:37:54.190 --> 05:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances these changes would have
 
05:37:56.110 --> 05:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
significant negative consequences for
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
the people of New
 
05:38:01.350 --> 05:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh would have put New
 
05:38:03.390 --> 05:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dramatically out of sync with
 
05:38:05.390 --> 05:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
nationally accepted standards for
 
05:38:07.150 --> 05:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
Dentistry we it would they would have
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
made the only state in the country to
 
05:38:11.788 --> 05:38:11.798 align:start position:0%
impose these kinds of unnecessary
 
05:38:14.590 --> 05:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions fortunately uh the proposed
 
05:38:17.830 --> 05:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
rule changes were not adopted um when
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
they were brought before gel car I
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
believe that the Dental Board of
 
05:38:23.708 --> 05:38:23.718 align:start position:0%
examiners has uh circled back to make
 
05:38:25.708 --> 05:38:25.718 align:start position:0%
some revisions that would probably be in
 
05:38:27.868 --> 05:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
line as I understand are probably going
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be in line with the bill before you
 
05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
um having said that I still think the
 
05:38:35.830 --> 05:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill is important so that we can assure
 
05:38:38.948 --> 05:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
be assured that we have uh a clear
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
statement of legislative intent as to
 
05:38:42.868 --> 05:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
what is appropriate and what is not
 
05:38:44.468 --> 05:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate under the
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances so what this bill would do
 
05:38:48.990 --> 05:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
is it would affirmatively supersede
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
those proposed changes by preserving the
 
05:38:53.070 --> 05:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
scope of practice that has always uh
 
05:38:54.990 --> 05:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
been applied in New Hampshire and
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
assuring that it continues to align with
 
05:38:59.230 --> 05:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized standards for
 
05:39:02.590 --> 05:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
Dentistry um so just by way background
 
05:39:05.750 --> 05:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
um dentists use moderate sedation deep
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
sedation and general aesthesia to calm
 
05:39:11.350 --> 05:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
patients with anxiety and to comfortably
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
treat patients who are undergoing
 
05:39:13.040 --> 05:39:14.628 align:start position:0%
treat patients who are undergoing
painful

05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
painful
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
procedures when a general or uh
 
05:39:20.190 --> 05:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
pediatric dentist determines that a
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
patient's condition requires additional
 
05:39:24.548 --> 05:39:24.558 align:start position:0%
expertise or additional equipment they
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
make may make a referral to a uh
 
05:39:30.990 --> 05:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
maxilofacial surgery office um so an
 
05:39:31.000 --> 05:39:33.390 align:start position:0%
maxilofacial surgery office um so an
oral

05:39:33.390 --> 05:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.390 --> 05:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
surgeon an oral and Max maxilofacial
 
05:39:40.628 --> 05:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
surgeon or om um generally under goes
 
05:39:43.590 --> 05:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
four to 6 years of residency training uh
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
in a hospital based setting uh that is
 
05:39:48.310 --> 05:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
generally uh you know followed by
 
05:39:51.468 --> 05:39:51.478 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience on average um so
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
these are people who are highly highly
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
qualified to treat patients in their
 
05:39:59.070 --> 05:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
offices with
 
05:40:01.150 --> 05:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
sedation the proposed rule brought
 
05:40:03.310 --> 05:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
brought by the Dental Board uh was was
 
05:40:06.270 --> 05:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
Den 304 and that would have mandated the
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
presence of a separate anesthesia
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
provider um for patients under 9 years
 
05:40:11.200 --> 05:40:12.190 align:start position:0%
provider um for patients under 9 years
of

05:40:12.190 --> 05:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:40:16.390 --> 05:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
age uh in that case um the the MS the
 
05:40:18.270 --> 05:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
the surgeon in question would have to
 
05:40:20.990 --> 05:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
wait for an anesthesia provider uh
 
05:40:23.390 --> 05:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
either either do that or attempt to
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
transfer the patient to a hospital or
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
would have to refer them to the
 
05:40:29.230 --> 05:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
emergency room uh it's also worth noting
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
that we have a shortage of anesthesia
 
05:40:33.390 --> 05:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire and Hospital
 
05:40:36.270 --> 05:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
capacity is is restricted in many places
 
05:40:38.030 --> 05:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
at many times
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the you know why would they want to
 
05:40:41.510 --> 05:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
do this well the impetus for this
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
proposed change arose um as a result of
 
05:40:46.910 --> 05:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
the death of a child in California some
 
05:40:49.830 --> 05:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
years ago after a thorough
 
05:40:52.270 --> 05:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
investigation um the the state of
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
California determined that in that case
 
05:40:57.310 --> 05:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
it was the practitioner who was at fault
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
not the system of
 
05:41:02.190 --> 05:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
delivery um and
 
05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
so some people have used this as a as a
 
05:41:08.830 --> 05:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
as a basis for one to restrict scope of
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
of practice for for these oral
 
05:41:14.350 --> 05:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
surgeons um currently Dental
 
05:41:15.788 --> 05:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
Professionals in New Hampshire follow
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
very strict guidelines for informed
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
consent uh they can work with parents
 
05:41:22.430 --> 05:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Guardians to make sure that they are
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh fully informed of the the benefits
 
05:41:27.670 --> 05:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
and the risks of
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
sedation the risks of of moderate
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
sedation the risk of sedation in general
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
are extraordinarily low um the informed
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
consent process generally involves also
 
05:41:41.708 --> 05:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
informing patients of what the
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
alternatives are and what the risks are
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
associated with those Alternatives
 
05:41:48.788 --> 05:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
because um there there are often risks
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
associated with with any given
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
alternative um
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
so in my view it is the uh the
 
05:41:59.868 --> 05:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
individual Dental professionals and
 
05:42:01.708 --> 05:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
their patients who who should be working
 
05:42:04.628 --> 05:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
together to determine uh the best course
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
of action and the best procedures that
 
05:42:07.750 --> 05:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
they want to follow
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
to assure adequate patient care um
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
working with parents and Guardians uh in
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
the case of of children under
 
05:42:19.468 --> 05:42:19.478 align:start position:0%
N9 so that current model really affords
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
us a safe and cost-effective means of
 
05:42:23.230 --> 05:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
delivering these
 
05:42:25.190 --> 05:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
services and I don't believe that that
 
05:42:26.708 --> 05:42:26.718 align:start position:0%
should change and I've spoken to many
 
05:42:28.548 --> 05:42:28.558 align:start position:0%
Dental professionals who do not believe
 
05:42:30.868 --> 05:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
that that should change we have never
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
seen an incident in New Hampshire that
 
05:42:36.430 --> 05:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
would justify this level of massive
 
05:42:39.788 --> 05:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
change to the system so there are
 
05:42:41.868 --> 05:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
significant negative consequences that
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
would arise from such a
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
change uh first it would increase the
 
05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
cost of care so um if you can imagine
 
05:42:51.750 --> 05:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
that you're required to bring on an
 
05:42:53.948 --> 05:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
anesthesia professional professional for
 
05:42:55.350 --> 05:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
certain uh
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
procedures um it also would potentially
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
require that certain procedures be
 
05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
performed in a hospital setting it would
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
create new limits on access to care as
 
05:43:07.670 --> 05:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
well so without access to office-based
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
options uh many patients in New
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would have to um wait long
 
05:43:14.670 --> 05:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
they would have longer wait times for
 
05:43:14.680 --> 05:43:16.190 align:start position:0%
they would have longer wait times for
treatment

05:43:16.190 --> 05:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:43:19.948 --> 05:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
potentially um and presumably they would
 
05:43:21.868 --> 05:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
have additional costs associated with
 
05:43:23.708 --> 05:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
hospital care if that is where they get
 
05:43:26.150 --> 05:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
their services uh as a result of it of
 
05:43:27.110 --> 05:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
such a
 
05:43:30.750 --> 05:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
change this would also preclude Medicaid
 
05:43:32.150 --> 05:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
patients from getting treatment
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
requiring moderate sedation so it it has
 
05:43:38.150 --> 05:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
an effect on people um without the means
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
to um fund these things or without
 
05:43:41.040 --> 05:43:43.030 align:start position:0%
to um fund these things or without
private

05:43:43.030 --> 05:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
private
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
insurance um in many cases this rule
 
05:43:48.030 --> 05:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
would have the effect of of essentially
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
forcing certain procedures to happen in
 
05:43:52.708 --> 05:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
a hospital setting adding further cost
 
05:43:55.468 --> 05:43:55.478 align:start position:0%
and also requiring patients who may
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
already have significant anxiety to be
 
05:44:00.150 --> 05:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
treated in a very clinical environment
 
05:44:04.628 --> 05:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
whereas dental offices tend to be um
 
05:44:06.670 --> 05:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
relatively calming places that may be
 
05:44:06.680 --> 05:44:08.030 align:start position:0%
relatively calming places that may be
familiar

05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
05:44:10.510 --> 05:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
um you know for me you know I it it also
 
05:44:12.590 --> 05:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that this could have an
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
especially negative impact on people
 
05:44:16.468 --> 05:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities so some
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
of you I think are aware that I have a a
 
05:44:21.750 --> 05:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
particular Keen interest in um advancing
 
05:44:23.990 --> 05:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh advancing the interests of of people
 
05:44:26.230 --> 05:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
with Autism and families of people with
 
05:44:31.070 --> 05:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
Autism and um there is a there is
 
05:44:33.310 --> 05:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
discomfort associated with things like
 
05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
going to the dentist or undergoing um
 
05:44:40.270 --> 05:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
oral Sur surgery um that level of
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
discomfort and anxiety as you can
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
imagine is Amplified considerably if
 
05:44:47.150 --> 05:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
somebody is taken to an unfamiliar
 
05:44:49.390 --> 05:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
setting with unfamiliar people in a in a
 
05:44:51.628 --> 05:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
more clinical environment so that could
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
be overwhelming I think to a lot of
 
05:44:55.510 --> 05:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
05:44:55.520 --> 05:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
um

05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:01.708 --> 05:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
so well I understand that those proposed
 
05:45:03.708 --> 05:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
changes are not at this point slated to
 
05:45:06.190 --> 05:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
go into effect and that the Dental Board
 
05:45:08.468 --> 05:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
is working to address the concerns that
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
were raised in the in the Jael car
 
05:45:13.430 --> 05:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
process um I do believe that this bill
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
should still move forward at this point
 
05:45:16.910 --> 05:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that it's important for the
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
legislature to assert um its intention
 
05:45:24.390 --> 05:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
and um assure that any rule changes that
 
05:45:27.310 --> 05:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
go forward do not unnecessarily restrict
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
scope of practice increase cost of care
 
05:45:32.390 --> 05:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
and decrease patient access that ends my
 
05:45:37.150 --> 05:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm open to questions
 
05:45:38.750 --> 05:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Sellers and then
 
05:45:41.548 --> 05:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair
 
05:45:44.830 --> 05:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative um so the intent here is
 
05:45:49.670 --> 05:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
to allow your typical dentist to give
 
05:45:54.468 --> 05:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
more sedation or a stronger U um what do
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
I want to say painkiller if you want to
 
05:45:57.628 --> 05:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
say to like pull a tooth or something
 
05:46:00.270 --> 05:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
like that uh thank you for the question
 
05:46:03.750 --> 05:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
so it's the purpose of this legislation
 
05:46:05.788 --> 05:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
is to allow Dental professionals to
 
05:46:07.270 --> 05:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
continue what they've been doing for
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
many many many years and that they have
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
been trained to do and um have undergone
 
05:46:16.150 --> 05:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
Hospital residency training to do um it
 
05:46:20.708 --> 05:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
applies primarily to um OMS oral
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
um sorry I don't have it in front of me
 
05:46:26.070 --> 05:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um we'll accept oral surgeons
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons yes so so I would I would
 
05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
defer to some of the people who are
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
probably going to be speaking after me
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
to give further details but but I would
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
stress that really when when I filed
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
those rules were still under the old
 
05:46:42.510 --> 05:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
rules were still under
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
consideration um I would still like to
 
05:46:46.590 --> 05:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
see it move forward because I think we
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be clear about legislative
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
intent having said that um the the the
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
primary answer to your question is this
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill would allow them to do what they
 
05:47:00.270 --> 05:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
have always done they have always done
 
05:47:02.110 --> 05:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
safely in New Hampshire we've never had
 
05:47:04.430 --> 05:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
any negative incidents um surrounding
 
05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
this issue and um it would align New
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or have New Hampshire continue
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
to align with nationally recognized
 
05:47:16.110 --> 05:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
standards representative
 
05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam
 
05:47:22.590 --> 05:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
chair so um did I understand you
 
05:47:24.910 --> 05:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
correctly to say that were we to go
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
forward with this legislation we would
 
05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
be the only state to do to have such
 
05:47:32.628 --> 05:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
legislation in the United States was was
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
that your testimony thank you for the
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
question no it was not it was actually
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
the opposite if the rules this this
 
05:47:44.990 --> 05:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is intended to um to prevent
 
05:47:47.430 --> 05:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
any rules such as the ones that were
 
05:47:50.628 --> 05:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
proposed from going into effect so by
 
05:47:53.468 --> 05:47:53.478 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation well let me
 
05:47:55.628 --> 05:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
back up if those rules had gone into
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
effect we would have been the only state
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
to have such restrictions on scope of
 
05:48:04.830 --> 05:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
practice by passing this legislation we
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
would be guaranteeing that we are
 
05:48:09.510 --> 05:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to align with nationally
 
05:48:11.310 --> 05:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
recognized standards that every other
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
state is is practicing thank you okay
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
other questions representative sers I'm
 
05:48:18.510 --> 05:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
sorry I should have asked you for follow
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
no that's okay thank you madam chair so
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
so right now they can they can use the
 
05:48:25.230 --> 05:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
anesthetic that's necessary that's what
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying correct they they can all
 
05:48:32.350 --> 05:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
right thank you any other
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
05:48:37.310 --> 05:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative citech you
 
05:48:40.468 --> 05:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
you uh you said that and then you talked
 
05:48:43.150 --> 05:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
at length about a lot of things uh that
 
05:48:47.788 --> 05:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
Happ which are all all all right
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
now um isn't that true I mean it went
 
05:48:52.990 --> 05:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
through quite a bit it sounded like
 
05:48:54.990 --> 05:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
these were prohibited or you have to do
 
05:48:57.708 --> 05:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
this go to the oral surgeon probably
 
05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
does flag work too
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
Vex um that's all that's all moot right
 
05:49:09.190 --> 05:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
now no the the rule rules are still have
 
05:49:11.150 --> 05:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
are still being developed and we don't
 
05:49:13.468 --> 05:49:13.478 align:start position:0%
know what exactly the board of dental
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
examiners will present they are still We
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
There was an objection and they are
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
going going back to work on them we do
 
05:49:25.390 --> 05:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
not know what would come up prophylactic
 
05:49:28.830 --> 05:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank thank you so so my answer to
 
05:49:32.270 --> 05:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
the question um I appreciate um the
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
chairwoman's uh comments yes it's the
 
05:49:38.590 --> 05:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
the objective of the legislation at this
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
point is to serve as a back stop and
 
05:49:43.708 --> 05:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
make sure that we protect patient safety
 
05:49:48.510 --> 05:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
access to care and um reasonable costs
 
05:49:50.990 --> 05:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you uh Tommy Burke
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Leon wishes to
 
05:50:09.150 --> 05:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh members of the
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Erica Lon
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
representing the town of dairy um as a
 
05:50:17.430 --> 05:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill I wanted to come
 
05:50:19.230 --> 05:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
up here into this more appropriate space
 
05:50:22.110 --> 05:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
to speak um on the reasons and necessity
 
05:50:25.590 --> 05:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
for this bill um previously in past
 
05:50:27.390 --> 05:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
years there was a bill that was adopted
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
that was rather reactionary to that
 
05:50:31.468 --> 05:50:31.478 align:start position:0%
circumstance of that child that died in
 
05:50:33.788 --> 05:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
California some of the language that was
 
05:50:36.190 --> 05:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
passed was interpreted in such a way by
 
05:50:38.310 --> 05:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine while trying to
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
implement these um implement the new
 
05:50:43.390 --> 05:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
rules that allowed for it to be much
 
05:50:45.868 --> 05:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
more restrictive than anywhere else in
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the country the language of the law has
 
05:50:49.948 --> 05:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
the May statement that is in there that
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
then that is crossed out because it
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
provided for the ability to exempt um
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
oral maxio facial surgeons to continue
 
05:50:59.430 --> 05:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
practicing the way that they've always
 
05:51:02.070 --> 05:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
been trained to do and to continue on
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
with their high level of training to
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
provide this anesthesia and these and
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
this sort of um pain control and comfort
 
05:51:12.110 --> 05:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
care the way that it was interpreted was
 
05:51:14.750 --> 05:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
ambiguous as to the legislative intent
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
so this bill was filed to make it clear
 
05:51:19.468 --> 05:51:19.478 align:start position:0%
that we're not looking to have make our
 
05:51:21.468 --> 05:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
oral surgeons operate in a an
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
environment that's more restrictive than
 
05:51:25.510 --> 05:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the country we are want
 
05:51:27.868 --> 05:51:27.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure that patients are safe
 
05:51:30.190 --> 05:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
which is why this references the um
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
National standards we want also want to
 
05:51:34.310 --> 05:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is done in a way
 
05:51:35.948 --> 05:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to preclude New
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children from getting this
 
05:51:40.990 --> 05:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
care because there is not just a risk of
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
um anesthesia there's also a risk from
 
05:51:45.868 --> 05:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
not being treated so if a patient has a
 
05:51:48.990 --> 05:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
be a abscess they have an infected tooth
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they're not able to get treatment in
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
the right time they people have died
 
05:51:54.110 --> 05:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
from that and we don't want children who
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
are not able to be treated because they
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
can't find a nurse and esus to come in
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
or there's not Hospital space the
 
05:52:03.788 --> 05:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
treatment is is delayed and then that
 
05:52:05.628 --> 05:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
infection then takes that child's life
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill to make to make clear
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
that it that the with the training and
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
with those standards these oral surgeons
 
05:52:15.468 --> 05:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
are able to continue doing what they've
 
05:52:17.708 --> 05:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
done we need this this change in law
 
05:52:20.070 --> 05:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful to ensure that the
 
05:52:22.310 --> 05:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
rules that are in process and are
 
05:52:24.468 --> 05:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to be um drafted in a
 
05:52:27.150 --> 05:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
way that's consistent with this that
 
05:52:29.310 --> 05:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
they move forward and then in the future
 
05:52:31.468 --> 05:52:31.478 align:start position:0%
the same concern over legislative intent
 
05:52:33.788 --> 05:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't come up on Rural renewal and
 
05:52:35.430 --> 05:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
then put us right back in this position
 
05:52:37.110 --> 05:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
where we may be denying access to care
 
05:52:37.120 --> 05:52:37.868 align:start position:0%
where we may be denying access to care
for

05:52:37.868 --> 05:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
children okay are there any questions
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
repres pitech you met of examiners you
 
05:52:47.708 --> 05:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
meant Board of dental examiners didn't
 
05:52:49.868 --> 05:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
you said Board of Medicine who who has
 
05:52:52.070 --> 05:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over this it's been a long
 
05:52:53.708 --> 05:52:53.718 align:start position:0%
day for all of us I think it's Dental
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
examiners okay all right just the
 
05:52:55.920 --> 05:52:58.708 align:start position:0%
examiners okay all right just the
appropriate

surgeons in that role I represent the 52
 
05:53:36.788 --> 05:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
surgeons in our state who strive to um
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
achieve safe and affordable access to
 
05:53:43.190 --> 05:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
care for our our patients um I'm also
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
joined by two of my colleagues drors
 
05:53:47.390 --> 05:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
bean and Malik who will also plan to

provide testimony um about um their um
 
05:53:52.868 --> 05:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
experience as well as our anesthesia
 
05:53:55.310 --> 05:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
safety um track record as well as our
 
05:53:58.708 --> 05:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
concerns for access to care um I'm
 
05:53:59.910 --> 05:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
really grateful for the opportunity to
 
05:54:02.030 --> 05:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
speak with you all today about HP 470
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
which I urge you to support um the Crux
 
05:54:07.468 --> 05:54:07.478 align:start position:0%
of this is that we are looking to
 
05:54:09.510 --> 05:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
establish and strengthen the dental
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
practice act um so that oral surgeons or
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
ms's whatever you want to call us um can
 
05:54:19.430 --> 05:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh provide sedation but also comply with
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
anesthesia um regulations that are in
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
line with national standards um we are
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
as was outlined by by representative
 
05:54:31.070 --> 05:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
kofalt um we're extensively trained we
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
spend 8 to 10 years in training after
 
05:54:36.670 --> 05:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
college um throughout Dental SCH School
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
Medical School residency training to be
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
able to do procedures as well as
 
05:54:42.548 --> 05:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
administer anesthesia to our patients
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we take lightly
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
and something that we take very
 
05:54:49.030 --> 05:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
seriously um like many of my colleagues
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the state um I obtained my medical
 
05:54:53.150 --> 05:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
degree as well as my dental degree on
 
05:54:56.030 --> 05:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
the path to becoming an oral surgeon so
 
05:54:59.510 --> 05:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
you may ask why is this bill necessary
 
05:55:02.948 --> 05:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
so the bill is necessary um due to the
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
previous proposal by the Dental Board um
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
of den 304 um which moved to make the
 
05:55:13.070 --> 05:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
anesthesia outpatient anesthesia model
 
05:55:15.788 --> 05:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
that we use um to be more restrictive
 
05:55:18.750 --> 05:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
and prohibitive and we had concerns
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the changes that were proposed
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
because um this could potentially
 
05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
restrict um access to care for patients
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
and also restrict our ability um and um
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
how we administer anesthesia in our
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
offices um to give you context in
 
05:55:36.548 --> 05:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
dentistry there are different
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
organizations the national standards of
 
05:55:41.788 --> 05:55:41.798 align:start position:0%
care for training are provided by the
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
commission on Dental accreditation or
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
Koda now with regards to parameters of
 
05:55:49.830 --> 05:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
care and what you can do that is
 
05:55:51.868 --> 05:55:51.878 align:start position:0%
dictated by individual specialty
 
05:55:54.070 --> 05:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
organizations my organization the
 
05:55:56.548 --> 05:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
American associ Association of oral and
 
05:55:58.708 --> 05:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
maxal facial surgeons um there's also
 
05:56:00.590 --> 05:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
the American Dental Association American
 
05:56:03.590 --> 05:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
Academy for Pediatric Dentistry Etc um
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
there has been collaboration a lot of
 
05:56:07.868 --> 05:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
different Dental Specialties actually
 
05:56:11.310 --> 05:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
administer anesthesia and there's been
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration amongst the different
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
Dental Specialties um in particular the
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh American Academy of Ms um the dental
 
05:56:23.190 --> 05:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
anesthesia committee um as well as
 
05:56:25.468 --> 05:56:25.478 align:start position:0%
periodontology um collaborated and
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
issued joint um joint guidelines that
 
05:56:31.990 --> 05:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
provide a framework for individual
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
states to write legislation um that uh
 
05:56:38.430 --> 05:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
for these for these contacts and this
 
05:56:40.948 --> 05:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
was this um these guidelines were
 
05:56:45.468 --> 05:56:45.478 align:start position:0%
drafted after um significant uh
 
05:56:48.110 --> 05:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration and deliberation um and
 
05:56:50.030 --> 05:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation amongst the issues
 
05:56:51.430 --> 05:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
amongst these different Specialties
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
which is not an easy task um the
 
05:56:55.868 --> 05:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
concerns and I think those have been
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
well outlined about what was proposed
 
05:56:59.110 --> 05:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
with Den
 
05:57:03.310 --> 05:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
304 and we proposed um or we advocated
 
05:57:07.030 --> 05:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
about this at jail car um was that
 
05:57:09.310 --> 05:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
the the changes that would be proposed
 
05:57:11.230 --> 05:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
with that with Den 304 would be that
 
05:57:14.430 --> 05:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
time sensitive emergency treatment um
 
05:57:16.110 --> 05:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
particularly for Pediatric patients
 
05:57:18.270 --> 05:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be possible in many offices in
 
05:57:20.788 --> 05:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
particular with deep sedation because
 
05:57:22.468 --> 05:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
what would be mandated is that we would
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
be required to have a second anesthesia
 
05:57:26.948 --> 05:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
provider present which is not something
 
05:57:29.830 --> 05:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's typically done on an on call
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
basis that can be done on a same day
 
05:57:34.708 --> 05:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
basis um so the concerns in those
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
emergency scenarios is these patients
 
05:57:39.948 --> 05:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
would then need to present to the
 
05:57:41.708 --> 05:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
emergency room be admitted to the
 
05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
hospital and then this ends up being a
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
greater um cost to the patients as well
 
05:57:49.628 --> 05:57:49.638 align:start position:0%
as um to the greater Health Care System
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
um as well and it's not just oral
 
05:57:53.948 --> 05:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
surgeons by the way um it's not
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
something that we we were just you know
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
we are all trained to do this but in
 
05:58:00.548 --> 05:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
addition pediatric dentists for example
 
05:58:03.628 --> 05:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
are trained to do moderate sedation and
 
05:58:06.468 --> 05:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
as those rules were written and uh with
 
05:58:08.510 --> 05:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
the original version of den
 
05:58:12.110 --> 05:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
304 um those uh no pediatric dentist
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to administer moderate
 
05:58:14.910 --> 05:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
sedation in the state as they were
 
05:58:20.190 --> 05:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
written now jail car did move the uh
 
05:58:21.788 --> 05:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
rules back to the Dental Board and they
 
05:58:23.990 --> 05:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
have been um working hard to revise
 
05:58:26.190 --> 05:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
those we commend them for the revisions
 
05:58:27.788 --> 05:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
that have been made and feel like they
 
05:58:30.990 --> 05:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
have made some positive steps however um
 
05:58:34.150 --> 05:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
we believe that the changes in HB 470
 
05:58:36.270 --> 05:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
are still necessary to help improve the
 
05:58:38.270 --> 05:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
dental practice act as those changes are
 
05:58:41.548 --> 05:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
still pending as of this hearing um as
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
was outlined there's no other state in
 
05:58:45.868 --> 05:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
the country that has these um the
 
05:58:49.468 --> 05:58:49.478 align:start position:0%
regulations in Den 304 um in states that
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
actually had adverse outcomes such as in
 
05:58:54.910 --> 05:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
California North Carolina and Texas
 
05:58:58.868 --> 05:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
there were analyses of these um of these
 
05:59:01.670 --> 05:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
these cases and looked at a larger data
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
set and they ultimately decided to not
 
05:59:08.190 --> 05:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
adopt such a restrictive position so in
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
in short you know the state of New
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as um doctors doctors
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
like like myself um sh responsibility to
 
05:59:17.310 --> 05:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
provide patient safety and access to
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
care we need this language in law for
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
the board of dental examiners to write
 
05:59:24.628 --> 05:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
rules that are in line with national
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
standards of
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
Care thank you thank you are there any
 
05:59:31.310 --> 05:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative scitec and then
 
05:59:35.190 --> 05:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
Schmidt um Dr Burke I got president and
 
05:59:37.910 --> 05:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
I got Mex facial but I didn't get all in
 
05:59:40.670 --> 05:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
between there's quite a mouthful there
 
05:59:43.230 --> 05:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
so to speak who so to speak what what's
 
05:59:45.150 --> 05:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
your title president of what I'm
 
05:59:47.430 --> 05:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Society
 
05:59:51.310 --> 05:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
of oral and Maxell facial surgeons nhss
 
05:59:53.230 --> 05:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
is probably the easiest way to write it
 
05:59:53.240 --> 05:59:54.708 align:start position:0%
is probably the easiest way to write it
oral

05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
oral
 
05:59:54.718 --> 05:59:56.350 align:start position:0%
oral
and

05:59:56.350 --> 05:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
surgeons okay okay thank you
 
06:00:01.628 --> 06:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair okay so as a member of the Jael
 
06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
car I believe you were not there the day
 
06:00:09.270 --> 06:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we wrestled with this at the jelar
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
but you and I spoke subsequently so the
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
language that we're looking at is
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
language which you and your legal
 
06:00:21.670 --> 06:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
Associates have have um perfected shall
 
06:00:21.680 --> 06:00:22.390 align:start position:0%
Associates have have um perfected shall
we

06:00:22.390 --> 06:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:00:26.910 --> 06:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
say yes the goal of this is to Bas
 
06:00:28.708 --> 06:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
basically not make things more
 
06:00:30.788 --> 06:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
restrictive as they currently are and I
 
06:00:32.070 --> 06:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
think that was there was some
 
06:00:34.150 --> 06:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
questioning earlier it seemed that you
 
06:00:37.070 --> 06:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
know well it it's you know we're it's a
 
06:00:39.390 --> 06:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
um problem in search of a or a solution
 
06:00:41.150 --> 06:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
in sear problem in search of a solution
 
06:00:43.750 --> 06:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
I should say so follow up okay follow up
 
06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
so and what I'm concerned about is
 
06:00:53.548 --> 06:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
getting uh lawmaking in between uh a
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
doctor and his patient in a way and I'm
 
06:00:58.708 --> 06:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
concerned that if the language is not
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
perfect uh that it may lead to uh a
 
06:01:04.990 --> 06:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
tieup uh that would not be in the
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
interest of either either the doctors or
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
their patients because as I understand
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
it these circumstances are somewhat
 
06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
unusual because they involve um children
 
06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
sometimes very small children who are uh
 
06:01:23.788 --> 06:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
have been injured in some face in some
 
06:01:26.750 --> 06:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
way like a been struck by a baseball bat
 
06:01:29.750 --> 06:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
or a car accident or whatever where you
 
06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
have a very small patient that has a big
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
problem uh and they need emergency
 
06:01:38.868 --> 06:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
surgery to save their life um so what
 
06:01:40.468 --> 06:01:40.478 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is whether the
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
language could potentially get in the
 
06:01:45.468 --> 06:01:45.478 align:start position:0%
way of something that as long as these
 
06:01:49.150 --> 06:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
Dental rules are not uh you know in
 
06:01:51.270 --> 06:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
place and they are not before the jel
 
06:01:57.390 --> 06:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
car yet uh uh you can proceed as as
 
06:01:59.868 --> 06:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative kall testified you can
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
proceed to to practice best practice
 
06:02:07.030 --> 06:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
medicine uh dentistry in this case
 
06:02:10.948 --> 06:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know as needed by the patient uh
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
and under the circumstances that you are
 
06:02:16.708 --> 06:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
best qualified to dictate in other words
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
this would have to go into a hospital
 
06:02:21.070 --> 06:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
with all of facilities that you might
 
06:02:25.590 --> 06:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
not have um in your practice so you
 
06:02:28.110 --> 06:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
could do it right now the the rules are
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
not likely to get approved unless they
 
06:02:33.868 --> 06:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
are um
 
06:02:36.548 --> 06:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
also not going to prevent you from doing
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
what you need to do and what you
 
06:02:43.230 --> 06:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
currently can do uh so uh are you
 
06:02:45.590 --> 06:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
satisfied that the language that is
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
before us right
 
06:02:51.150 --> 06:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
now cannot possibly be misinterpreted to
 
06:02:53.628 --> 06:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
prevent you from being able to do what
 
06:02:57.070 --> 06:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
you currently can do with the with the
 
06:02:59.310 --> 06:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
verbiage that's in there we we tried to
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
make it so that it was in line with
 
06:03:03.788 --> 06:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
national standards so as far as it's
 
06:03:04.910 --> 06:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
written right now that would not
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
restrict our ability to do um what we
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
what we doing currently okay well that's
 
06:03:13.708 --> 06:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
very important thank you other
 
06:03:13.718 --> 06:03:15.230 align:start position:0%
very important thank you other
questions

06:03:15.230 --> 06:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:03:17.390 --> 06:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
speeches all right thank you doctor
 
06:03:40.708 --> 06:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:43.030 --> 06:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
06:03:45.548 --> 06:03:45.558 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Salon Malik I'm
 
06:03:48.310 --> 06:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
an oral surgeon uh I've been in private
 
06:03:51.590 --> 06:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire for uh since
 
06:03:54.990 --> 06:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
1997 uh like Dr Burke I'm licensed both
 
06:03:57.628 --> 06:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
in Dentistry and Medicine I'm board
 
06:04:00.110 --> 06:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
certified in oral Maxwell facial surgery
 
06:04:02.628 --> 06:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
and uh in Dental anesthesia by the
 
06:04:04.350 --> 06:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
American Dental Society of
 
06:04:06.510 --> 06:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
anesthesiology just to give you an idea
 
06:04:09.830 --> 06:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
in general uh I average about 400
 
06:04:12.468 --> 06:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
anesthesia cases a year in my practice
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
which is probably the the standard the
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
the typical pace for an neural surgeon
 
06:04:21.868 --> 06:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
in private practice um and uh like most
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
surgeons it's a single uh practitioner
 
06:04:28.590 --> 06:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
model so I deliver the anesthesia and I
 
06:04:31.270 --> 06:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
do the surgery and as an oral surgeon
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
usually I say you know the buck stops
 
06:04:36.190 --> 06:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
here in in dentistry itself when
 
06:04:37.830 --> 06:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
things get to the point where they need
 
06:04:40.150 --> 06:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
to be done and it can be done usually
 
06:04:42.150 --> 06:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
the oral surgeon ends up treating those
 
06:04:44.670 --> 06:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
kind of cases so this is where access to
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
care and patient safety and uh health
 
06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
care costs become important because of
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
the kind of rules and regulations we
 
06:04:54.788 --> 06:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
have to deal with in order to provide
 
06:04:54.798 --> 06:04:55.948 align:start position:0%
have to deal with in order to provide
that

06:04:55.948 --> 06:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
care um I think we can all agree that
 
06:05:01.788 --> 06:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
patient safety is the most important
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
issue here and patient safety is not
 
06:05:07.868 --> 06:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
just a one one single term that we need
 
06:05:10.468 --> 06:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
to look at uh as has been discussed
 
06:05:13.948 --> 06:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
before uh the cost and access to care
 
06:05:16.910 --> 06:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're all intertwined if a p if a
 
06:05:19.110 --> 06:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
patient whether it's an adult or a child
 
06:05:21.868 --> 06:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
can't have the kind of uh care that he
 
06:05:24.430 --> 06:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
or she needs at the moment now we're
 
06:05:27.070 --> 06:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
looking at issues that may be difficult
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
to resolve and we get to a point of
 
06:05:31.948 --> 06:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
trying to decide what to do so I'm in
 
06:05:35.670 --> 06:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
full support of this bill um I would say
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
say that uh all you have to do is really
 
06:05:40.990 --> 06:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
look at sort of like an example so if if
 
06:05:43.310 --> 06:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's a patient and usually it's a
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
child uh who needs uh an emergency
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
dental care and it's really medicine
 
06:05:53.150 --> 06:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's dental medicine it's all the same
 
06:05:56.548 --> 06:05:56.558 align:start position:0%
um the patient ends up in my office I
 
06:05:58.910 --> 06:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision the decision
 
06:06:01.468 --> 06:06:01.478 align:start position:0%
will always come in first without money
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
involved what does the child need and if
 
06:06:06.510 --> 06:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's an emergency it has to be treated
 
06:06:09.390 --> 06:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
and timing is important but it's biology
 
06:06:11.310 --> 06:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about in the moment it
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
could be within an hour it could be a
 
06:06:15.948 --> 06:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
day it could be a week and that's the
 
06:06:18.430 --> 06:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
position I'm in to make that decision if
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
something is going to be done within the
 
06:06:22.468 --> 06:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
next couple of hours which is what I
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to do I have to make a decision can
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
I do it in the office if there are so
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
many restrictions where I have to get as
 
06:06:29.708 --> 06:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
was mentioned before another
 
06:06:31.670 --> 06:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist or an
 
06:06:33.910 --> 06:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
anesthetist I probably won't be able to
 
06:06:35.830 --> 06:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
do the case and the child probably won't
 
06:06:38.430 --> 06:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
get that care that day I would then have
 
06:06:40.110 --> 06:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
to make a decision okay I can take them
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
to the hospital because I have
 
06:06:42.948 --> 06:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
privileges to take patients to the
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
hospital I can do it in the O well since
 
06:06:47.948 --> 06:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
covid it's not that easy to take a child
 
06:06:51.270 --> 06:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
or any patient to the O all right so
 
06:06:53.948 --> 06:06:53.958 align:start position:0%
let's say I do get that time and
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
probably it's not going to be that day
 
06:06:58.670 --> 06:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
and in residency training we always
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
heard you know never let sunset or
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
sunrise or sunset on an absess so if I'm
 
06:07:06.670 --> 06:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
going to have that child not treated
 
06:07:07.910 --> 06:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
that day I'm going to have to wait
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
another day now patient safety is
 
06:07:11.590 --> 06:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
another issue whether the child needs to
 
06:07:14.548 --> 06:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
be admitted or not when I do take that
 
06:07:17.070 --> 06:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
patient to the O ever since covid the
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
quality of care in the O is different
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as it used to be in my
 
06:07:25.030 --> 06:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
office I have three surgical assistants
 
06:07:27.510 --> 06:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
they're all pediatric Advanced life
 
06:07:31.350 --> 06:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
cardiac they're all um trained with
 
06:07:33.070 --> 06:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
certifications they're all dance
 
06:07:35.150 --> 06:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
certified which is another certification
 
06:07:37.948 --> 06:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
where they learn how to administer as an
 
06:07:40.788 --> 06:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
assistant anesthesia with the surgeon
 
06:07:43.468 --> 06:07:43.478 align:start position:0%
but if they go to the O I have a crew
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't know me as well I don't
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
know them I have equipment that I've not
 
06:07:49.948 --> 06:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
worked with on a daily basis so that's
 
06:07:52.708 --> 06:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
another compromise now that's assuming
 
06:07:55.750 --> 06:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
we can take the child to the O that day
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
if I can't take the patient to the O in
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
that hospital now I have to start
 
06:08:01.628 --> 06:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
thinking about referring that patient
 
06:08:04.628 --> 06:08:04.638 align:start position:0%
and the only referral I can make from my
 
06:08:04.638 --> 06:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
and the only referral I can make from my
practice

06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
practice
 
06:08:07.788 --> 06:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh is usually going to be someplace in
 
06:08:09.788 --> 06:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
Boston and that's not very cost
 
06:08:11.868 --> 06:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
effective and again time becomes an
 
06:08:11.878 --> 06:08:13.548 align:start position:0%
effective and again time becomes an
issue

06:08:13.548 --> 06:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:08:16.190 --> 06:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
and from a practical point of view then
 
06:08:17.750 --> 06:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'd have to have that conversation with
 
06:08:19.948 --> 06:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
the parents and say I know the
 
06:08:22.070 --> 06:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
anesthesia would have been couple $100
 
06:08:24.190 --> 06:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
in an office setting now you're going to
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital presumably either
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
locally or in in uh outside of the state
 
06:08:32.190 --> 06:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be in the thousands of
 
06:08:34.150 --> 06:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
dollars and it's all because of
 
06:08:36.030 --> 06:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions that were that were thought
 
06:08:38.430 --> 06:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
of at one point or another yes the board
 
06:08:39.468 --> 06:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
of dental
 
06:08:42.190 --> 06:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
examiners uh is revisiting the
 
06:08:43.990 --> 06:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions that they were thinking
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
about putting in uh but I think with
 
06:08:49.708 --> 06:08:49.718 align:start position:0%
this bill in place we'll have a Model A
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
a standardized model that we can at
 
06:08:54.510 --> 06:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
least look to and then use now it's
 
06:08:56.670 --> 06:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
still not going to be black and white I
 
06:08:57.868 --> 06:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
language when you deal with medicine
 
06:09:02.190 --> 06:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
when you deal with surgery when you deal
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
with Biology it can't be black and white
 
06:09:07.310 --> 06:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there'll be some things that we
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
may need to
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
change uh what they are I can't tell you
 
06:09:13.868 --> 06:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
because I look at the patient I I don't
 
06:09:16.430 --> 06:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
look at the words but those words are
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to help us at least form a
 
06:09:20.350 --> 06:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
template to do what we need to do and
 
06:09:22.350 --> 06:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
which what we've been doing for for
 
06:09:25.150 --> 06:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
decades in the state of New Hampshire um
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
I'll stop my comments here so if there
 
06:09:29.468 --> 06:09:29.478 align:start position:0%
are any questions thank you
 
06:09:31.430 --> 06:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has a
 
06:09:33.830 --> 06:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
question so I I've given a lot of
 
06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
thought to this doctor every since I
 
06:09:38.350 --> 06:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
talked with Dr Burks I serve on the Jael
 
06:09:39.708 --> 06:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
car you I don't believe you were there
 
06:09:43.590 --> 06:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
the day that we heard this and and
 
06:09:45.990 --> 06:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
objected to the proposed rules from the
 
06:09:49.150 --> 06:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
Bode okay uh and there was there were a
 
06:09:52.590 --> 06:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
number of uh of oral surgeons there who
 
06:09:55.270 --> 06:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
were begging us basically please do not
 
06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
accept these rules because they will
 
06:10:00.310 --> 06:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
potentially uh you know potentially
 
06:10:03.670 --> 06:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
affect the life survival of of a small
 
06:10:06.110 --> 06:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
child um so so I've given a lot of
 
06:10:08.350 --> 06:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
thought uh to it and talk with Dr Burks
 
06:10:12.030 --> 06:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth um but and you have
 
06:10:13.830 --> 06:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed this language because I'd
 
06:10:17.070 --> 06:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
rather stay out of it not
 
06:10:20.468 --> 06:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
have legislation getting in between the
 
06:10:22.310 --> 06:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
doctors and their and their patients
 
06:10:24.548 --> 06:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd rather not do nothing and
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
let you continue to do what you
 
06:10:28.830 --> 06:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
currently can do thank you then have
 
06:10:32.350 --> 06:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
Lang language which uh still has to go
 
06:10:34.390 --> 06:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
through the Senate even if we adopt it
 
06:10:37.230 --> 06:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
here uh and it passes the house which
 
06:10:39.628 --> 06:10:39.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it would uh it's going to have
 
06:10:41.430 --> 06:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
to go to the Senate so we're talking
 
06:10:41.440 --> 06:10:43.070 align:start position:0%
to go to the Senate so we're talking
about

06:10:43.070 --> 06:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:10:46.230 --> 06:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
months uh before it would be ready for
 
06:10:47.390 --> 06:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
the Governor's
 
06:10:49.868 --> 06:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
signature uh
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering whether you have
 
06:10:54.510 --> 06:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed this language yourself and
 
06:10:56.788 --> 06:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
you're as comfortable with it as Dr
 
06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
Burke do well I reviewed the language
 
06:11:02.830 --> 06:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
but I can honestly tell you I can't say
 
06:11:04.750 --> 06:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable because I'm not that
 
06:11:04.760 --> 06:11:05.948 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable because I'm not that
knowledgeable

06:11:05.948 --> 06:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
about the language is the only way I can
 
06:11:09.948 --> 06:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
put it I mean I agree with what's
 
06:11:11.910 --> 06:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
written in there and if there are going
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:11:15.670 --> 06:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
some issues that need to be resolved
 
06:11:17.628 --> 06:11:17.638 align:start position:0%
it's not something I can I feel I'm an
 
06:11:20.070 --> 06:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
expert at to to say yes there are some
 
06:11:22.390 --> 06:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made okay thank
 
06:11:25.590 --> 06:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
you and thank you we understand the
 
06:11:28.230 --> 06:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
intent okay represent scitech you have a
 
06:11:30.670 --> 06:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
question you said you did 400 of these a
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
year you do two a day yes wow well two a
 
06:11:37.310 --> 06:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
day or three three or four a day because
 
06:11:42.590 --> 06:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
know we we thank you for your service

practicing a board certified or maxal
 
06:12:10.750 --> 06:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
surgeon out of Manchester and Penbrook
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to first thank uh
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
representative Kofa and representative
 
06:12:19.390 --> 06:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
Lyon for uh uh their testimony that is
 
06:12:21.948 --> 06:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh I think they summarized a lot of
 
06:12:24.070 --> 06:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
things that I was going to touch on as
 
06:12:28.030 --> 06:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
did Dr Bert and Dr Malik um so I'll try
 
06:12:32.350 --> 06:12:32.360 align:start position:0%

06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
locations as well as our Danver
 
06:12:53.788 --> 06:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts location um so I've had
 
06:12:55.788 --> 06:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
some experience in different areas in
 
06:12:57.788 --> 06:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire even New England
 
06:12:59.510 --> 06:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
I've practiced in other states such as
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
Colorado South Carolina and Kentucky um
 
06:13:05.788 --> 06:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
so I have a perspective on outside
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
philosophies and modalities even with my
 
06:13:10.468 --> 06:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
own profession um I currently hold
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
privileges at Elliot Hospital and
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
Catholic Medical Center uh the HB 470 in
 
06:13:21.548 --> 06:13:21.558 align:start position:0%
my mind is uh designed to uh serve the
 
06:13:23.350 --> 06:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and preserving
 
06:13:26.390 --> 06:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
their access to our services as well as
 
06:13:28.510 --> 06:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
the services of the pediatric
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
dentist um the rule changes that were
 
06:13:32.670 --> 06:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
proposed before they you know as
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's already said at this point
 
06:13:36.590 --> 06:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
were very restricted
 
06:13:38.510 --> 06:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
and would have had they gone through
 
06:13:40.590 --> 06:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
made us the most restrictive State
 
06:13:43.548 --> 06:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
that's a uh true statement and that the
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
the other problem is you had no viable
 
06:13:48.510 --> 06:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
alternative for their care like even the
 
06:13:51.910 --> 06:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
board at that meeting recommended that
 
06:13:54.788 --> 06:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh if they were not able to gain access
 
06:13:56.750 --> 06:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
to our clinic for care because of these
 
06:13:58.350 --> 06:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions that they should just go to
 
06:14:00.510 --> 06:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital and they'll deal with it
 
06:14:01.750 --> 06:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
that was that was literally the
 
06:14:03.510 --> 06:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that the board of dentistry
 
06:14:07.628 --> 06:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
gave I can't begin to explain how wrong
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
that is uh that being said obviously the
 
06:14:12.708 --> 06:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
things have kind of pulled back and Jae
 
06:14:15.310 --> 06:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
car sent it back to them I agree but you
 
06:14:17.628 --> 06:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
had asked about the language of this and
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
I I mean I I would in part agree with Dr
 
06:14:24.468 --> 06:14:24.478 align:start position:0%
Malik I'm not the expert but I would
 
06:14:26.830 --> 06:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
agree that it does state that hey we're
 
06:14:29.150 --> 06:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to follow these National
 
06:14:31.708 --> 06:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
guidelines National guidelines are
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
fairly specific in how they lay out what
 
06:14:37.628 --> 06:14:37.638 align:start position:0%
our rules rules are now what happens
 
06:14:38.670 --> 06:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:14:41.350 --> 06:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
Senate they make a change now is that
 
06:14:43.270 --> 06:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
does that change things here yeah I
 
06:14:46.030 --> 06:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't know I can't control that but what
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
I would say is I do support this bill as
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
it is written and um how is and I do
 
06:14:54.708 --> 06:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
think the way it is written uh leaves
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
room for practitioners to make decisions
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
here on their own preserve their
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
autonomy with uh pediatric patient
 
06:15:05.150 --> 06:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
population and the rest of the demog
 
06:15:06.310 --> 06:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
Graphics in New
 
06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in a way that that that
 
06:15:10.670 --> 06:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
serves this
 
06:15:14.430 --> 06:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
state uh you know we are well trained um
 
06:15:16.270 --> 06:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
you know they mentioned the you know
 
06:15:18.548 --> 06:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
time Beyond College uh we we do four to
 
06:15:20.910 --> 06:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
six years of residency depending on your
 
06:15:25.230 --> 06:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
program um the there is a five month
 
06:15:27.548 --> 06:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
minimum on anesthesia service in which
 
06:15:30.310 --> 06:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
you are the primary anesthesia provider
 
06:15:32.670 --> 06:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
in an operating room so you mentioned
 
06:15:34.628 --> 06:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
teeth yeah we do that in our clinic but
 
06:15:35.670 --> 06:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:15:37.190 --> 06:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
in our training if you're coming in for
 
06:15:38.910 --> 06:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
your appendix you might get us as your
 
06:15:38.920 --> 06:15:40.190 align:start position:0%
your appendix you might get us as your
anesthesia

06:15:40.190 --> 06:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
anesthesia
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
provider um you know so that that we do
 
06:15:45.628 --> 06:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
for five months in addition to that
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's a minimum requirement of at
 
06:15:49.750 --> 06:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
least one month dedicated to Pediatric
 
06:15:52.430 --> 06:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
anesthesia uh so specific to that
 
06:15:55.070 --> 06:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
population and if even with those
 
06:15:56.910 --> 06:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
requirements we're still required to
 
06:15:59.030 --> 06:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
have 30 months on our own service and
 
06:16:01.830 --> 06:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
which we routinely give uh deep sedation
 
06:16:03.868 --> 06:16:03.878 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia and our outpatients
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
clinics uh to any number of patients
 
06:16:08.948 --> 06:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
across all
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
demographics uh throughout that whole
 
06:16:13.628 --> 06:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
time in the
 
06:16:16.390 --> 06:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
same uh modality that we do it in
 
06:16:18.590 --> 06:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
private practice so we are literally
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
trained to do both of these things uh
 
06:16:23.548 --> 06:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
the rule changes one of the main
 
06:16:27.230 --> 06:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
concerns with d 304 is that it presented
 
06:16:29.310 --> 06:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
this Avenue that all of a sudden the
 
06:16:32.548 --> 06:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
board could come forward and just cut
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
off this access and make this drastic
 
06:16:37.468 --> 06:16:37.478 align:start position:0%
change uh a number of which those
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations were made by people that
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
have uh no background in anesthesia and
 
06:16:46.430 --> 06:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
so it it really created a lot of issues
 
06:16:48.230 --> 06:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
this bill the reason why we support uh
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 470 is that it uh kind of
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
protects that practice and that service
 
06:16:57.030 --> 06:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
that we provide by saying hey you just
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
got to follow National guidelines and uh
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know it serves the the data that
 
06:17:05.110 --> 06:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
backs up those guidelines as a opposed
 
06:17:07.190 --> 06:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
to being out on your own potentially and
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
having to explain that
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
so okay but that's uh I thank you for
 
06:17:18.110 --> 06:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
questions excellent thank you thank you
 
06:17:21.440 --> 06:17:27.070 align:start position:0%
questions excellent thank you thank you
Lori

06:17:27.070 --> 06:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:37.788 --> 06:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:40.350 --> 06:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record I'm Lori Rosado
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
I reside here in conquer and I'm a
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
practicing general dentist here in
 
06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
conquer uh thank you representatives for
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak a lot of what I had
 
06:17:51.390 --> 06:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
to say has already been spoken and so I
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat the process it's in
 
06:17:55.390 --> 06:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
my testimony so what I will do instead
 
06:17:57.670 --> 06:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
is talk to you about from my perspective
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
as a general
 
06:18:01.070 --> 06:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
dentist as a general dentist I'll give
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
you an example child comes in in the
 
06:18:05.110 --> 06:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
morning mother calls my child child is
 
06:18:09.070 --> 06:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
swollen infected they get into my chair
 
06:18:11.628 --> 06:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
I evaluate the child usually a child
 
06:18:14.190 --> 06:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
like that is crying in pain needs to be
 
06:18:16.830 --> 06:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
sedated as a general dentist we don't do
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we refer to an oral surgeon at that
 
06:18:21.750 --> 06:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
point my team calls the oral surgery
 
06:18:24.510 --> 06:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
practice we have several in the state
 
06:18:26.948 --> 06:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
that are excellent here in Conger we
 
06:18:29.628 --> 06:18:29.638 align:start position:0%
have several we call the oral surgeons
 
06:18:31.910 --> 06:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
practice tell them it's an emergency
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
situation we can't leave the child
 
06:18:35.230 --> 06:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
swollen like this
 
06:18:37.948 --> 06:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
they will accommodate us they'll get the
 
06:18:39.868 --> 06:18:39.878 align:start position:0%
child into their chair within a few
 
06:18:42.430 --> 06:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
hours so if you picture the time frame
 
06:18:44.310 --> 06:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'm assessing in the morning they get to
 
06:18:46.190 --> 06:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
the oral surgeon hopefully by early
 
06:18:48.868 --> 06:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon the oral surgeon assesses them
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
and makes a decision can I sedate this
 
06:18:53.070 --> 06:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
child or there's the someone that I
 
06:18:54.990 --> 06:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
would have to bring to the O in the
 
06:18:57.788 --> 06:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
cases where they can Sate which are many
 
06:19:00.750 --> 06:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
they can safely sedate a child right now
 
06:19:02.990 --> 06:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
take care of the infection either
 
06:19:05.430 --> 06:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
provide IV antibiotics we're given the
 
06:19:07.548 --> 06:19:07.558 align:start position:0%
antibiotics they need to go home with
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the child is safely treated and the
 
06:19:11.670 --> 06:19:11.680 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
06:19:14.548 --> 06:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
done if this bill doesn't pass or if the
 
06:19:18.070 --> 06:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
rules change happen that oral surgeon
 
06:19:21.390 --> 06:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
has to find o time at 3 o'clock in the
 
06:19:25.150 --> 06:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon or in the that time frame and
 
06:19:26.990 --> 06:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
now we look at can that child be treated
 
06:19:29.190 --> 06:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
today if the child can't be treated that
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
day they have to be admitted to the
 
06:19:34.708 --> 06:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
hospital extra costs IV antibiotics and
 
06:19:37.990 --> 06:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the hospital extra costs wait for o
 
06:19:41.270 --> 06:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
time extra costs all
 
06:19:43.310 --> 06:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary we know these children can
 
06:19:44.868 --> 06:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
be safely treated here we've been doing
 
06:19:47.910 --> 06:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
it for decades so I as a proponent of
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
the bill speaking from the general
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
dentist Community I ask that you guys
 
06:19:57.390 --> 06:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
questions apparently not thank you very
 
06:20:05.548 --> 06:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:05.558 --> 06:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
director

06:20:18.070 --> 06:20:18.080 align:start position:0%

us thank you I I think that the the only
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
possible implication might be that the
 
06:20:51.270 --> 06:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners might need to
 
06:20:53.350 --> 06:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
look at their rules again if it were to
 
06:20:54.910 --> 06:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
pass is that
 
06:20:56.708 --> 06:20:56.718 align:start position:0%

06:21:28.350 --> 06:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:31.430 --> 06:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
what yeah it's 4:00 so yeah let's do
 
06:21:33.310 --> 06:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
this one at
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
least see with those all right I think
 
06:21:39.030 --> 06:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
the committee will go into executive
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:51.350 --> 06:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:54.750 --> 06:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
SL ah well that case let's uh we'll
 
06:21:57.670 --> 06:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
definitely quit before
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
five Indian one most of the questions
 
06:22:02.230 --> 06:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
were people on the Pion subcommittee so
 
06:22:03.230 --> 06:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
if we would have send it to my
 
06:22:05.670 --> 06:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
subcomittee we were the I would have to
 
06:22:09.868 --> 06:22:09.878 align:start position:0%
like now okay um should I can you wait
 
06:22:11.270 --> 06:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
two minutes five minutes I think this
 
06:22:12.670 --> 06:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
one's going to be
 
06:22:12.680 --> 06:22:14.190 align:start position:0%
one's going to be
easy

06:22:14.190 --> 06:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
easy
 
06:22:14.200 --> 06:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
easy
okay

06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:22:18.628 --> 06:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
um since we have people that will that
 
06:22:20.590 --> 06:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
have longer commutes than many of us
 
06:22:22.510 --> 06:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
only this spill I think we will only do
 
06:22:24.910 --> 06:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
this spill I just fake does someone have
 
06:22:27.548 --> 06:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
a moot have a motion Madame chair I move
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
a to pass on H Bill 470 I'll second okay
 
06:22:33.430 --> 06:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
move by representative groa second by
 
06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lon
 
06:22:37.708 --> 06:22:37.718 align:start position:0%

06:22:37.718 --> 06:22:40.350 align:start position:0%
uh do you wish to speak to your
motion

06:22:40.350 --> 06:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:22:43.670 --> 06:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes I do I'm very concerned that any T
 
06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
any changes in the rules that would make
 
06:22:50.708 --> 06:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
access stricter and reduce accessibility
 
06:22:55.150 --> 06:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
to treatment for anyone who needs um
 
06:22:59.270 --> 06:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
oral surgery is a concern to us and I
 
06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
would um hope that the committee would
 
06:23:04.990 --> 06:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
have been motivated by the testimony
 
06:23:06.310 --> 06:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
that they've heard
 
06:23:09.110 --> 06:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
today thank you representable Anne um
 
06:23:10.750 --> 06:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I believe that
 
06:23:11.990 --> 06:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is critical to make sure that we
 
06:23:13.468 --> 06:23:13.478 align:start position:0%
can protect access and protect the
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
health of our youngest residents and so
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to support this any
 
06:23:21.350 --> 06:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
