maximum ability to absorb any additional

cost downshifted from state government
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
frankly they've had it citizens are
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
paying attention and recognize that the
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
school and Municipal portions of the
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
property tax bills they receive that
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
come due every June and December are
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
increasing because the state is
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
downshifting Municipal and education
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
cost to property
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers this compounds the unavoidable
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
increases local school districts and
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to include for cost

downshifted from the state to
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities for things like the New

Hampshire retirement system citizens
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to live within a budget and do not
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
have the luxury of being able to
 
00:09:52.829 --> 00:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
downshift their cost to anyone else any
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's highways to the towns in
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
which they are located is another
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
example of the State trying to pass the
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
buck or should I say pass the bill for
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
its responsibilities to municipalities
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
and their citizens it is time for those
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
in state government to realize that its
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
budget decisions to date have created a
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
situation whereby property tax burdens
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
have surpassed citizens ability to pay
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
and residents cannot bear a single other
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
increase to their property tax bills
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%

ones that each of you
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
represent if the state feeling an EP an
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
economic pinch and revenues are short
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
should suddenly decide to unload
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility for its Highway property
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
on to a municipality at will even if the
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
local select board or Town Council
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
opposes such action on behalf of
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
impacted taxpayers discontinuing

highways to the town or city in which it

is located solves a problem for the
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
state but creates a much larger problem

for

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
would that be and what would be next as
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
it is our duty and obligation to
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for the best interests of the

00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'd like to
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%

name is Wendy Thomas and I represent the
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
town of marac um a state road by
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
definition is used by everyone it's not
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
used by just people in the town however
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
allocating the state road to the town
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
makes the town responsible for all of
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
the costs uh representative Murphy did a
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
good job of explaining the problem um
 
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:03.240 align:start position:0%
all I will say is that disposing of
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
state roads will have a huge impact to
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
our town as this would be a huge impact
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
to any town please know that it's
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
threatening us today and it could happen
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
rung thank you very much Mr chair for
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
the record my name is rosem Marie rang
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm a representative of Hillsboro 12
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
um I want to kind of remind those of you
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
who are in uh not in your freshman year
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
but uh if you were here last year the um
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
the house the Senate and the governor
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
signed into law it was um Senate Bill
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
539 and I want to read part of that bill
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
because it um already establishes a
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
president for requiring a governing a
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
governing body to approve transfer of
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
Assets in this bill it says upon notice
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
by the department the governing body
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
shall cause the legislative body to
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
answer the question of whether the
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislative body wants to accept the
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership of the dam at the
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
same meeting the legislative body shall
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
consider the issuance of any long-term
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
debt necessary to effectuate the
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
transfer and address any deficiencies if
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
the legislative body votes to accept the
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
transfer but denies issuance of the debt
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
the department shall consider that to be
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
a rejection of the offer so we've
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
already approved in this state a process
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
for transferring State assets in Senate
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
Bill 539 it has to do with a a dam but
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill has to do with roads and it
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that this bill was
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
passed we need to pass um I mean the
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
same reasons that Senate Bill 539 was
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
passed we have to pass this bill because
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
as was previous previously
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
stated no town or city in this state
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
should have to assume a tremendous cost
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
for something that provides value to the
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
entire state so um I'd like you to
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
consider an TP motion on this bill and
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
again if you want to read what we've
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
already done please uh check out Senate

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
should know better um I'm uh currently
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
chairman of the marac Town Council and
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm here this morning just to elucidate
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
what we've had to uh deal with uh with
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
um the downshifting of the section of
 
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
high state owned roadway called
 
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
Continental Boulevard in our town um a
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
few years ago there was uh um amendments
 
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
to legislation to add this uh release of
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
this road to marac and it was in gu to
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
save money for the State of New
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which I appreciate that desire
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
but it becomes a downshifting situation
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh the segment that the state owns is
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
about two miles long and the cost to
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
maintain that roadway All Things
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
Considered um would be costing the town
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
of marac about
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year um we we didn't like
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
that the what uh we will be receiving
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
this road in four more years I believe
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
it was 2029 they did pass it this past
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
year as an amendment to to the uh
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe was part of the budget but
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh the only the good good thing for
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
marac is that this is a road that serves
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
as a u a release for r 101a that travels
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh from Route 101 and I believe it's
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
Milford to nashwa and 101a is was very
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
congested when they built a Continental
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
Boulevard um Exit 8 had been constructed
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
to relieve the traffic on 101a and
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
Continental Boulevard was for the same
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
reason the only good thing for marac is
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
that when this does become our road we
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
can shut it down and that difficulty for
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
the town city of Nashville will be great
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe it will be taken back by
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
the state if not sooner it's a road that
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
is a Causeway that gets people from 101a
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
to the ever Turnpike and I'm asking you
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
to support this legislation thank you
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
mcau welcome to public
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
works good morning Mr chairman honorable
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
board members thank you for letting me
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
speak to House Bill 561 while I'm here
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
as the town manager of merac I believe
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill will affect the entire
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
State as a community who is going to be
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
given New Hampshire dot maintain Road in
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
the future I do not want to see this
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
happen to any other community in the
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
state currently to repave Continental
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
Boulevard just that 2 Mile Stretch dot
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
million the fiscal impacts that this
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
will have on the town is anywhere
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
between 2 cents New Hampshire dot uh
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
estimates versus our 10-cent estimate of
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
$500,000 like like the state the town is
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
struggling with budget we know that as
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions as it relates to
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
Public Safety roads and bridges solid
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
waste and the general needs versus wants
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
community I am sure I am not the only
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
Community dealing with these issues
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
however even a two-cent increase to some
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
of our residents is too much you will
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
see support from the bill from a number
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues who could not be here
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
today please do not let this happen to
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
any other community it already happened
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
to Newington and now marac and it's a
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
troubling precedent that is being set
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
that nhdot can just reclassify a road
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
and give it to a
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
community I do want to leave you with
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
final thoughts I want you to imagine
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
that if there's roads in your state that
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do or your town or
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
community that New Hampshire do
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
maintains if they just reclassified it
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
to your community what will that do what
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
will that do to the constituents in your
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
party in your in your area once again I
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you sir is there any
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative jurus thank
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for being here
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
today in the uh in the turnover to the
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
from the from the state DOT to the town
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
of meramac in that agreement is the
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
state not is the state going to repave
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
that section of Continental Boulevard we
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
have no details of what the state plans
 
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
to do or not do in that section this was
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference that came up
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
with this decision um it was uh run
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
through boards um the committee of
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
conference came up in the last minute um
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
one of the uh state senators came up
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
with this consideration and it was
 
00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
accepted by the committee of conference
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh we do not have any details of what
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
dot plans to do in that area I do know
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
that there are several culverts that
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
probably need to be be replaced there
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
are three or four traffic lights in that
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
area that are getting old in the tooth
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
one of them's been updated the other two
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
have not it's a two mile section of Road
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
um there
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
are uh very few if any opportunities on
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
that road considering uh and through
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
that road section there is a penchuk
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
Waterworks which is n Nash's water
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
supply that owns several acres of land
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh Fidelity Investments own several
 
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
acres of land so there is no
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
development uh in that area that
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
potentially can go on be in that Two
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
Mile Stretch for the town to help offset
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
the cost and unless penchuk sells their
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
property or Fidelity sells some of their
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
land which I do not see happening in the
 
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.190 align:start position:0%
land which I do not see happening in the
near

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
near
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
future okay one more real I'll please
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks again
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
and the state the the the turnpike
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
remove the tolls uh from that area what
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
10 years ago to relieve citizens of
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
maramag correct uh I don't believe it
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
was 10 years ago it was it was it was
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
several years ago but I don't know if it
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
was 10 years I don't not have the exact
 
00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.149 align:start position:0%
was 10 years I don't not have the exact
date

00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you thank you any further
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions saying none Mr chair I'm sorry
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative cler thank you very much
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh you referred to something the town of
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
Newington and another Community where
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
the dot basically forced the communities
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
to accept the reclassified what was the
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
other community it's marac and Newington
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
marac and okay all right Newton do you
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
remember Newington when that happened I
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
could always ask doot but was curious um
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
happened in the early 2000s 2010 um my
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
colleague uh um did mention it and there
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
was uh some back and forth uh they hire
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
Consultants to do studies and there was
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
an agreement um that happened between
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
the state and uh Newton where they
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
replaced and repaved and did a bunch of
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
other things to get the road back but
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier that uh there was
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
none of that discussion with the town of
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
marac they're just giving us the road
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%

you've just heard I'm Steve Leon I'm
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation I uh currently serve as
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
the legislative liaison some of you may
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
remember my predecessor Kathy M hampson
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
prior to this I served for seven years
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
in the Bureau of right of way uh I have
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
my colleague Eric Sergeant here who is
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
now the current administrator of right
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
of way I am the former administrator of
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
right of way and the Bureau of right of
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
way is really it's the real estate
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
section of the Department of
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation we're responsible for
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
acquiring property
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
for Highway projects we're also
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for doing um disposal of
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
surplus property and also we do we do
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
discontinuance of Highway RightWay when
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
necessary and we do play a role in
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
reclassifying um reclassifying highways
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
from a class one or two to a class five
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
when it's
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so one thing I want to
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
point out is is with the bill it talks
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
about and and we don't we're here to
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
provide background information as to how
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
the department uses the statutes that
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
are being proposed to be
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
amended one thing I will say is highways
 
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
do not um highways that are in active
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
use are not Surplus property so we
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be disposing of them under 4
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
colon 39c for colon
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
39f or 440 because if it's an active use
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
it can't be
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
Surplus so what we would do in a
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
situation like that if it were deemed um
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
to be so if if the highway section
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't being used anymore we might
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
consider doing a discontinuance under
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 230 colon uh 55 through um colon 62
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
and what happens with the
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
discontinuance most of the time and and
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
in my time at Right Way
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
um it's usually done when a project will
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
move an
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
intersection and
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
then the old roaded doesn't just go away
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
it has to actually be formally
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
discontinued because it was laid out by
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
a governmental entity and then it has to
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
be discontinued through that process so
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
the commissioner May identify that often
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
times what happens like happened in
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
barington is a property owner will come
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
to us because they bought a piece of
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
property project happened 40 years ago
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no more asphalt there there's
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
trees growing out of it but when they
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
went to get their their permitting they
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
realized that there's a highway that
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
runs right across the where their
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
proposed front lawn's going to be so
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
they'll approach the department this
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
happened at the intersection of Route
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
202 and 126 in barington um where we had
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
a former project many years ago but that
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
section never got discontinued so we
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
went through the discontinuing process
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
for this property owner that is how a a
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
um a discontinuance typically Works in
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
that process we approach the T we have
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
to notify the town the town has 60 days
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
to act and then if they if the town does
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
nothing that section automatically
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
reverts back reverts to the town but if
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh if they do they hold a hearing they
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
find that there that that section of
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
Road cannot be used for municipal
 
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
Highway purposes so then we go through
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
the process um of doing that and I will
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
point out the statutory scheme provides
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
for uh a um damaged property owner to
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
bring a claim against the department for
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
damages so that's typically how that
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
works um so then we get into reclass
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
ification now I from the testimony I
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
heard and I I'll admit I'm not all that
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with Continental bulevard uh
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
with marac but what I heard from the
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
testimony today that wasn't done by the
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
transportation that was done as a as an
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
um as an act of legislation so I'm I'm
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
not sure the background there typically
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
a good example of
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
reclassification is Enterprise Drive in
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
Windom if you're traveling south on 9 93
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
and you see you're at Exit 3 you see
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a large clock tower there that's
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
the end of Enterprise Drive that was
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
formerly Route
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
111 uh back before we went in there and
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
reconstructed that but after we bypass
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
that section of Route 111 it serves just
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
a local population so it takes on the
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
character of a local Road um and um so
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
that in that case that was reclassified
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
to a class five highway now the town of
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Windam maintains it uh I will say there
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
was some discussion earlier about an
 
00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:39.710 align:start position:0%
was some discussion earlier about an
unfunded

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
mandate the town of Nelson case uh the
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled on that and found
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and determined that it it is not an
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and the road does get
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
acted to the BL ramp money the town and
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
Nelson case involves route um Route 99
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
202 in Nelson back in the 90s the
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
department went in there reconstructed
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
it bypassed sections of Route 9202 that
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
are down by Granite Lake Area there and
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
um reclassified it to a class five town
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
of Nelson took the state to court and it
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
determined the the uh the Supreme Court
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
settled the question that it wasn't an
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate so um with that that's
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
how we work our concern here would be
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
that if you take that Authority away
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner to
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
reclassify roads and I will say at the
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
seven years I was at the attorney I mean
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
seven years I've been with the
 
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
seven years I've been with the
Department

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not aware that
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
reclassification occurring in that time
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
frame uh it's not something we do often
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's done it's only
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's typically done when these
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
when the these projects come in they
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
bypass a section of Road however there's
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
still Property Owners on that road
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
there's still residents on that road
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
that still need that road to access
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
their property there it takes on the uh
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
takes on the character of a local road
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
so I if this if this Authority was taken
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
away from the commissioner what you'd
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
end up with is little bits and sections
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
all around the state that are basically
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
local roads where where where the
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
department is going to be tasked with
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
their maintenance and uh you know
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
they're no longer part of the state
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
transportation system so again the
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
maintenance um priorities are going to
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
be those main roads so I'm happy to take
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
any questions that um any members of the
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
committee may have any questions
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative cluer okay thank you Mr
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%

00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
state supreme court decision about
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
involving the town I want to say it's
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
around 99 or 2000 I can uh if you'd like
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to look that case up you
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
could and the committee any information
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
with the chair's permission I'd
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%

Newman yes thank you Mr lebante I don't
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
believe I heard anything about the town
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
of Newington that was mentioned in
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
previous testimony I heard uh Nelson
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
barington do you hear have any
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
information about what yeah when we went
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
through and we did that that Turnpike
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
project there was a section of it uh I'm
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
looking back at my colleague that
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
Woodbury you said yes Woodbury Road in
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
that area and it was reclass it again
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
took on the nature of a um class a class
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
five highway so it was reclassified as
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
project to a class five Highway and
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
again that as it was testified to
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
earlier it was a around in the early
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
2000s when that
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
happened seeing no further questions
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
lante at this point in time we will
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on house
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:56.710 align:start position:0%

with my legislative colleagues speaking
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
about the increased feat noise that is
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
currently permeating these neighborhoods
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
and impacting the quality of life of the
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
people who reside in these
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods both Paul and Finley live
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
along the feet and can speak anecdotally
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
about the noise creep in their
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
respective neighborhoods It is believed
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
within my community that sound from feet
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
will only worsen upon its
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
completion as an offer of proof it is
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
generally accepted that an ambient noise
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
decibel level in excess of
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
66 DB that's an important number 66
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
DB is excessive and in need of abatement
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
there is a 29 nhdot environmental study
 
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:42.440 align:start position:0%
to which noise analysis was performed
 
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.270 align:start position:0%
to which noise analysis was performed
and

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.910 align:start position:0%
and
identified

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
17 miramac neighborhoods along the feet
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
with decibel levels greater than
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
70 greater than the federal standards
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
70 but included only four neighborhoods
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
for noise mitigation within the scope of
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
the feat project that leaves 13

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
uncovered NH Do's rationale for not
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
including these 13 neighborhoods into
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
the feat widening project ties into
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
their 2016 noise policy which factors
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
density into their sound barrier
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
criteria nhdot acknowledges that while
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
the ambient noise is excessive in these
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods noise abatement cannot be
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
provided because sound barrier
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
construction wouldn't reasonably Abate
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
the noise based upon the density
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
criteria within the nhdot t's noise
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
policy as such I respectfully disagree
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
with the hd's noise policy and their
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
assertion that neighborhood noise
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
abatements cannot be accomplished for
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
these 13 affected miramac
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods consequently House Bill
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
578 is a bill of action that will
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
provide noise relief to the
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods along the
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
feet in conclusion I urge favorable
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 578 to quell the
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Mooney and I understand
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
you have another bill to present
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so I'm going to forgo any
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions for you seeing as you
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
basically just had representative Boyd's
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
testimony so thank you for coming I
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Mr chairman being
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
sensitive of my time thank
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman thank you thank
 
00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
you for recognizing me next I appreciate
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
it it's a full day for all of
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
us full evening as well it's budget
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
budget committee day in marac I'm
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Tim MCU I represent District 11
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
which includes the communities of marac
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
Milford Amer and Wilton and I'm here
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the residents of
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
marac in support of House Bill 57 8 if
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
it were only just the feet and the
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
pitter patter of little feet and not the
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
deafening Highway noise yes feet stands
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
for f ever Turnpike as I'm sure you all
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
know by
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
now but the only thing more deafening
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
than the highway noise are the calls and
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
emails that all of the legislators of
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
this District have been getting due to
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
the unexpected and yes I do say
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
unexpected I lived on back Rover Road at
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
one point and I can tell you we never
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
could have possibly predicted the
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
deafening level of noise and I lived on
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
side at one point we could not have
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
possibly predicted I we did know of
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
course that eventually there would be
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
improvements to this infrastructure I
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
commuted South to Boston into Wakefield
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we knew that the route
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
three would be widened and someday
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
progress wouldn't be impeded but it
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
would it was most definitely impossible
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
to predict
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
the level of clear cutting right up to
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
the edge of the
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
property these individuals some were had
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
foresight sold their
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
properties moved away and were lucky
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
enough to get out from underneath their
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
Investments but I'm here for these
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
residents experiencing unexpected
 
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
impacts from the highway noise following
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
the recent Highway construction no one
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
could have expected what they are
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
enduring on a daily basis in their
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
backyards House Bill 578 seeks to
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
address these concerns by creating a
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
noise sound barrier going beyond the
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
typical guidelines so why should we do
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we do have guidelines these
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines have evolved over the years
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
they certainly are different than when
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
some of these longtime residents
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
properties so in standard Highway
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
projects as I'm sure you all know there
 
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
are usual formulas and measurements that
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
have served us well yet our current
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
situation does call for some flexibility
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
in protecting these communities from
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
this excessive
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
noise there are clear precedents that
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
exists in New Hampshire demonstrating a
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
commitment to address the community
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
cerns even when strict formulas fall
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
short for example during other budget
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
years yep it's a budget year I know in
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
2016 budget year the New Hampshire
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%

they prioritized public well-being over

parameters to manage unexpected noise
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
asking you to do the same
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
thing mayor M res residents face a
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
particularly challenging situation
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
recent Highway construction has
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
introduced a level of noise intrusion
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
unanticipated by traditional planning
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%

00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
they might be staying indoors right now
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
we all might be staying indoors when
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's Sub-Zero out but they want to go
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
outside and enjoy their fire pits mow
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
their lawns in peace plant their Gardens
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
and they can't do it homeowners that are
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
enduring this Sudden Change deserve the
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
special consideration that this
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
delegation is asking for they would like
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
you to help them preserve the quiet
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
enjoyment they've long expected and long
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
enjoyed I'm asking you to act outside
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
the norm in this
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
instance and recognize that rigid
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
adherence to the formulas sometimes
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
overlooks the human
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
element an element fueling Community
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
value and upholding property owner
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
rights listening to the residents
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
recount experiences of sleepest nights
 
00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
drained relationships and declining
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
property Market values enforces the
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
urgency of this matter in communities
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
like ours noise is not merely a nuisance
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
it is a threat to the quality of life
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
and economic stability so if we rely on
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
past alternative approvals We Trust
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
local input we understand the immediate
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
and long-term consequences of increased
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
Highway noise we can together create a
 
00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
solid foundation for you to vote House
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 578 ought to pass send it over to
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
me in the Senate and I'll take care of
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
it from there I hope I think I can do
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
that for you legislators should act now
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
to provide timely relief we hope that a
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
flexible approach in permitting noise
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
barriers will help protect residents and
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
preserve their property value even when
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessary to to depart from the
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
standard criteria and I realize that's a
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
tall ask but it's been done before not
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
once but at least twice in budget years
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
so I respectfully urge you Mr chairman
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
and your committee to support House Bill
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%

that the highway needs to be expanded we
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
understand the increased traffic in our
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
town and the headaches that go along
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
we understand that this will require
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
patience on our part we get it but what
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
we don't understand is why our homes
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
where we live where we raise our
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
families are not being considered for
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
quality of life protections as a result
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
of this expansion especially when data
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
indicates that there is a direct impact
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
this bill makes sense go ahead and
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
expand the highway go ahead and do it we
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
agree with it but if it impacts the
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%

town of March um here to speak in favor
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
568 um HB 568 is a bill important to
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
Mary many Mary Mach residents whose
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
lives and peace have been negatively
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
impacted by the necessary expansion of
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
the fever turnpike I think we'd all
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
agree including the homeowners that have
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
been negatively impacted in the process
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
that the turnpike needed to be expanded
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
that said some residents have been
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
unfairly burdened by this expansion in
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
terms of increased road noise at all
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
times of the day and night they have
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
reported disruptions to their sleep
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
diminished ability to have conversations
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
outside and this is still winter
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
impacted View and exposure of their
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
homes to the roadway I'm here to support
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
impacted residents who seek a return to
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
the quality of life that will keep them
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the fef return Pike is
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
a thorough Affair for people from out of
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
state to visit and spend their tourism
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
dollars here in the granite state and
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens to travel far
 
00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:04.990 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens to travel far
and

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
wide Turnpike improvements however
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
should not come at the qual at the
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
expense of diminished quality of life
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
for residents among that along that
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
route though I understand that this
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
committee will be voting on the policy
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
of building sound barriers barriers and
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
not the fiscal note I recognize that
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
building sound barriers also comes at a
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
cost to the state if the state had
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
placed tolls at the border and along the
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
most highly traveled areas of the
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
turnpike many years ago the revenue
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
collected by user fees would have been
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
more than enough to cover the cost of
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
sound barriers along the highway where
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
they're necessary given the budget
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
challenges New Hampshire's facing taking
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
such action even today remind remains an
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
option for consideration to help fund
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate sound barriers for the area
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
identified HB 568 would help alleviate a
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
problem that we can and should solve on
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of our citizens I ask that you
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues have previously stated I get
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of calls from my neighbors in
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
miramac um regarding the sound and I my
 
00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
home actually AB buts one of the
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods um Vista Way and Round
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
Tree which are listed in the bill and
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
this summer I happened to to walk down
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
the street and it was unbearable um I
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
know this is only antidotal but but I
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
would think that the measurements if
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
they were taken today would show a much
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
increased impact than when this project
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
was first um planned back in the um it
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
had to have been like 2014
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
2015 um and there are flaws in those
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
measurements um I think uh in in two two
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
sources I think are true one is that
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
with the clear cutting of trees that
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
have been done in in preparation for the
 
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
additional lanee um the sound has
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
increased substantially and I I suspect
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
that the role that trees plays in
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
dampening sound was
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
underestimated during the initial
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
measurements because without those trees
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's very loud also in
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
the measurements it assumes that people
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
are only entertaining or spending time
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
outdoors in their backyards many of
 
00:53:59.710 --> 00:53:59.720 align:start position:0%
these homes face the highway and many
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
people entertain in their front yards
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
they may have porches or they may have
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
more property in their front yard where
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
they could put up a tent or a fire pit
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
or do
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
entertaining um but when I had a
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with someone who's working
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
on this project they said no we
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
calculate the impact point is on the
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
other side of the house and I don't
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
really believe that that should be true
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
many many people when they come and go
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
from their home they're they're entering
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
from their front door from the front of
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
the house to to get to their car so I I
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
really think that we need to examine how
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
we take those measurements and I think
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
um what I consider the flawed way is
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
what led to the decision that these
 
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods don't deserve to have
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
sound barriers and I want um there was
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
actually in the planning stages there
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
was a neighborhood um off of Clay Street
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
it it's um it's a little bit south of
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
the neighborhoods that are um identified
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
in this bill but they disagreed with the
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
measurement they hired their own sound
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
engineer who showed that it was
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
mismeasured and the state did add that
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhood to their plans and I really
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be up to um having
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
um people in a neighborhood having to
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
raise their own money to hire a sound
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
engineer to correct the measurement of
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
the state so that's another concern I
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
have and uh get to to represent of
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
jurist's point when he brought up the
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
whole issue of tolls the ever Turnpike
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
is a Turnpike it relies on user fees to
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
fund its maintenance repairs and any
 
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.510 align:start position:0%
fund its maintenance repairs and any
capital

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
projects the first 21 miles of that
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
Turnpike has no user fees um from the
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
state line of Massachusetts up until the
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
Bedford tolls people use that that
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
Turnpike freely without contributing any
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
costs the busiest part of that Turnpike
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
is in Nashua where the where the state
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
has invested tens of millions of dollars
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
for a new bridge to Hudson for exit
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
ramps for increased lanes and there were
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
plans for a toll booth there and there's
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
even a tunnel that goes underneath the
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
turnpike to accommodate that and yet
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
that I don't know the history of that
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
but that was cancelled and the state so
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
the state did realize years ago that
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
they needed to charge user fees for to
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
the users and yet and with all due
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
respect to my colleagues from nashaa it
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
created such an unfair uh situation and
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
a great burden was placed on the people
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
of miramac for decades where they were
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
paying for all of that use from exit
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
ramp tolls so I would like to have the
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee um to support support this
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
bill 578 um and I think that in in the
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
future is particularly as you start
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the 10-year Transportation
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
plan to incorporate fairness in the way
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we fund our turnpikes they are
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to be self-funded but there
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
there is such an imbalance of Burden um
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
and if it was fair the the money to
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
erect these sound barriers would be able
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
to be covered easily with the that toll
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue so thank you very much I'd be
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you any
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you Mr chairman for
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
allowing me to ask my question and thank
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question if I
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
understood correctly and I could have
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted what you were saying uh
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that where we collect in order to help
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
pay for some of this stuff because
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
that's outside of where the toll start
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
should we move the tolls closer to the
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh state line is that what's being
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
indicated so that we could gather the
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
funds to help pay for these sound
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
barriers I I agree um you know a
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
Turnpike is user fee funded and if I'm
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
going to use the turnpike
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
I I I would think that it's reasonable
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
that I should help pay for that I don't
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
believe people in the North country or
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
people on on the Sea Coast should pay
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
for a Turnpike because we've defined
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
that as a Turnpike it's not a state road
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
under do it's under the turnpike system
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
I believe it's fair to expect people
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
that are using it to pay for it and
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's why tolls were proposed at the
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
state line at exit I think it was around
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
Spit Brook Road um if you drive down
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
that way you can see that there were
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
toll boost plan the road is very wide
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
around there um people in the know know
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
about the tunnel um but it was cancelled
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
at the last minute um I don't like I
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
said I don't know the history of that
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
but that was a Fair Way of collecting
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
user fees from users to pay for what
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
using representative Melvin thank
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
takeing my question thank you for taking
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
my question could you tell me how many
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
residents that
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
affects oh in the neighborhoods outlined
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
here I don't have a specific number
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
thousands I would say and I also think
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know I know representative money
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
when she was sharing representative
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
Boyd's testimony they talked about the
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
density factor and um anecdotally I know
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are plans for some residents to
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
have accessory dwelling units an in-law
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
apartment something similar to that and
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
so I think if we're just looking at
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
single family homes that's not an
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
accurate reflection of density because
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
it may
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
underestimate the actual number of
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
residents that might be in a single
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
family home if you know what I
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
me thank you very
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you very
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
much I'd like to please recognize
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative Julie miles next please
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to public
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
works thank you very much Mr chairman
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
and thank you members of the committee
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Julie miles
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
and I represent the of marac uh in an
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
effort not to be redundant I will keep
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
this very brief um I am a legislator
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
committed to the well-being of our
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
constituents and I'm here to advocate
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
for the installation of sound barriers
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
along the Everett Turnpike in marac I
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
understand that previous assessments
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
concluded that marac didn't meet the
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
necessity criteria for the sound barrier
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
installation along that portion however
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that the
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
environmental conditions are not static
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
with ongoing development increasing
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes noise levels are likely
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
to rise potentially surpassing the
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
established thresholds in the very near
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
future proactively addressing this issue
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
now will prevent further degradation of
 
01:01:15.549 --> 01:01:15.559 align:start position:0%
our residents quality of life it's also
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
worth noting that communities have been
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
granted sound barrier protection in
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
other similar
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances and for instance Bedford
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
just town the turnpike has been
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
benefited from some sound mitigation
 
01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
measures to relieve its residents
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
distress the people of marac deserve the
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
same consideration they did not choose
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
to have the turnp turnpike widened
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
although yes it was necessary they did
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
not choose to have a major highway
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
expansion bringing traffic closer to
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
their homes but now they are living with
 
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
the consequences and one of those is the
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
lack of privacy as you're driving along
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
the highway now some of those homes you
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
can see directly into their window
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
by supporting House Bill 578 we can take
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
a proactive step to ensure marac
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
citizens are afforded the same
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
protections as those in neighboring
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
communities waiting for conditions to
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
further deteriorate before taking action
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
would be a disservice to the families
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
who have already endured this much I
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to consider the
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
involving environmental factors and
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
precedent set by other towns to support
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
be House Bill 578 for the well-being of
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
none I would like to
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
works thank you again Mr chair honorable
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
members thank you for letting me speak
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 578 as you know I am the
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
town manager of marac I have lived on
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
the F Turnpike for 31 years I bought my
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
home knowing the property backs into the
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
turnpike over the last 31 years the
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
noise coming from the P Pike has
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
increased whether it's trucks using J
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
brakes motorcycles racing up and down
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
the F Turnpike Public Safety Sirens or
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
just cars with high performance Ms the
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
noise has
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
increased I live about,
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
1500 feet from the turnpike I have
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
several Acres of woods in between me and
 
01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
several Acres of woods in between me and
the

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
Turnpike my backyard now when I have my
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
dog out there I can not even hear her
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes barking because of the noise
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
on the turn
 
01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
bike I want to make you aware that I am
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
not personally benefiting from this bill
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
that request of the sound barriers as
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
you have heard town of March has 17
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods along the F of Turnpike
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
with noise analysts of over 70 DB but
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
only four of those neighborhoods have
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
had sound barriers in included in the
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
scope of the project identified in the
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
2019 report Nash marac Beford
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
13761 final environmental
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
study vist way was identified as one of
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
those areas that was well above the
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
decel level for the sound barrier at 74
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
however Vista Way did not meet the
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
barrier area per benefited receptor s
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
square foot of less than 1500 ft benefit
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
household in order to meet the cost
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness criteria Vista Way was was
 
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness criteria Vista Way was was
at

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:04:32.109 --> 01:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
3,654 or 2.43 times higher than the
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
threshold requirements that was
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
established in 2016 before covid I do
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a couple
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
questions is this a Federal Regulation
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
for sound barriers or is it a state
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
standard why are we using standards
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
established prior to covid as we all
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
know the world has changed since Co in
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
closing I have had residents tell me
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
that when they're walking in the Vista
 
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
Way area they have to turn the volume up
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
on their phones all the way and still
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
cannot hear the music or ebooks in their
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
earbuds I believe that there is a
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
quality of life issue that should be
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
taken in account for these neighborhoods
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
I also believe the sound will only get
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
worse once the fever Turnpike is widened
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and that tree buffer is diminished thank
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
you and if you have any questions I'd be
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
more than happy to try to answer
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
them thank you any
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you and
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
I would like to recognize the honorable
 
01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:33.670 align:start position:0%
I would like to recognize the honorable
John

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
Graham welcome to Public Works sir long
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
see thank you Mr chairman uh for the
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
record um I am John Graham I live in
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
Bedford and I represented the Bedford in
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
the house for a couple of decades
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I was chairman of this
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
committee I can answer a couple of the
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
questions I'll tell you why the Nash
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
toll was never uh built when they when
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
they was planned it was taken out the
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
same way the marac tolls have been taken
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
down through legislative action the
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
deputy speaker at the time was from
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
nashor and she convinced everybody in
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
the house that it was a bad idea to put
 
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
him right on the border so that answered
 
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.710 align:start position:0%
him right on the border so that answered
that

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
question what I have passed
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
out is a bill that I submitted when I
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
was chairman of this committee to do
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
sound barriers along one neighborhood in
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
Bedford uh tber Lane it was not the
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
first time uh now Senator Murphy worked
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
on it for a couple of years when he
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
represented Bedford in the um house it
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
was found inexpedient to legislate over
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
VI rejections because of the density
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
policy so if you want to consider this
 
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:03.630 align:start position:0%
policy so if you want to consider this
current

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill um in a favorable manner I ask that
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
you amend it to include tberry Lane and
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
I am sure that those on the Sea Coast
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
along the turnpike which is I95 the
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
Spalding and others would also like to
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
have sound barriers put up because they
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
have had separate bills in before to do
 
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.309 align:start position:0%
have had separate bills in before to do
sound

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
sound
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
barriers yeah it's going to be an
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
expense on the turnpike and I'll tell
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
you right now the turnpike is solvent
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
um truth and lending I I'm chairman of a
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
special commission set up by the by this
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
um legislature the general court to look
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
at funding of our Highway fund and
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
Turnpike fund we are having meetings on
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
that um so it's a long-term
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
problem if you're going to do
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
anything you've got to include everybody
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
you can't just have separate bills for
 
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.910 align:start position:0%
you can't just have separate bills for
separate

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
areas yeah um well I like to see T Lane
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
have uh their sound walls their decel
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
readings are higher than the ones that
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
are being reported from aramac so if
 
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to do that please do that
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
and remember that the turnpike system is
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
more than just the ever it is on the Sea
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
Coast as well um I think you all got a
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
briefing from dot on exactly what the
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
turnpike system was earlier
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
um last January uh so
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
please do what's right if you want to
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
turn this into a a committee to look at
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
what the policy is that's fine um but if
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
you order this out as ought to pass I
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
ask that it be ought to pass as amended
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
with not just tberry Lane but those um
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
areas on the other portion of the
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
turnpike over on the Sea Coast so that
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
we can find out what the true magnitude
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
of the problem is and I'll be TR I'll
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions Mr
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
Graham seeing none thank you very much
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
welcome and last but not least I like to
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
Evans good
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
morning my name is John Evans I'm the uh
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
noise program manager for the Department
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
of Transportation I have uh spoken with
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
some of many of you in the past um and
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to kind of provide a bit of
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
background and then uh possibly help
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the the comments or
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
questions that were brought up by the by
 
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.070 align:start position:0%
questions that were brought up by the by
previous

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the Department of
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh as part of the uh the
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
the environmental review process for the
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
ever Turnpike Expansion Project did
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
complete a noise study for the entire uh
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
length of the of the Turnpike Expansion
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
Project between the towns of NASA and uh
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
Bedford so that includes marac as well
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
as any of the the Gap what we call the
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
Gap sections um where the the turnpike
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
has effectively already been widened uh
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
through prior uh prior projects uh that
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
uh that study identified 25 separate
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
locations uh in need of
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
potential uh evaluation for potential
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
noise impacts of those um there were
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
noise impacts identified in 20 separate
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
locations uh throughout the corridor uh
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
and barriers were uh and and noise there
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
were noise impacts uh identified at
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 289 properties throughout
 
01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:16.830 align:start position:0%
approximately 289 properties throughout
the

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
corridor uh noise impacts as was stated
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
previously noise impacts are identified
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
as uh anything in excess of the the
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway noise abatement criteria
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
which in this case here uh is 66 DB the
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
reason 66 DB is used uh is because 66 DB
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
is the limit at which you know average
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
human speech um you know if if I'm
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
sitting having a conversation with you
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh face to face uh generally speaking
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
over an average hourly period 66 displ
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
would be the average over that period so
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
therefore noise levels in excess of 6 66
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
DB are considered to be an impact on on
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
the uh on on that area because the
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
ambient noise levels are louder and thus
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
it requires people to speak up to be
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
able to to have a
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
conversation um so when when the
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation with our
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
when we do complete one of these noise
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
evaluations we identify noise impacts
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
then the next step is to identify if
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's potential abatement measures
 
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
which can be implemented
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh to help alleviate those noise
 
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.870 align:start position:0%
uh to help alleviate those noise
levels

01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
um those typically come in the form of a
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
noise barrier or a burm you know amount
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
of dirt and the idea is being that if
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
you if you interrupt or place something
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
between the noise source and the area
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
you're trying to protect it will provide
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh noise reductions it will not
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate noise altogether it simply
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of noise um the
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
in so the department completed that
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
noise noise assessment and uh I should
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
add too that um when we determine noise
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
impacts we actually U it's a common
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
misconception that we complete noise um
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
we complete noise measurements at each
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
individual home we do not and the main
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
reason being is because we're actually
 
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
required by the Federal Highway
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
Administration for federal aid projects
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then we our policy um in order to be
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
fair and Equitable follows the same
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
process for the turnpike system as well
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
is to is to evaluate noise impacts that
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
would result from the project using
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
traffic noise levels that would that are
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
20 years out into the future upon
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
completion of the project so in this
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
case here noise impacts were identified
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
using uh you under the build conditions
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
of the project using uh traffic volumes
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
that would that are anticipated to exist
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the year 2 44 so it's important to
 
01:13:58.750 --> 01:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
note that some of the noise impacts that
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
were identified are those that which
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
have not yet been um been
 
01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:06.679 align:start position:0%
experienced uh but nonetheless in order
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
to identify if we uh to identify that we
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
are properly identifying noise impacts
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and uh it environmental impacts we
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
evaluated impacts throughout the
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire Corridor under
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
those conditions we then all then can
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
utilize that the the noise modeling um
 
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
software which is which is used by all
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
50 states to identify noise impacts and
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
potential abatement measures um to to
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
identify where where noise barriers
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
would be both feasible and
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable the the policy requires us to
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
identify feasibility and reasonable
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
because we there are certain
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances where placing a noise
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
barrier may not uh either be feasible
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
from an engine engineering standpoint it
 
01:14:58.110 --> 01:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
may not actually provide any benefits at
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
all or there may be some other uh say
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
environmental constraints or engineering
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
constraints that simply make it such
 
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
that you could not build a noise barrier
 
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
and provide any benefits and
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
reasonableness is and this is the one
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
that I think is is probably on was kind
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
of at the focus of prior testimony
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
relates to is it reasonable to build a
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
barrier some in some circumstances it uh
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
in order to build a noise barrier
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you may need a very large barrier and
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
it'll provide very little benefits the
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
department obviously uh resources are
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
are um you know restricted and so these
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
noise barriers are extremely expensive
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
um they cost upwards of $100 per square
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
foot of surface area essentially and um
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so in order for us to ensure that we
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
we are providing noise barriers at uh at
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
locations that are going to provide the
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
most benefit we have what's called a
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
reasonableness criteria the reasonable
 
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.590 align:start position:0%
reasonableness criteria the reasonable
criteria

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
includes um a a calculation which
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
essentially when you put into the noise
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
model um you can you can figure out how
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
many square feet of barrier you would
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
need to provide noise reductions at
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
impacted properties and some properties
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
that may not be impacted but would still
 
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:22.709 align:start position:0%
that may not be impacted but would still
be

01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
benefited um would receive noise
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
reductions that's what a benefit is and
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
um if there are uh so so we we put those
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
into the model and the model can predict
 
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
what the noise levels would be with that
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
barrier and you you kind of play around
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
with the the height and the length and
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
you identify the optimal barrier that
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be the barrier that provides the
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
most benefit for the least amount of
 
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
barrier um because that'll be the most
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
effective barrier essentially the effect
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
the department has an Effectiveness
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
criteria of, 1500 squ feet per benefited
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
receptor receptor being in for
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
residential areas that would be uh a
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
single family home or uh multif family
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
home if you if you have a multif family
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
home say with a duplex with two two then
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
then that would represent two
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
receptors um so so you take that the the
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
square footage of the barrier divide
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
that by the number of benefits and that
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
gives you the square foot per benefiting
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
home and if that number exce exceeds
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
1500 square ft per Ben
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
receptor then it's considered to be uh
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and and a noise barrier
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
would not be constructed at that
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
location uh of within the the uh
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
Corridor of the N marac Bedford project
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
there were um a total of of 13 locations
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
which were identified as
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
um as as as require you know where we
 
01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
have identified potential noise
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
abatement measures of those only seven
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
were found to be feasible and
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable all of those were as a result
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the um the the the effectiveness
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
criteria not being met uh and and that
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
is the case for Round Tree uh Round Tree
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
the Round Tree neighborhood as well as
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
the Back River Road neighborhood and and
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
again the main reason being there's not
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
we're not getting enough benefits to
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
provide uh to provide a barrier that's
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
considered reasonable in accordance with
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
the Department's noise policy I would
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
add that the Department's noise policy
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
that reasonableness criteria is required
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
by by all 50 states to have a
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
reasonableness criteria the department
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
does get to set that and the Departments
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh We've we've reviewed that in relation
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the other states and we're we're in
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
the the half of states that are
 
01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.830 align:start position:0%
the the half of states that are
uh

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
generally more barrier friendly on
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
construction there are other states that
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
have a much higher reasonableness
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
criteria and therefore more barrier
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
barriers are less likely to be
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
constructed in those States uh States
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
like Vermont and Maine are are among
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
those that have much higher requirements
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
and then there are other states say uh
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
like Maryland or uh uh Virginia and
 
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
whatnot that may have they that may have
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
provide more uh may have reasonableness
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
criterias that are lower and thus are
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
more likely to be um to to provide noise
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
abatement and again the the Department
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
of Transportation here in the state of
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're we're we're in the
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
middle of the road if not leaning
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
towards uh states that are that are more
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
commonly thought of as as being uh
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
states that that do pro allow for
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
barrier construction when when it's
 
01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable um so uh but I I would note
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
that of again there were there were 20
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
locations that were reviewed with noise
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
impacts and um and there were
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
various uh noise abatement measures that
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
were identified but again only seven of
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
those were identified as feasible and
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh those those seven locations alone are
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
going to require approximately $20
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
million $19 million uh to be in which
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
has been included and will be
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
constructed as part of this project if
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
we were to implement uh noise barriers
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
at the other remaining locations to be
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh that are that are impacted it would
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
require uh
 
01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.590 align:start position:0%
require uh
another

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
um an additional $24 million within just
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
this Corridor to uh to construct those
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
those additional noise barriers that do
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
not meet the department uh Department's
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
feasibility and reasonableness
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
criteria um so with that I'm sure that
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's probably some questions and I'd
 
01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
love to answer them uh and you know I
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
know I know everybody's time is valuable
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to open that
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr representative Jack uh
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
appearing uh we've heard several times
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
that we ought to adopt a policy that
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to throw away the density
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
criteria and just build them wherever
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
people think they need them what would
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway say if we did first of
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
all these are these standards are
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway standards not made up by
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
the do and what would they say if we
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
started to do that so uh it's important
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
to note that for this is this project is
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
a uh Turnpike funded project so in this
 
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
case here we don't need Federal approval
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
for for those types of projects on the
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
turnpike system but what we've tried
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
what we have done in order to be
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
Equitable across the entire
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation network of the State of
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is we've applied the same
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
policy that is required of the federal
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
federal government of Federal Highway
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
Administration uh AC to to the our
 
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
entire system of roadways regardless of
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're Turnpike funded
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
or uh federally funded in the case of If
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
This Were A Federal Road uh and we did
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
not have a noise
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
abatement criteria you know that that
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
reasonableness criteria we would not get
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
an approved noise uh policy and that
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
means we would not be able to construct
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
any projects uh on the on the federal
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
system within the state of New
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire using federal dollars further
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
brow thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
number of questions but if you could
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
just go back to what you just said about
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
if we exceed the benefit basically of
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
what we've agreed to the 1500 criteria Y
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
what was that reasoning we would not get
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds to do any other noise
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
abatement projects in the state is that
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
said so what you're saying is so
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what you're you're asking is
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have a Reas a
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
reasonableness having a reasonableness
 
01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
criteria is required of us in the
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations our noise policy
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
must adhere to all the requirements of
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
requirements um if our noise policy
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't comp comp with the requirements
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
within that within the Federal
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
Regulations then uh we would not have an
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
approved noise policy and we would not
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
be able to seek environmental approvals
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
to to construct any projects on the on
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
the federal system within the state of
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so effectively what that
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
means is we would not be able to accept
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
federal dollars to construct any road
 
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
project within the state of New
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire until we we had a project that
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrated compliance with the Federal
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
regul ation which includes compliance
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
with the Department's noise
 
01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
with the Department's noise
policy

01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
followup so um in this uh I think it was
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
a 1500 number that that you referred to
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
correct and some states have a lesser
 
01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:09.639 align:start position:0%
requirement some states have a higher
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
requirement so does that fall within the
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines in other words do
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
they say, 1500 or 1,200 or a th000 does
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
that make any difference yes so they
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
they just indicate that it needs to be
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
we need to have some way of fair and
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
equitably identifying
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
reasonableness um and and they say that
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to be either based upon a uh
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
cost per square foot or a or a square
 
01:24:39.109 --> 01:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
foot per benefited receptor if you look
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
at our past noise policies we used to
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
have noise policies that had um that had
 
01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
utilize a cost per square foot um and
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
the problem with us utilizing a cost per
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
square foot is cost as everybody knows
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know you have inflation and and and
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know and cost of construction go up
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
you're constantly having to re-evaluate
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
the cost but then at the same time you
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
end up uh increasing the uh the
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
the the cost per square foot number to
 
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
to to adjust so essentially if you do
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
the math it comes back it has always the
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
Department's uh Effectiveness criteria
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
has always been, 1500 square fet per
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
benefited receptor if that makes sense
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I might I have two very
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
short questions very short please so in
 
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
regard to the criteria that uh the other
 
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives spoke about um that uh
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
since the trees have been cleared
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically that the noise levels have
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
gone up significantly so have those uh
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
sound decel levels been verified since
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
the trees have been cleared so that it
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
would potentially impact this
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
significantly so again uh we utilize a
 
01:25:52.109 --> 01:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
noise model to identify noise impacts
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
and we're using uh using it under the
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
instructed conditions now in order to be
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we've identified any potential
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
noise impacts and the and truly
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
identified the benefits of noise
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
barriers we actually typically the the
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
the noise model is um you we can add
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
noise uh what we call sound zones and in
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
this case here like like tree zones or
 
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
say a row of buildings or something like
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
that can actually be added into the
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
noise model but as a rule of thought and
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
for this project we we we did not model
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
with any trees at all so what that
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
effectively means is regardless of
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
removing those trees or not we're
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
getting noise levels that that are as
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
though there were no trees there to
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
begin with and there would no be no
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
trees there to end with great um so so
 
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
essentially it's identifying all
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
potential noise impacts that are that
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be within that Corridor okay and
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
then the final question so I those
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
decibel reports available to the public
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
for them to view based on your 1500
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
criteria to show for instance that these
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods have, 1500 these other
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
ones have 1,400 or whatever show the
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and and where those would be
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
so that uh if if there was some concern
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
that might be a neighborhood right next
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
to another one that uh maybe that
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
barrier should be continued just in that
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
area to also continue with that
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
abatement so the so so as part of the
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
environmental process for the
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
environmental revieww process for the
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
ever Turnpike project uh we completed an
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
environmental study uh of the entire
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
Corridor that that study includes the
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
results of the noise noise analysis that
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
was completed for this project uh so
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
which highlights all of those things
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're asking for thank you very much Mr
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for your tolerance
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
representative fauler for the final
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr CH
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh do you have the flexibility to offer
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
something is it all or nothing barrier
 
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
or nothing or can you offer noise
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
mitigation measures that are short of
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
providing a
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
full noise barrier such as triple
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
glazing windows or Stockade fences or
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
things like that uh so so so the answer
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
is is is effectively no um we if you're
 
01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
if you're providing noise abatement it
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
needs to provide noise benefits um we
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
also do not uh and the Federal Highway
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
Administration requires that that when
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
you mitigate for noise in residential
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
areas it's for exterior areas only so
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
windows and those kinds of things would
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
not be uh something that would be
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
potential noise abatement for a
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
residential area um there's we do get a
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
lot of questions for say the
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
installation of privacy fences I know
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
one of the uh one of the forers the
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
speakers that spoke earlier did mention
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
privacy fences privacy fences uh do not
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
provide noise uh benefits they're not
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
noise mitigation
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're installed in areas
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
where say there are property impacts or
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
something that that are causing you know
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
the property impacts physical property
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
impacts to that property say we're
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
putting in a uh some type of a water
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
quality treatment you know Basin or
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
something like that there they' removed
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
a bunch of trees that were providing
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
privacy or something like that that's
 
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of dealt with on a Case by
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
case basis property by property based
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know upon RightWay discussions you
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
know in the in during that process but
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking uh we do not
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
provide wholesale uh you know
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh privacy privacy fences and there's
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
certainly not intended to be any type of
 
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.270 align:start position:0%
certainly not intended to be any type of
noise

01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
mitigation thank you for the information
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
Mr Evans I'm sure we're going to invite
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
you back when we exec this bill so that
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
you can answer any and all and how many
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
hours worth of questions we might have

relation to mile markers along Route 112
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
my name is Jerry Stringham I am the
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative from the towns of Lincoln
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
Woodstock Easton and Livermore uh
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
Livermore uh is 97% federal land uh it's
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
the largest physical town in my district
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
and has no voters but what it does have
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
is uh Route 112 the Canam Mangus Highway
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
which I think most of you U probably
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
have driven on at some point uh the
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
Canam Mangus highway is 36 Mi long it's
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
a beautiful uh Road it's uh uh the part
 
01:31:05.070 --> 01:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
of the road that we're talking about
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
here as as Lincoln and Woodstock uh in
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
the western part and the southern part
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
of the towns of Conway uh in the eastern
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
part uh the road itself is a National
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
Treasure and a destination many times of
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
year particularly uh during the leaf
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
changing uh uh season
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh when when uh uh new englanders and
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
those from other parts of the country
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
flock uh to see our our our Beauty at
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
its glorious uh it's a very windy road
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
with constant turns and
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
Hills uh it's a destination for uh
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
sightseers um uh hikers uh and campers
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh it in it includes such uh such uh
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
destinations as Lincoln Woods uh with fr
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
conia Falls sabad day Falls uh some of
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
our 4,000 Footers including the Hancock
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
Mountains and the OAS and has more than
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
a dozen uh campgrounds along it um uh so
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
you know while we bring here there are
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
safety issues uh with this road there's
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
basically no cell phone service uh along
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
most of Route 112 in that section so and
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
people do get in trouble the roads are
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
very very hilly there's a hair pin turn
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
the grades are 9% and up uh and um uh
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know should something happen like a
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
breakdown or or an accident or uh when
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
the weather's bad even sling sliding off
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
the road uh there's no direct ability to
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
ask for help so typically what happens
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
when a car or bicyclist or truck gets
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
into trouble uh a Good Samaritan offers
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
to help and uh uh uh of course they
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
can't can't call either so they proceed
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
down the road until their cell service
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh kicks back in and by the time they've
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
getting there they may have driven 5 to
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
10 miles cu the the stretch of road with
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
with little cell service is over 20 mil
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
long along that road uh and uh at that
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
point the details get a little foggier
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes and it's hard to hard to relay
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
what's going on so House Bill 7113 SE to
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
better the odds uh that our neighbors
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
and visitors will get timely help in the
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunate
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh that occur uh very very
 
01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
frequently uh along this highway and it
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
does it does so uh by putting mile
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
markers up there so that when somebody
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
notices trouble they have more of an
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
ability to relay what's going on there's
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
one time you're going to going to notice
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
the mile markers is it's when you're
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
driving away from something and you're
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
trying to uh make a mental note of of of
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
where the help is needed uh three
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
different organizations have asked for
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill uh uh the Lincoln Police uh
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
who are here and will will uh can speak
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
about uh circumstances that they've
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
they've F uh fallen into will be here uh
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Lynnwood Ambulance Service uh which
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
is called on dispatches uh and um uh you
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
know one of the things they mentioned is
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
it can even be harder in busy times
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
because uh not not only do you not know
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
where to go but uh there can be some
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy slow traffic so uh it can
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
make a big difference on uh on uh how
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
how long they can respond and then
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
finally the EM emergency vehicle
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
services are towing companies uh and
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
Arnold's Towing I know was uh was hoping
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
to be here today but uh they responded
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
to three calls last night between 1 p.m.
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
and 5:00 a.m. uh you know up up uh
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
toward Franconia Notch and so on so uh
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
and um but they did want me to mention
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
that they emphasized that people have
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
especially people who who don't drive
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
the can very often have a great deal of
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
difficulty of describing where it is
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
that they noticed a breakdown or
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
somebody in
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
trouble uh um you know separately uh
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh like to mention that some of the
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
service organizations basically uh the
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
Rotary Club in Lincoln uh on the west
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
side and the rotary's Conway office uh
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
con Conway uh uh Rotary Club a both have
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um this is something that
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
they'd like to see and be willing to
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
help if it helps uh reduce the cost it's
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
certainly not something uh this is a
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
major public safety and it should be
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
done right and engine engineered
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
properly it's not something uh that uh a
 
01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
service organization can do the entire
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
amount but uh for example one thing
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the budget is that there's
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
a uh uh
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
$65,000 of traffic control uh presumably
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
when the 36 or so mile M Signs would be
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh put up um who's going to make sure
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
that the cars stop at the appropriate
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
time uh both these organizations clean
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
clean the can uh at least once a year so
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
they block off uh they have big signs at
 
01:36:33.390 --> 01:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
each end of the can you know be be
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
careful and uh you can find pictures of
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
people like myself with with big yellow
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
vests on and uh pick picking up loose
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
trash and um you know making this kind
 
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
of a permanent um Improvement to the
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
public safety for those who come to our
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
towns uh you know would be certainly
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
something that might help reduce the
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
overall cost of this although I think
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know primarily here we're going to
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
be talking about just the advisability
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
of it and and hopefully getting your
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
support So in summary you know the Can
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
is a beautiful iconic Highway that draws
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
visitors and out ofers to our towns and
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
our restaurants and our hotels and uh I
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
hope you'll uh uh support House Bill 713
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and send it over to the finance
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
committee where where I serve so thank
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
you for your time if you have any
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to answer thank
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
you do we have any
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown I just
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
have a quick question this I spend a lot
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
of time up there hiking and taking
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
friends that visit from out of state up
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
there all the time so uh in the winter
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
up there those uh snow banks are pretty
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
high I know you stick up the tree
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
branches up there to enable the plows do
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
that so these are going to have to be
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
specially constructed road marker signs
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
I assume taller than normal
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if this I mean the
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
banks are pretty high along i93 too yeah
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh um you know there's there's you know
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
I think one of the factors is you know
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
how they should be designed how can we
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
make them blend with the natural beauty
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
of the highway and you know not just be
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know big and ugly I guess uh but
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know what is the right height um
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's there was talk about
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
having a contest maybe they should be
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
silhouetted and look like the old man in
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
the mountain or a bear rather than just
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
a uh rectangular green sign with a
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
number on them but uh um but the the
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
issue that you brought up is why uh why
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
this can't be or why it be better done
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
by the professionals at Dot and the
 
01:38:46.589 --> 01:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
involved with the design rather than
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
just the charity thank
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
01:38:53.669 --> 01:38:53.679 align:start position:0%
very much representative
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to recognize Deputy
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
police chief Scott McKinley who's asked
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
for 20 minutes and I don't think we'll
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
need you more than three
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully good morning um the reason why
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
I put 20 is I have no idea I saw you had
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
a question mark there and I was like
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of questions are going to be
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
asked um so welcome to Public Works sir
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
well this is my first uh Adventure down
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
here doing something like this in 34
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
years in law enforcement um I spent a
 
01:39:26.189 --> 01:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
lot of time in Lincoln this is my second
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
stint um back in the
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
90s um believe it or not we had the same
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue that we had no mile markers or
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
anything to help visitors not only the
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
ones in our our own State the New
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
England area in our own country but
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
visitors from throughout the world who
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
come and visit our lovely Community um
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
we have an incident up on on the can
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
they have a hard time telling us where
 
01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
it is so by the time we get our
 
01:40:00.669 --> 01:40:00.679 align:start position:0%
apparatus up there police Fire EMS it
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
may not even be in our jurisdiction so
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
now what we've done is we've moved our
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
emergency services to a desolate part of
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
our community and then we get another
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
call so now we're coming back because we
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
don't have the proper
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
information to put people out there I
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
started this issue um with the state
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
I've actually reached out to
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh William Lambert who was the traffic
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
engineer administrator for New Hampshire
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
dot back in
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
2022 and I was told unfortunately
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
there's no money so I sent another email
 
01:40:36.719 --> 01:40:37.709 align:start position:0%
there's no money so I sent another email
in

01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
2023 same response
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
2024 same response and I reached out
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
with Linda massima and I asked her for
 
01:40:46.599 --> 01:40:47.709 align:start position:0%
with Linda massima and I asked her for
some

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:47.719 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
assistance and she said she was going to
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
work on it she did not get
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
reelected and then just
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
recently uh representative Stringham had
 
01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
advised that he had put forth a bill
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
which I
 
01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
which I
150%

01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
150%
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
support um I believe that we need this
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
in our community and this affects
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
112 all the way from Bath New Hampshire
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
all the way over to Conway there are no
 
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.870 align:start position:0%
all the way over to Conway there are no
mile

01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
mile
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
markers on that roadway whatsoever it's
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
a safety issue
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of why we're here
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
um he talked about the cell service
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
there is none as you know anybody that's
 
01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
spent time up in that area um and we
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
just want to be able to send the
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
services responsibly to where they need
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
to be um
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
without uh
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing responding to other
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
Chief any questions representative
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
fauler thank you Mr uh in your
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
experience as the for service department
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture been aware of this issue
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
or involved in this uh question at all
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I have brought this up to our local
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um representatives for
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
the forest service and
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
they I got some push back saying that it
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
unbuy the roadway um which I totally
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
understand um the can is a beautiful
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
area but it's a very unsafe area at
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
times when we have emergency situations
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
um my chief just indicated to me that I
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
failed to mention that we have issues
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
with radios as well so when we get out
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
on the can uh sometimes we can't even
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
communicate to our own dispatch
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
um we have to relay our conversations
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
through another fire apparatus or
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle that might be coming
 
01:43:07.229 --> 01:43:07.239 align:start position:0%
to where we are and then they forward it
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
to our dispatch we dispatch at Lincoln
 
01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
Police Department Lynwood
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh the fire
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
department we also call out for services
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
for towing Etc um and we also assist
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
with uh communic ation with the US
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%

01:43:27.679 --> 01:43:30.870 align:start position:0%
Forest Service as well um we work very
well

together thank you
 
01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.470 align:start position:0%
together thank you
representative

01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure but was it true at one
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
time the the kangamangus during the
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
winter was not uh cleaned up or anything
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
it was left kind of like closed
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
due to the Natural
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know when that was I believe
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was in maybe the
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
40s it was they closed it because they
 
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
were having issues with cleaning um the
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
only Road that's closed in that area
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
would be uh be Notch Road um so in
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
reference to that that do does a
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful job the snow banks are
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
extremely high as he's saying they're
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
probably sometimes seven or8 feet tall
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
um but I think if we work together as a
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
team we can make sure that those mile
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
markers stay unobstructed so people will
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
have a reference point that they can
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
emergency thank representative
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
Newman I I hope this is a a brief
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
question if there's no cell service and
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
no mile markers currently how do people
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
that have had a
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
situation get any get through to
 
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
you sometimes they describe they'll say
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know by that big rock or by the
 
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
hiking area on the on the sharp sharp
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
corner we know that's The Hairpin um a
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
lot of times it's a guessing game um
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
we'll head out there we'll send a police
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
unit and we'll go up to that uh location
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
trying to confirm that there's an issue
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
um I've gone all the way over
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
to um past sabad Day falls where we stop
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
um patrolling we we cover Livermore all
 
01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
the way to sabay and I've not found a
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
crash that they reported because it it
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
actually happened five miles further
 
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
towards the Conway side so this is a
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
delay in in getting Emergency Services
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
where they need to be which we all know
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
that every
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
second that we Del lay an ambulance
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
could cost somebody their life and that
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
is the biggest reason why I'm very
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
passionate about this and I will push
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
and push and push until I retire to get
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
mile markers out on that
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
roadway thank you very much yes one
 
01:46:14.109 --> 01:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
followup please yes but how do they get
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
in touch with you to tell you it's by a
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
big rock they don't get Self Service
 
01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:20.679 align:start position:0%
until Lon
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
mountain or there's this one little tiny
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
spot up by CL Graham that sometimes if
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
you stand in the right location and hold
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
your phone up that you might be able to
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
get a message out to somebody so you
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
know we're hoping with technology we
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
have some you know we have a lot lot of
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
things moving forward technology wise
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
that make this easier possibly with GPS
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
but we need to do the responsible thing
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
as a state and and explore this and and
 
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
get some mile markers out there so we
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
can get Services where they need to be
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
understood thank you very
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
much uh one question Mr Melvin
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Melvin could you could
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
you tell me how many uh service calls
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
you get out there
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
year well I had my dispatch supervisor
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
pull up um our statistics and I will
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
that because we go out there for all
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
sorts of different things we Patrol it
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.589 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
average on average at 300 plus calls per
 
01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:38.750 align:start position:0%
average on average at 300 plus calls per
year

01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
um and and those are you know responses
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
to a crash uh somebody calling in a
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
reckless driver um somebody parked in
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
the wrong space I mean it's it's medical
 
01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.189 align:start position:0%
the wrong space I mean it's it's medical
call

01:47:54.189 --> 01:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
it just it would I could break it down
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
if I need to come back and speak some
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
more and talk hours I can do that
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
too thank you very
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
much at this time I would like to call
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
barones thank you sir welcome to Public
 
01:48:21.199 --> 01:48:22.910 align:start position:0%
barones thank you sir welcome to Public
Works

01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
Works
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you it seems like this was just
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
last Tuesday I'll for you uh so thank
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
you members of committee uh I appreciate
 
01:48:32.430 --> 01:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity my name is Lee bonis I'm
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the Bureau of
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
traffic at Dot and State traffic
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
engineer uh among other things Bureau of
 
01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
traffic is responsible for signs and
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here to speak to you
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
today um the department does not take
 
01:48:47.709 --> 01:48:47.719 align:start position:0%
any position on this bill but I'm here
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
to provide some basic information and to
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
answer questions from the perspective of
 
01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.470 align:start position:0%
answer questions from the perspective of
do

01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I will try to be brief recognizing
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time um just for so we're all in the
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
same language mile markers sometimes
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
called mile posts um our prevailing
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
Authority on this matter is the manual
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
of uniform traffic control devices
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
published by USD and is applicable to
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
all public roadways that manual um calls
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
them reference location signs uh or
 
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
enhanced reference location signs but
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
I'll call them m markers for for
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
convenience um these signs uh I think we
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
all are familiar with them they display
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
the miles from the origin originating
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
point of the route the enhanced signs
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
also include a root shield and the
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
cardinal direction north south east west
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh for the purpose of this it would say
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
112 with the shield with North uh east
 
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
or west on it and it would have the
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
mileage from the origin in bath um the
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
purpose is to assist a motorist knowing
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
how far they've traveled and the
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
distance to the exitor destination
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
that's the primary purpose according to
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway Administration it's also
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
useful as reference for engineering and
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance so we know where we're going
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
to dig out a culvert or what have you
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
but most importantly is for Public
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
Safety identifies location of an
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
incident for cers reporting an incident
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
and for responders to find that
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
incident uh so the existing landscape uh
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a mix of mile markers
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
on roads uh interstates and major
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
divided highways uh we've been
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
transitioning to the enhanced reference
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
location sign this is the required sign
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
that you see um on um say in estate 93
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
393 right here in the concerete area um
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
we just had a recent project to update
 
01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
those signs um on all but um a few of
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
the interstates some are Turnpike um and
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
Spalding um haven't haven't had an
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
upgrade as yet but they're being done as
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
projects allow U but we handled 9 3 393
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
293 um and 101 with all new signs um so
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
that's the current
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
standard um there are other roads uh on
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
the national highway system uh both
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
divided and undivided that have a mix of
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
older style signs uh ones that aren't
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily compliant with the current
 
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
rules um you'll see some smaller units
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
say Mile and sometimes you'll see even
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
small smaller ones that have uh
 
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.629 align:start position:0%
small smaller ones that have uh
intermediate

01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
intermediate
 
01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
markings um they're they're everywhere
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
but they're not everywhere um and um
 
01:51:37.390 --> 01:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're out there but they are
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
not no longer compliant
 
01:51:44.589 --> 01:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
um mile markers are required uh to be EV
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
at every mile according to the manual
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
uniform traffic control devices um but
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
they do allow intermediate signs here in
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and uh nearby States
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
we use two10 of a mile as our intervals
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's what you'll see on the
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
interstate um the advantage of them at
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
closer intervals is if you have to walk
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
to find the nearest sign you're not
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
walking a full mile you're walking at
 
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
most two two t0 of a mile uh on the
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
interstates with open um sight lines you
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
can sometimes see from one to another uh
 
01:52:18.430 --> 01:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
even at night and on the interstates
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
we've got them back to back on both
 
01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
sides of the highway when it's divided
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see the nearest one may be
 
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:28.470 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see the nearest one may be
behind

01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
you uh let's see our Focus has been on
 
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
the higher volume roadways uh where
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
where the value of them does the most
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
good for the most people uh but they
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
also provide values on all roadways and
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
as we've heard from testimony here
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
particularly on roads with few other
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
landmarks and identifiers um so I am uh
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
I am personally an advocate for mile
 
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
markers um I think that they uh they do
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of value um let's see uh
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
the legislation uh the proposed
 
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:05.950 align:start position:0%
the legislation uh the proposed
legislation

01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
specifies uh mile markers at one mile
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
intervals along the full length of New
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 112 also known as can mangas
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
highway from Lincoln to
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
Conway um and the intended benefit is
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
principally for Public Safety um some
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
key notes um New Hampshire 112 runs from
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
Bath to Conway um the legislation kind
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
of mixes things says full length of 112
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
but also says linol to Conway for the
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions uh for the fiscal note uh I
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
referred to lincol to Conway um and to
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
be a little more specific I assume the
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
start in Lincoln would be at the uh
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest boundary
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh going east to uh Route 16 in
 
01:53:52.069 --> 01:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
Conway um it did specify one mile
 
01:53:52.079 --> 01:53:53.069 align:start position:0%
Conway um it did specify one mile
interval

01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
interval
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh we recommend 2/10 of a mile but the
 
01:53:58.669 --> 01:53:58.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is uh based on one uh one
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
mile um but I also included I'm not sure
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
if it got into what you saw um an
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
estimate for at
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
210 um we also assume the signs will
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
comply with the uh mutcd uh which will
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
be the same size as on the divided
 
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
highways uh we're assuming only on one
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
side of the road um because it is a
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
two-way Road um and that they would have
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
backtack signs so that each each
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
Direction can see the signs One
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
Direction you'll be on the right the
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
other direction will be on the
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
left so that was the those were the
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
assumptions um so basically advantages
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
like like I said I'm an advocate for
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
mile markers u i I could I wish I could
 
01:54:42.750 --> 01:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
spend my retirement putting mile markers
 
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
up around the state uh there's plenty of
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
work to do um the addition of mile
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
markers would um well we've we've heard
 
01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
that testimony there's there's a lot of
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
advantages to it in addition to um you
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
know for engineering and maintenance um
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
so the other folks uh non-emergency
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
folks have references uh we do recommend
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
the two uh 02 mile interval uh some of
 
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
the drawbacks and unfortunately I always
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
have to talk about things like that um
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
the project uh there's only so much
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
money and this project would displace uh
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
money from other projects that are
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
already programmed uh through the the
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
established prioritization project um
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
another drawback is impact on Scenic
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
Vistas unfortunately we can't uh change
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
the face of the signs they are required
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
to be that way just like a stop sign has
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
to be red eight-sided U and so forth um
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
our reference location signs have to
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
meet these
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
criteria um and the other I I guess the
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
the biggest drawback is uh is kind of a
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
a fairness thing is there's an expect
 
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation of similar signs
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
on other roads
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
um uh you know this is proposed for the
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
Canam Mangus uh we've got lots of other
 
01:56:01.149 --> 01:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
roads that could also use them us3
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
Lancaster to Pittsburgh uh route n Kean
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
to hopkington uh 26 C Brook to Errol uh
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
25c Pont to Warren uh 16 Bartlett to
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
gorm it goes you know goes on and on uh
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
also New Hampshire 112 from Lincoln East
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
to Bath
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
um we like every thing there's a lot of
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
things we want to do and there's only so
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
much we can do with the money that we
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
have so we have a prioritization uh
 
01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
process through the gaset um and so
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's really my my concern
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
is legislating the priorities when
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
there's already an established priority
 
01:56:44.589 --> 01:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
um however I do feel that that strongly
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
that they provide value this is
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
certainly an eligible Road and would be
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
worthy um and then then I'll have to
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
deal with the the next town that comes
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
and says what about our road so any
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative Jack uh thank
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for appearing
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh what's the funding source for this
 
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
road and the second question would be
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
does the mutcd have any May or shall or
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
or language that would would guide us as
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
to whether these should be installed
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh funding is um normally we would
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
take Federal funding when we can take it
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
um this would be eligible for federal
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
funding one way or another um we do have
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
a constrained program and so if you take
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds for this it's less federal
 
01:57:36.910 --> 01:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
funds for a bridge or a you know
 
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
sidewalk or something else um we could
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
also use State funds if we we've had
 
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
earmark funds for projects before um we
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
certainly don't turn down any source of
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
funds um as long as it's legitimate um
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
but for the for the Assumption we were
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
assuming it was federal funds uh as far
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
as um Maze and shells and the regulation
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh you are not required to have mile
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
markers uh however if you do they are
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
required to be either of the form that's
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
called a reference location sign or the
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
enhanced reference location sign um and
 
01:58:19.629 --> 01:58:19.639 align:start position:0%
those are the the green and white um the
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
the simpler ones just say mile and then
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
have an uh mile number in vertical uh on
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
the side of the road um we you we have
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
used the enhanced on the interstates
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
because it helps folks know what road
 
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
they're on it also helps reinforce which
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
direction you're going in because you
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
see North or east you know every two10
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
of a mile uh so our preference our
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to use the enhanced
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
SS any further
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative bogert
 
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
could you uh provide a best guess
 
01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
estimate of what the cost of this would
 
01:59:01.709 --> 01:59:01.719 align:start position:0%
be it's it's in the it's in the fiscal
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
note yeah and just so you don't have to
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
look it up we had roughly 288,000 would
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
be at the one mile interval and about
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
580,000 uh for them at 210 of a
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
mile thank you any further
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
much for your test Tony sir and at this
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
point in time I'd like to close the
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
713 which brings us to opening up the
 
01:59:37.149 --> 01:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
745 naming a bridge in the city of Keane
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
after Charles
 
01:59:46.430 --> 01:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
Redfern and I would like to recognize
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
welcome to Public Works
 
01:59:57.790 --> 01:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chair this is my first
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%

representative chesher district 3 I'm
 
02:00:15.149 --> 02:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
also in my 28th year as a city councelor
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
in Kean and I'm also on the board of
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to talk to you
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh about RSA 3 colon 43 uh name which
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
deals with naming a state facility uh
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm requesting an alternative use Trail
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
bridge in Keen New Hampshire be named
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
The Charles Redford Bridge um it's a
 
02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
340t span it was uh proposed in 2015
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
finished in 2018 it was done completely
 
02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire and for
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
that I thank you
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
us this uh since it's completion this
 
02:01:04.109 --> 02:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
bridge has seen thousands of Walkers
 
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
bikers snowmobilers horseback Riders and
 
02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
so on uh in Kean we have a great
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
system of of bridges and alternative use
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
paths and we're very proud of that there
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm telling you this is
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
because we're going to tell you a little
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
Redfern our system is very well planned
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
use trail system when it comes to
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
discussion about planning the developing
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the Keen trail system Charles Redfern
 
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
is the Mr Everything 30 years ago
 
02:01:44.069 --> 02:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
Charles Redfern had a vision for a trail
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
system using mostly former rail beds at
 
02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
that time the city father said show me
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.870 --> 02:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
he was a founding charter member of a
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization which he called
 
02:02:00.669 --> 02:02:00.679 align:start position:0%
Pathways for Keen the organization's
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
sole purpose was to raise money to pay
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
for the development and maintenance of
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
the entire city alternative use Trail
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
Network thanks to Pathways for Keen
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
mostly through the dedicated tedious
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
work of Charles Redford millions of
 
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
dollars were raised via private donation
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
to fund this well-planned extension
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
extensive trail system without the
 
02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
vision the tenacity and a dedicated
 
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
efforts of Charles Redford there would
 
02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
Kean this bridge is on the south side of
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
keen so we we never gave it a name it
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
was the only bridge on the South Side so
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
we called it the South Bridge and we
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
just referred to that uh coming up
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
within the next few four years there's
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
going to be three more bridges coming up
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
on the south side of Keane so it loses
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
that Geographic
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
significance uh that that we have uh one
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
of us we're reusing if any of you from
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
the London dery area the prous bridge we
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
bought that for a dollar if we didn't
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
pay that yet uh my wife gave me a dollar
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
today I'll give it to you and we would
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh so there goes that South that
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
designation is Southbridge so it's a
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
bridge with no name right now uh Charles
 
02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
Redfern has done everything he could for
 
02:03:22.750 --> 02:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
our trails with in New
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh right now he is in uh
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
Florida preparing to sell his property
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
down air because he's trying to prepare
 
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
for some uh health issues coming up
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
which I really don't want to get into uh
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to see this bridge named
 
02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
after Charles I know uh some past
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
practices is that the person had had to
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
be not living anymore uh I would like to
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
see I know that's not in the RSA and
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
would like to see uh this happen I think
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
it would be great if he could take he
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
has a um a grandson who's handicapped
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
who uh he Charles and his wife have have
 
02:04:08.549 --> 02:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
refurbished a van so it's can use
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
handicap facilities
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
and they take this grandson everywhere I
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
think it would be great if Charles could
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
take his grandson push his him in his
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
wheelchair over that bridge and say yes
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
they named this after me and not have to
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
one day push his grandson over that
 
02:04:30.030 --> 02:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
bridge and say your grandfather's gone
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
but uh we would like to but that was
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
Bridge was named after
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
him Charles Redfern does not even know
 
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm here today he doesn't know how
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
to know about this bill right now um I
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
know this is a public process but we
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
were just trying to keep it a surprise
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
as much as we
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
could and that being said I know of you
 
02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:52.990 align:start position:0%
could and that being said I know of you
receive

02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
receive
 
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
Communications from the Keen city
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
manager the Keane city
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
mayor a number of uh Keane City
 
02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:01.400 align:start position:0%

in the community is in full support of
 
02:05:14.589 --> 02:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
this um I would have liked to uh have a
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
letter from the full city council but
 
02:05:19.549 --> 02:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
that would have been public publicly not
 
02:05:22.030 --> 02:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
notified and then Mr red would have
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
found out about this uh and would have
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
ruined the surprise I would rather wait
 
02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
till after you executive this bill
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%

a little bit more about Red's history I
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%

experience thank you for that question
 
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's a very good one and uh actually he
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
worked for the uh New Hampshire
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue as an auditor and
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
he brought in millions of dollars to the
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%

uh and he's not a political guy he's
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
kind of apolitical but he did that
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
because he wanted to see some of these
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
trails get passed through uh the the
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%

auditor uh that was his career he is
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
retired from that now um at the same
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
time he picked up the Reigns in in Keen
 
02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:19.880 align:start position:0%

he and it's rare is a city meeting that
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
he's not there um the uh the background
 
02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:34.719 align:start position:0%
of all of us you'll recall we're all
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
used to having rail Trails today uh that
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
are converted and now there's different
 
02:07:40.910 --> 02:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
fundraising that how they get maintained
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
and how they're brought along um that
 
02:07:47.229 --> 02:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
but we all know the benefit of having
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
abandoned Railways converted into
 
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
recreational use um when uh Charles
 
02:07:56.109 --> 02:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
Redfern started this work there was no
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
such thing it was only less than 20
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
years prior to when he started this work
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
that the rails were still active in Keen
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
so the rails went out of business in
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
Keen sometime in the 70s and all of
 
02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
these uh Rail lines lay fallow and
 
02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%
eventually would have been carved up
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
into different uh divisions into
 
02:08:18.430 --> 02:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
different um uh commercial occupancies
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
residential occupancies whatever but all

02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
making in short if if you name any
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
segment of the of the rail trail system
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
in Kean Chuck Redfern had a hand in
 
02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
bringing it to
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
fruition Keen Keane is very lucky that
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
Chuck Redfern chose to devote his life
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
to bike trail advocacy because without
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
without him Keen would not have been
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
able to build such a comprehensive and
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
beautiful bike path system so I'm
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
definitely in favor of naming the bridge
 
02:13:51.679 --> 02:13:53.549 align:start position:0%

02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
second representative fauler seconds
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
open this for discussion I'll start out
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
by saying it was recognized normally
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
just as a as a matter of of uh president
 
02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
on this committee we wait until somebody
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
is deceived
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
before we try to name after anything
 
02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
after him or we'd be deluged with these
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
kind of bills uh however there has been
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
president before uh at least twice that
 
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
I know in this committee uh
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative was wzor was one of them
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I forget the
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
gentleman's name up north Ray Burton Ray
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
Burton we named something after him for
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons as as this
 
02:26:20.110 --> 02:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee is pushing this bill forward
 
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
um that and the fact that normally we
 
02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
always insist on having a letter from
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
the town and it sounded like they had to
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
be a little secretive about this
 
02:26:31.630 --> 02:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
however representative Edgar found the
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
letter from the mayor so that's that's
 
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
good enough for for me as far as I'm
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
concerned having that I'll repres
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%

02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair uh I don't know if he'll be
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
back from Florida at the time but if we
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
do uh if we do put it do it from the
 
02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
floor I know there's people from Keen
 
02:29:29.469 --> 02:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
that would want to be be there in
 
02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
attendance but if you if it's easier for
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
you to put it on the consent agenda
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
that's fine with
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
normally Yeah well yeah but we usually
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
have uh we usually have enough for the
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
House vote but you that's correct we can
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
always have them there for the Senate
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%

02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
be fine consent would be fine yes do we
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
