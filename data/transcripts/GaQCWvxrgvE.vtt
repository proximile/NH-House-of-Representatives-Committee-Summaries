minutes for our chairman however my
 
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is he is okay but it
 
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like the front of another car hit
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
the rear end of his car so we are going
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
to have to start without him but um it
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%

the care of Physicians and therapists um
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
as far as them being a transgender
 
00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
individual and they were following uh
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
the standards of care published by the
 
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.749 align:start position:0%

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
professional um Association of
 
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
professionals those those three
 
00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
individuals that I
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
knew did not experience surgical
 
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
procedures until after the age of
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
18 and they are perfectly normal
 
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
society it concerns me that this legis
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposing legislation that
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
would discriminate
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
against young
 
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
male Youth and their
 
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
families it doesn't talk about anyone
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
else outside of being male it doesn't
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
talk about inter sex people who may be
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
genitalia it's focused on one group
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's already protected by New
 
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.670 align:start position:0%
that's already protected by New
Hampshire

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
statute I'm especially
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that although this bill has no
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
financial information for the most part
 
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
unknown is that in past ing this
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
legislation you will subject the state
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to substantial legal
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
costs uh we are already seeing um in the
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
US especially
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
as people cross state lines to get care
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
children currently Texas is suing the
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
state or
 
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
the um Seattle children center
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
for care that's provided to a child
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
whose family moved out of Texas and that
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
courts much of the care that's given to
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
our residents comes from
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I know this to be true
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
because I got my
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures two years ago at at
 
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
Mass General I I also know that many of
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
the children who are getting
 
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.350 align:start position:0%
the children who are getting
Professional

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
Professional
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
Care get that
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
care from outside the
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
state as well as experts within our
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
state um even though much of that is
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic care but it's also working
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
with them to help them become
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
society at this point
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
um I don't have anything more to say on
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
this bill but I feel it's egregious to
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
the um the transgender population as a
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
whole and I'm concerned about um our
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
transgender Youth and what this means to
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you madam chair um
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
Elliot Hospital said on their website
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
they with question they said that those
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
Services aren't provided but on their
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
website they say they provide top and
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
bottom surgery so we really and then you
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
said that um children are or people are
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
not getting this kind of care in New
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but then you said yet that
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
they are getting it from Professionals
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
in our state so we don't know what is
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
the what is actually happening they are
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
getting therapeutic
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
care you what is you what do you mean by
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
therapeutic care hormones or no what do
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
you can you iterate on therapeutic care
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
um oneon-one
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
psychological care working working with
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
folks to help cope with a a problem um
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
there may be Top surgery
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
however currently young women can get
 
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.670 align:start position:0%
however currently young women can get
Breast

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
Breast
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
Care that's not associated with being a
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
transgender in
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
individual and the same thing would be
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
true for top top surgical procedures as
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
far as breast augmentation uh for a
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
young man it just from an aesthetic
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
perspective um and and that has been
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
country are are you representative are
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
you talking about over
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
here are you talking about um like
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
pectoral implants for men is that what
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
you were talking about yes okay further
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
surgery short of surgery would would
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
these prohibitions uh affect any any of
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the care you talked about uh therapeutic
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
hormonal and that kind of thing that is
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
short of surgery would would those kind
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
of because it mentions chemicals
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
would whatever effect chemicals have on
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
the human body um when it's involved
 
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
with the treatment would any of that
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
treatment be also um prohibited by this
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
bill I'm concerned that it might uh
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
currently hormone blockers just stall
 
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
currently hormone blockers just stall
the

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
development they don't change anything
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
associated with the male gen
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
genitalia um it's a pause in the cycle
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and if the hormone blockers are stopped
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
the the cycle
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
continues so it it's not a it does not
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
change um physically
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
um what happens with you it just stalls
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
it at one point when they start their
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
homeown blockers thank
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
you represent Reed it is my
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that depending on what
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
stage of the Tanner scale of development
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the puberty blockers are started it
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
completely can you explain or that
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
further it thank it stalls it it stops
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
IT and and it will start as soon as the
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers are
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%

let's what oh they are now they were oh
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
I think that meant chemical castration
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
but yeah um representative

619 um I'm curious about your opinion um
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of how the bills compare um and
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
is are they would you consider them to
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
be uh equally problematic is one more
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
problematic than the other and and and
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
why I I would feel that they're equally
 
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.389 align:start position:0%
why I I would feel that they're equally

thank you um doctor you're a doctor

correct I am a doctor are you licensed
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
to practice in New Hampshire yes I am
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
where did you get that
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
license what is that who issues the
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
license I have a New Hampshire State no
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
but who issues that license the New
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Medical Board so
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
politicians do have a role in medicine
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
is that not
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
correct they my understanding is that
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
they initiate some of the licensing
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
requirements but the medic few things
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't they I mean are we not LIC
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
how many medical how many politicians
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
are on Medical Board no how many well we
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
wrote the law that created the medical
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
board and do we not decide what drugs
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
can be written
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
prescribed is that in this committee
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah well this is the
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee we we look at
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
drugs yeah so my point is is for your
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
comment to say that government has no
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
role in medicine that's not correct is
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
it I didn't say it had no role I said
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill is government overreach
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
actually at the beginning you did say
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
that but that's okay questions for the
 
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.990 align:start position:0%
that but that's okay questions for the

for a different reason my 16-year-old

has been struggling with many physical
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
and mental health issues over the past
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
three years this past year they

transitioned to homeschooling due to
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
their severe migraines unfortunately we
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
didn't realize at the time just how
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
severe our teens Depression was or that
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
they were also experiencing gender
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
dysphoria in March for the first time in
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
my presence they expressed they were
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing near constant Suicidal
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
Thoughts while at a physician visit
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
immediately we sought counseling for
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
them after beginning therapy they were
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
slowly able to talk more openly to us
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
about things in September they came to
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
me and asked if they were too old start
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy after that conversation
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
a huge weight lifted from our adolescent
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
mind we are now actively receiving care
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
from an endocrinologist olist and just
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
beginning hormone replacement therapy
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
also known as HRT to allow them to have
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
a more feminine body they feel at home
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
in my queer child has started their own
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
journey and I am here to support them
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
however I can witnessing the
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
self-isolation and severe depression
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
they have endured has been horrific and
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
painful as their mother a heartache I
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
hope few parents have to cope with we
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
are incredibly fortunate to continue to
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
have our adolescent here with us today
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
after their attempted suicide in October
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
I sat in a doctor's office well at their
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
side as they revealed details of that
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
attempt their attempt was before they
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
came to me about HRT before they were
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
able to express how loss they were
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
feeling in their own body now there is
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
finally light creeping through the
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
darkness they have been living in as
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
their mom I am able to feel hope again
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
for their future I am grateful every day
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
that their beautiful face is still here
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
for me to touch I know for certain they
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
would not be if it wasn't for the
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
compassionate essential gender affirming
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
care their father and I consented to
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
that they are now receiving I come
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
before you today to share this very
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
personal story to express my deep
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
concern for what this bill is attempting
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
to do I have learned a great deal during
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
the course of the past year through this
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
experience with my teen always being a
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of LGB lgbtqia plus
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
rights I could not comprehend the
 
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
intense emotional turmoil a person
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
experiences when coping with gender
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
dysphoria until my own personal life
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
exposure as a mother and medical
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
professional I know how to advocate for
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
my family I ask questions I listen and I
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
trust I trust in both the practitioners
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
providing care for my family and I trust
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
in my children's words if my adolescent
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
is unable to live in a body that is not
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
the one they were biologically given at
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
16 years old I cannot comprehend how
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
that suddenly becomes a legal right at
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
18 most importantly I cannot fathom how
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
is it expected that their mental health
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
would support them to live through such
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
struggle to reach 18 our trans community
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire will not survive the
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
loss of medical care that this law would
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
bring many transgender people die by
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
Suicide due to gender dysphoria they
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
experience and the extreme mental
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
anguish that our society's lack of
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
acceptance imposes every day it does not
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
have to be this way gender affirming
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
care is not only life-saving but is
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
life-giving hearing my teens say that
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
they are finally able to look at
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
themselves in the mirror and smile again
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
is just one example of the positive
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
impacts that has brought to their life
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
HB 1011 seeks to criminalize loving
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
supportive parents and families along
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
with compassionate providers it
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
tremendously increases the risk to
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
Providers within the granite state
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
providing gender affirming care to their
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
patients in need it would exacerbate the
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
isolation of trans gender adolescent
 
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
will be expected to persevere through
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
while awaiting the age of 18 to receive
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
the care they may desperately need to
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
survive and maybe the breaking point
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
they can no longer battle against please
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%

um speaking as a parent um do you feel
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%

good morning and thank you for taking my
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
testimony I have been to a lot of
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
hearings over the years to a lot of
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions and I'm sure it
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
happens but this is the first time that
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard a bill presented before
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
you start taking testimony I'm sorry
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that didn't happen today because I
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
had questions about the bill that I was
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
hoping would be answered by the people
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
that sponsor it um I excuse me I'm on a
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
um while I believed what um
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative Canon had to say about uh
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
temporary uh hormone blockers I did some
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
research as as I do I am not a scientist
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired teacher and a New
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen but I did see where
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
some um studies show that hormone
 
00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:00.430 align:start position:0%
some um studies show that hormone
blockers

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
blockers
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
might affect down the line um if
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
somebody decides to go back to being a
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
male I don't know if the jury is out on
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
that but I worry that that could be used
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
to keep kids from getting the chemicals
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
they need at 14 15 16 and I was hoping
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
that that would be talked about um today
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so I would suggest that the
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
committee get some of those answers
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
before you vote one of the things that
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
really bothered me was the idea that a
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
parent could be held liable for taking
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
their child across state lines to have
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
care done I don't know if you're aware
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
but there are kids all over this country
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
who are leaving the states they live in
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
and moving to other states specifically
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
because they can't get the care they
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
need and I believe it was in Texas where
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
a young man and his mother moved to New
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
Zealand he was 18 he had had some care
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
that was chemical care I don't know if
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
he'd had any surgery but he was about to
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
start college and they decided that if
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
they move to another state that state
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
might also stop him from getting the
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
hormones he needed and they needed to
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
leave this country less than 2% of our
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
population identifies as transgender and
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
there are so so many bills across this
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
country that that talk about
 
00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:50.269 align:start position:0%
country that that talk about
transgender

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
Youth and I'm sorry but some of the
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
testimony I hear some of the outrage I
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
hear from people like the man who has
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
the sandwich sign that says there are
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
only two genders I worry about our kids
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
I worry about the adults who are
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
transgender I worry about them worrying
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
about their own
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
safety I was lucky enough to work with
 
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:22.990 align:start position:0%
safety I was lucky enough to work with
reny

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
reny
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
Cushing for a couple of years to help
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
pass the trans gender non-discrimination
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
bill and I would hope that we understood
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
all the repercussions of that bill these
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
are human beings you may not have a
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
transgender person in your life I have
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
several and I would suggest that before
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
we pass any of these bills you listen to
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
people like the woman who spoke earlier
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
and you sit down with families because I
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
feel as though we are demonizing a
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
population and this is just one more
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
Bill to do this and I would I should
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
have brought water I'm so sorry but I
 
00:29:11.389 --> 00:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
would like to say to the representative
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that um commented on the fact that um
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hiscock and some of these um
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
places that treat uh transgender youth
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
do do top and bottom surgery and she was
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
confused about whether they did it here
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
and it may have
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
come from a um last legislative session
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
there was a rep that got up and gave a
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
speech and read everything from the
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock site on transgender
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
care and used it to say that we were
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
doing surgery on kids what she didn't
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
read was the bottom line of that page
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
that said please note no surgery is done
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
to anyone under 18 years of age so you
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
really need to do your research before
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
you vote on these bills thank
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
you any
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you for your
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
Hawkins

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and committee I
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
today my name is Sam Hawkins I'm the
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
public policy assistant at Nami New
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the National Alliance on
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
Mental Illness Nami New Hampshire is a
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Grassroots organization whose
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
mission is to improve the lives of all
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
people impacted by mental illness and
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
suicide on behalf of Nami New Hampshire
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to oppose HB 1011 it is
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
our interpretation that the bill intends
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
to uh criminalize uh puberty blockers
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
and hor hormone treatments as well so
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
that is a perspective in our testimony
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh but Nami New Hampshire believes that
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
all people should be treated with
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
respect and dignity and should have
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
access to mental and physical health
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
care free from interference largely due
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
to how they are mistreated and
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
stigmatized in society lgbtq plus
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
individuals especially those who are
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary are often at
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
an elevated risk for experiencing
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
anxiety and depression and are more
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
likely to consider an attempt suicide
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
than their heterosexual or cisgender
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
peers among several other tools and
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
interventions gender affirming
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare is one important way we can
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
improve mental health outcomes for
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary youth
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
research shows that gender affirming
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
treatment including puberty blockers and
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
hormone treatment has a significant
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
association with lowered odds of
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
depression and
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
suicidality our Pol policies should
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
prioritize improving mental health
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
outcomes rather than restricting access
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
to care HB 1011 through CRI
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
criminalizing gender affirming
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
treatments including puberty blockers
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
and hormone treatments for an entire
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
segment of the youth population in our
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
state would eliminate access to vital
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
Services though directly better the
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
lives of transgender and non-binary
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
youth for these re reasons we urge the
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee to itl HB
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
1011 thank you um representative Manion
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I might be
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
interpreting this bill different I've
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of testimony today
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
about these Pub blockers and hormone
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
therapy but not about the actual
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
surgeries so maybe I'm missing something
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
here but when I read this it says
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
physically or chemically removes or
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
Alters genitalia
 
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think in my opinion that isn't
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
the same as hormone blockers or hormone
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
therapy or puberty blockers Am I Wrong
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
can you explain the difference there we
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted the intent of the language
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
chemically Alters to wrap in puberty
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
blockers and hormone
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
treatments thank you for your question
 
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.789 align:start position:0%
treatments thank you for your question
thank

00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned um
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
the the risk of um uh suicidality and I
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to you know we talk about
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
chemicals and and the way that that can
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
has a potential to be irreversible um so
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
my question is is is suicide reversible
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question suicide is
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely not reversible representative
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
please refrain from asking frivolous
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
questions any further
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:25.389 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony

00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
1933 Nazi Germany raided The Institute
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
for sexual research in Berlin this was
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
just 4 months after Hitler was made
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
chancellor of Germany one of the first
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
things he did as
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
Chancellor The Institute for sexual
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
research in
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
Berlin existed as early as
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
199 and was created in
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
response to suicide and loss of life in
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
Community it was created by a medical
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
Community it was created by a medical
doctor

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
who was speaking to a patient who killed
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
himself after he could not
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
access medical care and his rights as a
 
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
access medical care and his rights as a
human

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
being the institute for sexual research
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
in Berlin was
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
founded for as a function of Suicide
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
Prevention and it was one of the first
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
things that Nazi Germany went
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
after I went to public school in this
 
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.069 align:start position:0%
after I went to public school in this
state

00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
and as I'm sure you're aware we've all
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
seen pictures of Nazis burning books
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
from World War II the vast majority of
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
those photographs are destruction of
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
medical textbooks notes and research
 
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
institution I would also like to quote
 
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.310 align:start position:0%
institution I would also like to quote
the

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill this bill says quote it shall not
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
be a defense to prosecution that the
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
minor on whom it is performed or the
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
Minor's parent legal guardian consented
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
procedure I'm having a very difficult
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
time understanding how a bill that says
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
the consent of the individual concerned
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
does not matter could possibly be about
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
the protection of children specifically
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
when this bill also excludes
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
circumcision as a quote accepted
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.470 align:start position:0%
circumcision as a quote accepted
practice

00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision is typically performed at
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
consent and as you can
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
see gender affirming care has also can
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
practice and that's only from the one
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
example in Germany that's over a 100
 
00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.710 align:start position:0%
example in Germany that's over a 100
years

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.270 align:start position:0%
 
old

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
this bill will harm
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
prevention regardless of your personal
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
opinion on the matter this is a greous
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
government overreach and sets a
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent that New Hampshire
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
citizens cannot leave the
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
state and do what they believe is
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
correct for their individual selves and
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
families without not being able to
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
return home for fear of being criminally
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
charged that is a an incredibly
 
00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:08.470 align:start position:0%
charged that is a an incredibly
dangerous

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
precedent and it is not what our state
 
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.390 align:start position:0%
precedent and it is not what our state
stands

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
for little um interactive question here
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
does anybody
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
know what the um latest data says about
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
the percentage of people who regret knee
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
Replacements this is a personal question
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
for me because my mom is currently
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
recovering from a knee replacement any
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
ideas on what percentage of patients who
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
get a knee replacement regret the
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
procedure ma'am the we don't take
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll take it as rhetorical
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
so go ahead sure thank you sir um most
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
data as published by the ni says it's
 
00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:52.910 align:start position:0%
data as published by the ni says it's
about

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
14% And I'll share a personal anecdote
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
obviously this is not data but um my
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
family and I have received lots of um
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
encouragement for my mom receiving her
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
procedure saying that it's great and it
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
will change your life and it the only
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
thing people tend to wish is that they
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
did it
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
earlier and that is for a procedure that
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
has a 14% rate of
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
regret gender affirming care
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
conservatively has a 1% rate of
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
regret most most data suggests it is
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
1% I urge this committee to not use our
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
children and our children's
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
lives to further your political power or
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that you think this bill
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
is doing because any way you look at
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
it this bill does not protect children
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
at harms
 
00:38:51.839 --> 00:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
at harms
children

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.109 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair and thank you for
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just want to
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
reiterate it's funny that you just
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that because I was just doing
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit of research and yeah so
 
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.550 align:start position:0%
a little bit of research and yeah so
basically

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
0% of under 18 gender affirming care
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
have any regrets correct so I just
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to double down on that and I
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate what is question I
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate what my colleague had
 
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
just said is suicide reversible no ma'am
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative please do not
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
ask frivolous childish questions we to
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
ask we are to ask the represent Su is
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
not frous it's an actual the question is
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculous it's not how is it ridiculous
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
when this bill will affect children
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
under do you not know that suicide is
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
not reversible did you not know that
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
before you came I just want to make sure
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's clear we ask questions I want to
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
make sure it's clear chairman she is my
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
constit I'm the constituent and I was
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
interested in her question thank you the
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
70 and before we go on just to be clear
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
the reason that the sponsor did not come
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
is the sponsor asked us to itl this bill
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
so before we everyone gets excited um
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:26.990 align:start position:0%

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
Youth considered suicide and 55%
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
reported uh feeling depression and these
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
numbers um are specific to New Hampshire
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
and clearly indicate the dangerous
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
territory we are in with youth mental
 
00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.079 align:start position:0%
health bills like these um contribute to
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh feelings of rejection and
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination in transgender Youth and
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
those feelings are tied to higher rates
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
of su suicidality self harm um isolation
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%

many other things early intervention and
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
treatment is critical to help reducing
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
those feel feelings of uh rejection and
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh discrimination and this can include
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
anything from those hormone replacement
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
therapies um therapeutic interventions
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
that representative Canon brought up and
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
um in very limited circumstances where
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's medically necessary transgender uh
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
I'm Excuse me um gender affirming
 
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries um when those medically
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
necessary treatments are administered to

health outcomes are on par with their um
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
cisgender counterparts so it's clear
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
from the data that these uh surgeries um
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
treatments and gender affirming Medical

an attorney with glad uh based in Boston

I'm a New Hampshire licensed attorney

and I am also um uh someone who
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
practices law in the area of access to
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
health care for transgender people um I
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
have extensive experience uh in
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
litigation and other areas of law
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
regarding access to healthare for
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
transgender people um I'd like to start
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
by pointing out that in 2018 this
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
legislature banned female genital
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
mutilation uh which is the basis for the
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill that we see here today I mean it's
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
the uh it's the preceding statute for
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that we see here today that was
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh enacted in response to an actual
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
problem involving a number not a large
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
number but a number of uh of young girls
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who had experienced
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
female genital mu mutilation connected
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
with ancestral ties to countries where
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's performed as a cultural norm this
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
bill does not address any such problem
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
and instead uses the dog whistle of
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
chemical castration which has become a
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
political term used to refer to the um
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
use of puberty blockers and hormone
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
therapy uh for for young people assigned
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
male at Birth uh to try to leverage the
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
same kind of concern about female GLE
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
mutilation and um apply it to other
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
children who experience gender dysphoria
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
I was hoping to hear from the sponsor
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
today because I wanted to hear directly
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
that this was the intent of the bill but
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
my inference is based on political usage
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the term nationally at this point in
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
time uh I'd like to take one moment to
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
note the sheer breadth of this bill
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
because uh in addition to the issues
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
around gender dysphoria treatment that
 
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
I've already mentioned uh this bill
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
would ostensibly ban chemotherapy for a
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
17-year-old with testicular cancer and
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
there is a safe haven for um for
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
surgical interventions that are
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect physical health but
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
those do not apply to uh to chemical
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
treatments such as
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy um so I just wanted to
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
point out that this bill is uh has has a
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
breath that is incomprehensible um but I
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
also just want to make the point to this
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
like legislature that while it is common
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
for uh for state legislatures to
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
regulate Medical Care and in fact it's
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
necessary for state legislators to take
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
on that role it is um unorthodox and
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
Incredibly incredibly inappropriate for
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature to Target one class of
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people for special regulation
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
of their access to Medical Care and
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
especially when it flies in the face of
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
established medical treatment that's
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
recognized by every single Major Medical
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
associ in the United
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
States I also want to note that uh in
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
this country right now we have seen a
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
number of states enact laws that block
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
access to health care for transgender
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
Youth and those laws exist in many
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
states and have been challenged in court
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
in many states and um among the states
 
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
that have seen Court challenges federal
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
judges have ruled that those uh those
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
laws are unconstitutional or likely
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in eight states federal
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
judges have ruled that way and that
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
includes federal judges who are
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
appointed by conservative presidents
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
including Donald Trump um on the other
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
hand only one federal court has ruled
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the opposite that a statute Banning
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
health care for transgender youth is uh
 
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.430 align:start position:0%
health care for transgender youth is uh
not

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so it is extremely
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
likely that this statute if it were to
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
be enacted um and any other statute that
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh that uh prohibits healthcare for
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
transgender youth it's likely that that
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
would be found unconstitutional by a
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
court will note that there are appell at
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
federal courts that are uh deciding the
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
cases um in different ways and it's not
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
consistent across the board so I don't
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
mean to State overstate uh what courts
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
are saying but um I just want to flag
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
this issue because there are serious
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional concerns not only based
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
on the equal protection rights of
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
transgender people in the United States
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
but also on the constitutionally
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
protected rights for parents to direct
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
the upbringing of their children which
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
includes the right to to access um uh
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
well established medical care for their
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
children uh finally I just want to raise
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
one more point before opening up to
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
questions which is the role of the
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
legislature in terms of access to care
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
for individuals in New Hampshire it's
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
not the role of the legislature to
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not you believe as
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
individuals what is appropriate for
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
miners to receive in terms of healthare
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
the question before you is whether it's
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the legislature to
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
disregard medical standards of care and
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
block access to health care and uh with
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
that I will answer any questions that
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
anyone has thank you for your testimony
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
um isn't it true the Supreme Court just
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
turned away an appeal um of a case I
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
forget which state but the the Lower
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that um a law Banning care
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional the state appealed
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
it and the and the Supreme Court turned
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
it away um I believe you're referring to
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
the Sketti case which arose out of
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and I um my latest information
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
was that the Supreme Court had not ruled
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they would hear I
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
think it was yesterday they turned it
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
away yesterday okay I didn't hear the
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
news but uh yeah thank you further
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
questions I representative
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question in
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
this committee we hear a lot of people
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
on both sides of issues uh talk about
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
constitutional reasons to do or to not
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
do things in your opinion what are the
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
Constitutional problems specifically
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
with this bill the Constitutional
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
problems arise under the 14th Amendment
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
to the US Constitution which has you
 
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.670 align:start position:0%
to the US Constitution which has you
know

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
multiple multiple Clauses that have um
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
you know multiple interpretations uh on
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
one hand there is the constitutionally
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
protected right to direct the upbringing
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
of one's children and that includes the
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
right to access medical care that your
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
children need if that Medical Care is
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
well established that is one area of
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional law that protects the
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
rights of um people to Access healthcare
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh another area is uh the right to equal
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
protection of the law when a law targets
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
one class of people for different
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
treatment the government looks at that
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
classification and determines whether or
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
not it is a suspect classification or
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
not a suspect classification determine
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
what level of scrutiny to apply when
 
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing the law when it's a sex-based
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
classification like the bill there's no
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
way to argue that this bill is not a
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
sex-based classification in fact it
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
explicitly targets uh targets targets
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
male uh people assign male at Birth and
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh additionally also um is going after
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
the type of care needed by transgender
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
people which is a sex-based
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
classification so by making a sex- based
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
classification uh there's heightened
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that's applied to uh the way
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
courts look at the law heightened
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
scrutiny would mean that there needs to
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
be an exceedingly persuasive
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
justification um and that there's not
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
more narrowly uh tailored options and
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
that's how the Constitution would apply
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
to review of a law like
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
this thank you for clarifying that
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question thank you for
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony I appreciate
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
Nafi good morning and thank you for
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony and I'll have a
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
answer for your question as well um my
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
name is Rabbi Robin Nafi I live in work
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
here in conquer I speak today on behalf
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
of myself as well as the members of the
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
Jewish clergy associ iation of New
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a number of reasons we
 
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 1011 as we understand the
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislation section 1A would make it a
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
crime for any person to circumcise a
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
male a minor male and section 1B would
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
make it a crime for a parent to direct
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
another to circumcise a minor male with
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
the exception in both sections of the
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
accepted practice of circumcision of the
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
foreskin at Birth with parental consent
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
this exception appears to be included so
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
that the biblically commanded and
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
long-standing practice of circumcision
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the Jewish Community does not
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
suddenly become a
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
crime while we appreciate the effort the
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
language fails for several reasons first
 
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
the biblical commandment to circumcise
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
male babies specifies that it shall be
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
done on the eighth day not at Birth if
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
at Birth is supposed to include the eth
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
day of life the lack of specificity
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
makes the language of the proposed
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
legislation too vague to withstand
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
scrutiny second Jewish law requires that
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
the circumcision be delayed if medically
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
necessary for example the baby is born
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
premature has jaundice is of low body
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
weight or even has an eye infection
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances the
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
circumcision is to take place only when
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
a medical professional deems it safe to
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
do so this is often weeks or even months
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
after the birth extremely premature
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
babies for example are are often in the
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
Neo neonatal intensive care unit for
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
months after birth and their
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision might not happen until they
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
are six or eight months
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
old third some Jewish male babies are
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
not circumcised for many reasons
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
including parental Choice those parents
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
may change their mind the child as he
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
grows up may want to be circumcised or
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
the child may need to be circumcised
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
before undertaking the Jewish right of
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
passage into Jewish adulthood called Bar
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
Mitzvah not of these would occur at
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
Birth fourth Jewish clergy are
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
occasionally approached by families
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
consisting of parents with their minor
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
children who wish to convert to Judaism
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
together or by older minors who wish to
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
convert and have their parents consent
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
in most denominations of judaism's male
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
both male males minors and adults would
 
00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
need to become circumcised rarely are
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
the minors in these situations
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
newborns furthermore if the males are
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
already circumcised when they seek to
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
convert Judaism requires a procedure
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
called hatat the spilling of a drop of
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
blood which takes place just here
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
whether this little known procedure
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
would be covered by the bill as it is
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
circumcision as I indicated I would
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
answer uh me also mention uh another
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional concern with this and
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
that obviously is the free exercise of
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
religion as as protected in the First
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment and for all of these reasons
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
the Jewish clergy Association of New
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire must oppose
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
hb101 I'm going to add add address what
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
we understand to be the true intent of
 
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:41.039 align:start position:0%
this bill to ban gender affirming
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
surgery to transgender youth when
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
focusing on just this aspect of the bill
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
the Jewish clergy Association of New
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire still opposes the legislation
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
in Genesis chapter 1 the creation of
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
humanity is called Bellum Elohim in the
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
image of God we believe that all genders
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
are created as such the highest
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
commandment or Mitzvah and Judaism that
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
one can undertake is Pak nees or saving

we so um if you've read the bill maybe
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%

passed in other states
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%

uh that have passed in a bipartisan

how neglect is defined and I think

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
different um you know parents were being
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
charged with neglect for uh letting
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
their kids walk to school
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
for um having their kids home learning
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
remotely while they went to work even
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
though they were forced to have that
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
happen um for using farm
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
equipment um or letting their kids use
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
farm equipment or
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
lawnmowers um so but this bill addresses
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
another serious charge in our state
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
which is endangering the welfare of a
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
child and in our state it's this law
 
01:11:36.629 --> 01:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's being used to turn parents into
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
criminals we need to clarify this law
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
right now the broadness of the statute
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
is allowing zealous prosecutors to
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
decide what child endangerment is while
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
leaving the waters muddied for
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
parents I know of a dad he's my
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
constituent um who let his teen daughter
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
carry a concealed pistol While She Was
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
Out on a walk and he was charged under
 
01:11:59.199 --> 01:11:59.870 align:start position:0%
Out on a walk and he was charged under
this

01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
section his daughter was proficient with
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
Firearms she'd been using them since a
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
very young age there were reports of
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
coyotes in the area and a neighbor had
 
01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
recently been attacked by a raccoon she
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
enjoyed a morning walk um but she wanted
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
to feel protected and being Adept in the
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
use safe use of a firearm her dad
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
allowed her to carry it conce FAL
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
nothing happened but unfortunately the
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
parents are divorced the mother later
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
found out and
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
disagreed and reported it and the father
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
was then charged with four counts of
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child which
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
was then all the charges were
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
dropped um we don't have any laws in
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
this state that prohibit um miners from
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
protecting themselves
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
and um but it it it's just an example of
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the law being open for interpretation
 
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.590 align:start position:0%
of the law being open for interpretation
for

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutors um to use against parents
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
for things that the legislature has not
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
declared to be crimes and it puts
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
prosecution prosecutors in the position
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
of making the law when we don't say what
 
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.350 align:start position:0%
of making the law when we don't say what
we

01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
mean um right now this La the current
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
law RSA 639 col 3 says um in uh part one
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
knowingly in
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
danger um is is one of the words that is
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
used there so there must be zero risk in
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
the parenting
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
decision um purposely it says
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
purposefully violating a duty of care
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
protection or support or inducing a
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
child to engage in conduct conduct that
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
endangers their health or safety this is
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
subjective if a prosecutor can use this
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
law to interfere with the constitutional
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense they can use it to
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
Target what Target whatever kind of
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
parenting they don't don't like and just
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
because you're not in your parenting
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
style and beliefs and values aren't in
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
the crosshairs right now it doesn't mean
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
that they can't be in the future if we
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't correct this
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
language um prosecutors are not parents
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
and they're not law makers they all have
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
parents all have different values
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
beliefs everyone assesses risk
 
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
differently and different parents can
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
look at the same statistical risk even
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
and interpret it as high or low and
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be different from another parent's
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
assessment of that risk based on their
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
values knowledge and beliefs so say as a
 
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
parent you decide to put a mask on your
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
kids right that's been shown to show to
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
have negative health effects you could
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
be charged under the right
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um if you let your older kids
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
babysit your younger kids you could be
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
charged keep your kids home for remote
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
learning while you're at work give your
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
kids life-saving medication or vaccine
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
that a prosecutor disapproves of let
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
your child walk to school it's risky
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
definitely not zero risk they could get
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
hit by a car you could be charged under
 
01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.629 align:start position:0%
hit by a car you could be charged under
this

01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
section um have a home birth maybe let
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
your child sit alone in a car it used to
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
be very common for even small children
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
to be alone in the car and was
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
considered safe things are changing now
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
and some states have laws on this but
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
our state does not so a parent could
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
look and say oh New Hampshire doesn't
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
have a law on this so I'm I'm clear to
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
make my own decision and then a
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutor can come along and
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily decide what age how long and
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
under what
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances that that's okay and when
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's not and that's our job that's not
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
Prosecutor's job if we want to make that
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
illegal we need to put in a bill and
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
make it illegal
 
01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.310 align:start position:0%
make it illegal
specifically

01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
um the maxims of law say it is a
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
wretched state of slavery which subsists
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
where the law is vague or
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
uncertain pretty serious another Maxim
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
says an act of legislature to have force
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
of law must must be intelligibly
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
expressed and when too vague is a
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
nullity so you can see there's probably
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
some issues with even Prosecuting these
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
when the law is vague if we think
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
certain parenting decisions should be
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
criminalized we need to spell them out
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
go through the full legislative process
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
so the inalienable rights of parents to
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
direct the upbringing of their children
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
can be weighed against an action with
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
due debate and recurrence to the
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution for guidance because that's
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
what we do like the previous bill so
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill has certain elements
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
to describe a parenting decision that's
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
the right of the parents to make and
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
exempting those from guilt and therefore
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
reducing frivolous prosecution the
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
courts can rule and set precedent but
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen that doesn't stop zealous
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
prosecutors or even entities in the
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
private realm from continuing to violate
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
people's rights so we can't just leave
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
this statute the way it is so people
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
find themselves blindsided fighting for
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
their rights in court when they never
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
should have been a
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
charge um I'm not married to the
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
language um I'm happy to work with
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
anyone on amendments if we want to find
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
tunit criminal code is not my usual
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
statutes that I work in so I know there
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
are different um nor normative um terms
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
and and structure and things like that
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm really happy and and would hope
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
that someone would reach out to me so I
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
can work on the language if there's any
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
issues um but every every decision in
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
parenting has some level of risk um so
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
if a parent can Dem can demonstrate that
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
all four of the elements that I require
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill um
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
then they can't be found guilty under
 
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
under the language of this bill so a if
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
there's no actual harm or if there is
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
harm by some unforeseen circumstance so
 
01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:37.719 align:start position:0%
that would be like walking to sto school
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
and getting hit by a car I don't believe
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that should be a criminal charge um
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
for letting your kid walk to school um B
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
if we want it to be illegal let's name
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
the crime let's describe it so parents
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
can know the ground rules let's weigh
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality of it in
 
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
legislative proceedings if the
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislature didn't name it and there are
 
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
some crimes described in this statute
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
specifically um such as branding a child
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
or soliciting a minor of SE for sex we
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
can name them let's name them we'll add
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
them here uh the parent see is the
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
parents can attest to the fact that they
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
made the decision consciously in weigh
 
01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
benefit versus risk and D the parent can
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
attest that the decision is in line with
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
their family values and make sense as a
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
decision for their family these are just
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
elements of making a parenting decision
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
that show that
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
you know you were conscious about it and
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
maybe your risk assessment was different
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
from someone else's but there was no
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
harm um there's a freerange child
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
movement growing as a result of research
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
on anxiety in children so there's a lot
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
of support for bills like this and
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
that's where a lot of the support um
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
came from in other states our research
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
is showing that kids who haven't had
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
more opportunities for Independence and
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
independent activities um have higher
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
anxiety and more social emotional
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
problems so there's lots of research on
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
that too which I'd be happy to get for
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
the committee and I'd be happy to take
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
any questions thank
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
you questions for the
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor represent
 
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
M do you believe that Society has a
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
fairly broad interest in protecting the
 
01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
children uh societ
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
as a whole I think that government has
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
an interest of protecting the
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of all people um
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
and if they're being violated that we
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
certainly have an interest to step in
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
and put some guard rails in place on how
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
to handle that absolutely followup
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
please follow up I I didn't ask about
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
their constitutional rights I asked
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
lives um I think no one has more
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
interest in the lives of children than
 
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.510 align:start position:0%
their parents

01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
definition of the word endangering or
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
the term duty of care therefore this
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
statute is null and void for
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%

taxpayers take notice the current
 
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
language of this statute just puts a lot
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
of unnecessary
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
litigation in the court systems as the
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%

welfare of a child statute is totally
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional if said statute is
 
01:24:23.550 --> 01:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
charged against someone where no injury
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%

being an injured party passing this bill
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
is a corrective action to fix a current
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
statute that is in conflict with the
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution not passing this bill will
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
continue to cause the people of New
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire irreparable harm and damage uh
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
directly in the form of uh parents being
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
wrongfully charged
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
and indirectly in the form of the
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
division of risk and benefit settling
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
claims against the state of New
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for constitutional rights
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
violations that arise out of people
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
being charged with the endangering the
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
welfare of a child statute where no
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
injury or harm has taken
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
place if you oppose this bill then I
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
have a question for you to ask yourself
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
where is the Constitutional authority to
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
bring a charge against one of the people
 
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
that could result in up to a year in
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
prison where there is not even a claim
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
of someone's rights being
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
violated thank you and I will take a
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
question if anybody has
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
one questions for the
 
01:25:39.109 --> 01:25:39.119 align:start position:0%
witness see none thank you for your
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
testimony this
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
morning um okay hold on SEC attorney
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
Enders would you be willing to let us
 
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
pick your brain after everyone else
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
testifies on this Bill thank
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.950 align:start position:0%
testifies on this Bill thank
you

01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
nardy so uh had an intended to testify
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
so I'll keep this very uh brief uh it
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
appears that there's a problem uh
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
currently in the
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislation where the line is not known
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
into what is potentially endangering
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
behavior and is not
 
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
and that line is being decided on an ad
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
hoc basis Case by Case by a bureaucrat
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
who is unaccountable to the people at
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
the moment it occurs which is going
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
along it appears political lines this is
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous the state house
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
needs to come up with a solution to this
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
so that parents will know what is
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
allowed and what is not allowed that
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
cannot be allowed to be made up on the
 
01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.189 align:start position:0%
cannot be allowed to be made up on the
spot

01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
by whoever happens to be there at that
 
01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
time because the penalties for being on
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
the wrong side of that line are dire and
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
putting a a parent in prison for a year
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
is not going to help the welfare of that
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
child it's going to make it worse so
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
this is a big opportunity for government
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
to actually do something to help make
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
things better as opposed to just
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
complicating and making the problem
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
worse so I mean I guess I could take a
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you for your
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning thank you ladies
 
01:27:20.199 --> 01:27:21.109 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning thank you ladies
and

01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
gentlemen the chair recognizes Michael
 
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.590 align:start position:0%
gentlemen the chair recognizes Michael
korski

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
korski
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
korski I should not do better on polish
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
can't Michael karki currently live in
 
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
hookit uh moved to New Hampshire a
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more than four years ago I
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
came to this country in 1990 from what
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
was still then Soviet
 
01:27:59.709 --> 01:27:59.719 align:start position:0%
Union uh one of the big problems in
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union was
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
that uh risk and uncertainty is uh
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
integral part of life you cannot avoid
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
it and when legislation is
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
unclear and decide decision what risks
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
are acceptable what actually acceptable
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
are not clear it becomes arbitrary so in
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union more in terms of production
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know people who were administering
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
Enterprises and so on uh in order to
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
work in order to produce to do the plan
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
you have to violate the law you cannot
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
do it otherwise so ever was a criminal
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
and everybody could be prosecuted at any
 
01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
point or fired for not doing the
 
01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
plan which is basically not not a
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
society you would want to live in there
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
it only was concerned of people who
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
production but for normal people there
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
were no such thing as politics people
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
were not in politics I did not know the
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know 50s the St time I was growing
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
in 1970s 80s which was you know kind of
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
brf's slow going you you keep silent
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
nobody would touch you and uh I know for
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure that people in America parents in
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
America live in much greater fear of
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
State than people in Soviet Union in
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
1980s and '90s and 70s probably because
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
the risks that were normal for
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
Generations the RIS that were know
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
acceptable few years ago suddenly
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
decided out of bounds and uh you could
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
get serious even if you get acquitted
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
you spend years and months you
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
get deprived from the right to see your
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
children you have to live separately you
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
have to spend Fortune to do something
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
that was considered normal years
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
ago and it's it's based on unclear
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
basically laws that doesn't specify the
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
boundaries and uh if we keep going this
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
way it will end up probably worse than
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
in Soviet Union because we have more
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
complexity there here than there and
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.390 align:start position:0%
complexity there here than there and
uh

01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
basically if law doesn't specify it it's
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
better to ER on the initiative of the
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
people or of the parents because if
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
people cannot judge their risks
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
themselves then how is democracy
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to work how it supposed to
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
elect someone who is supposed to do that
 
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:40.629 align:start position:0%
elect someone who is supposed to do that
for

01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
them so if the law is not clear it's
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
better to air on the side of initiative
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
and Liberty of the people then on safety
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
and removal of risk which is impossible
 
01:30:52.639 --> 01:30:54.990 align:start position:0%
and removal of risk which is impossible
thank

01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
Smith hello I'm Mary Smith uh of
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I'm here to
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
bill um thank you for your attention
 
01:31:31.239 --> 01:31:34.709 align:start position:0%
bill um thank you for your attention
chair

01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
others this bill as the previous
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
addresses a matter of vaguery that
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
currently exists in the
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
rsas um this has been adjudicated by the
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in New
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in a bunch of different
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
cases um but as part of my testimony I
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to quote to you one case State V
 
01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
bortner in
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
2004 that outlines why the Supreme Court
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
had not thrown this out on the grounds
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
that it is uh too vague could you repeat
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
the last name State V what a state V
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
bortner that is b o r t n r
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
2004 so in the uh in their opinion the
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
said uh contrary to the defendants
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
argument that the two men's rehea in
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
statute are in irreconcilable or
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
incompatible there are numerous ways in
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
which a person can purposely Act fail to
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
act without knowing it will endanger the
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
welfare of a child for example a parent
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
who fails to seek medical attention for
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
a child who sprains a finger may have
 
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
purposely violated a duty of care and
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
that that's an important just a part of
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
the Crux of this is the definition and
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
the understanding of what constitutes a
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
duty of care so back to the um uh the
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
um a parent who fails to seek medical
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
attention for a child who sprains a
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
finger may have purposely violated a
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
duty of care that that parent owes to
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
the child but since a sprained finger is
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
unlikely to cause death or Serious
 
01:33:41.310 --> 01:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
injury it is possible that the parent
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
did not knowingly endanger the welfare
 
01:33:47.310 --> 01:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
of the child on the other hand a parent
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
who fails to promptly seek medical
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
attention for a child child who stops
 
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
breathing may have purposely violated a
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
duty of care in addition the parent may
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
have knowingly endangered the welfare of
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
a child due to the high risk of death or
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
Serious injury that is likely to result
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
these examples demonstrate that the two
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
separate men's Rea of knowingly and
 
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
purposely are not necessarily
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
irreconcilable or incompatible we thus
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
clude that the statute is sufficiently
 
01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
clear to warn the average person of the
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited conduct and that the
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
coexistence of the purposely and
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly is does not render the statute
 
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.870 align:start position:0%
knowingly is does not render the statute
impermissibly

01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
impermissibly
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
vague so that's just a section of that
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
um and I just like to point out that uh
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
if the law if as the prosecutors are uh
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
pursuing it
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
um was
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
as the uh Supreme Court of New Hampshire
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
defined here in this case uh
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
then I don't think I would be as
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
motivated or many others would be as
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
motivated to talk to this bill
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
today um but we are here today because
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
that's not how the law is currently
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
being applied to parents across the
 
01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire where there are
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
plenty of behaviors that are nowhere
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
close to a high risk of death or Serious
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
injury or a medium risk of death or
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
Serious injury or a moderately low risk
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
of serious death or injury where they
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
are being charged by prosecutors for
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
conduct that is is otherwise like less
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
risky than driving their children to a
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
location I mean driving is one of the
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous activities we engage
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
in on a regular basis and some of these
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
behaviors that parents are being
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for uh under this statute
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
unchanged are not even close to
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous in the way that driving on the
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
public roadways is and the risks that
 
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
that carries so um that's why I'm in
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I mean it's it's
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
clear it moves the the standard from
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
duty of care to actual harm or injury
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
with additional uh criteria it's not
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
just that it also includes that the
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
parents would also H or Guardians would
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
articulate um like a a reasoning as to
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
the risk or benefit of allowing the
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
children to do whatever the behavior was
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
or the conduct they engaged in so I I
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
really encourage you if you have any uh
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
problems uh with this for which you
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
don't think uh I would be good to answer
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
your questions please instead of voting
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
to um itl this bill or recommending to
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
itl the bill please consider working
 
01:37:09.239 --> 01:37:10.070 align:start position:0%
itl the bill please consider working
with

01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
representative um kushman on it for
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you think the issue is because
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
this this needs to be cleared up so
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
maybe if you don't like the language or
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
you want to see it uh clarified in some
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
way I I encourage you to work with her
 
01:37:25.229 --> 01:37:25.239 align:start position:0%
but I like the language as it is uh I'm
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
willing to take any
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um do you have any
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
examples of um you said that it's being
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
used to prosecute any further examples
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
than what we've already
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
heard uh I think the examples you've
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
are uh pretty clear um I actually didn't
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
know about the one of uh I guess a
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
father recently who had this uh issue
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
where he thought it would be the prudent
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
thing to do to give his his daughter a
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
um a firearm for her walk out um I don't
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
know I wasn't in those circumstances I
 
01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that um I'm aware of many
 
01:38:03.639 --> 01:38:05.430 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that um I'm aware of many
cases

01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
of uh parents
 
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.310 align:start position:0%
of uh parents
whose

01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
um their custody of their children has
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
been threatened because of leaving their
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
children in the car for example when
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
they go into the store um from my
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
personal experience when I looked at the
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
any data I I could whatever data was
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
available on how many children have died
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh because of heat stroke or anything
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
related to being left in the car when a
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
parent goes to uh the store because I
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe the kid's sleeping or
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
something like that um I could not find
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
a single case there there are um in New
 
01:38:50.679 --> 01:38:52.149 align:start position:0%
a single case there there are um in New
Hampshire

01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
of a child
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
dying um and this is not because of the
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
laws we have there there are other
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
states that have laws explicitly against
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
this Behavior and the numbers of child
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
deaths are higher in those States um so
 
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
it was over the past 50 years I couldn't
 
01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
find a single example just just for that
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
behavior um that parents are being
 
01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
prosecuted over and and bring being
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
brought to court over um so there's also
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the question of allowing your children
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
to um walk to the store by themselves or
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
walk to school by themselves that
 
01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.510 align:start position:0%
walk to school by themselves that
unfortunately

01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
parents are being prosecuted over here
 
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so um do you have any
 
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so um do you have any
other

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.350 align:start position:0%
other
questions

01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
um I was just curious if you could share
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
with the committee under what
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances do you think it is
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the state to intervene
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances outlined in representative
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
kushman's Bill are pretty
 
01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.790 align:start position:0%
kushman's Bill are pretty
good

01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
where it isn't just that actual harm har
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
or injury has occurred but also that
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
parents are unable to articulate any
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
sort of reason cost benefit or that it
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
is in in alignment with their values so
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
it could be the case that um there was a
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
behavior that could have caused a lot of
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
harm to the
 
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.159 align:start position:0%
children but didn't
 
01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
luckily that would not uh pass the
 
01:40:52.109 --> 01:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of the criteria in
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative kushman's bill because
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
when the parents are asked the parents
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
give lousy
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
reasons or reasons that don't indicate
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
that there was any sort of cost benefit
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
analysis done of the uh safety of the
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior Uh versus the risks that it
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
posed so uh that is an excellent
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
question and that is one that is
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
addressed directly by representative
 
01:41:20.159 --> 01:41:21.669 align:start position:0%
addressed directly by representative
kushman's

01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
kushman's
 
01:41:21.679 --> 01:41:25.709 align:start position:0%
kushman's
um

01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh no further questions
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
7y good morning again my name is msv I'm
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
the children's Behavior Health policy
 
01:41:47.589 --> 01:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
coordinator at new futures um I signed
 
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill um I just I
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
just spoke spoke with representative
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
kushman about my concerns about the
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
language um and hopefully we'll work
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
something out with her so I don't feel
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
that my testimony that I had planned was
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
necessary at this point so at this point
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
new Futures has no position on the bill
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
um as the bill stands it we are opposed
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
to it okay but representative wheeler
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
has a quick question what was your
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
objection to the language thank you Mr
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
just uh we are in support of any bill
 
01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
that is uh using evidence-based
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
practices for for reducing um poor
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes for children um
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
and so I just think there is a maybe
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
more appropriate space in our state
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
legis legislation um that would would be
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
able to accomplish that the goal of
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
Representative kushman um as it pertains
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the Freer range kids movement um that
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
may not open up the child endangerment
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
statute thank
 
01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%

01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
chair and the committee would like to
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
Avail ourselves of your
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
expertise Could you um give us two
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
things could you tell us how often you
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
see this prosecuted m in your particular
 
01:43:38.669 --> 01:43:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh court and what if any opinion you
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
have on how this were this to become
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
law if it would cause problems or
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
not thank you for the record my name is
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
Steven Andis I'm an attorney at the
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
marac County Attorney's Office I'm an
 
01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney I've been a
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for over 20 years now um with
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
reference to how often we see this
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
charge certainly as a circuit court
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor prosecutor I saw
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to say often but we
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
certainly did see endangering the
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
welfare of minor
 
01:44:10.239 --> 01:44:11.830 align:start position:0%
welfare of minor
charges

01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
um I when I think about sort of criminal
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
law and law in general Behavior really
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
exists on a spectrum and on one side of
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
that Spectrum you have sort of Ideal
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
behavior that we all strive to to
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
emulate you have sort of the the perfect
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
person and then next to the perfect
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
person you have you know acceptable
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
behavior encouraged Behavior you
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
have um maybe not encouraged Behavior
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
but behavior that is societally
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
acceptable and I always think think in
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
terms of examples like going out for a
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
drink after work with your co-workers
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
maybe isn't necessarily societally
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
encouraged Behavior but is acceptable in
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
our society then you have behavior that
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
is is frowned upon in our society and
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
the example I always give is if you're
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
Seated on a Subway or or something like
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
that and a a pregnant woman comes on our
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
society encourages you to give up your
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
seat to to the pregnant woman that's and
 
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't that's sort of frowned
 
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
upon then further over we have you know
 
01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.430 align:start position:0%
upon then further over we have you know
unacceptable

01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
unacceptable
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
behavior um Behavior where you're going
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
to get sued perhaps civil and then
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
further over there's this line somewhere
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
where that behavior becomes criminal and
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
then in the criminal side you have class
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanors Class B misdemeanors and
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
felonies so what's hard is that conduct
 
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.870 align:start position:0%
felonies so what's hard is that conduct
really

01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:45:54.030 --> 01:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
exists on that
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
Spectrum in it depends on where you are
 
01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of societal norms and it also
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
depends on when you're living in
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
history and the endangering the welfare
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
of a minor statute I think really points
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
points that out that my understanding is
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
that there are countries in the world
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
where people leave their children home
 
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
alone and go out to dinner and that's
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
the norm my understanding is there's
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
countries in the world where you know
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
people leave children in baby carriages
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
in front of the store and go in and
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's the norm that's not necessarily
 
01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.070 align:start position:0%
that's the norm that's not necessarily
acceptable

01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
here and it also as I was saying depends
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
on when you are in history in terms of I
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
know that you know I grew up in a time
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
when we only had lap belts in the car
 
01:46:46.589 --> 01:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
and helmets were sort of unknown to us
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that's just was acceptable at the
 
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
time whereas now that would be frowned
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
upon or maybe even cross into that
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
criminal world so I think it's hard when
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
you look at the behavior of parents
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
regarding their children to sort of
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
figure out am I looking at bad parenting
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
or am I looking at criminal behavior in
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
violation of the endangering the welfare
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
of a minor statute and for me when I
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
look at this statute it it does use the
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
term purposely violating a duty of care
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
protection or
 
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
support and purposely is defined in RSA
 
01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:25.510 align:start position:0%
support and purposely is defined in RSA
6262

01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
6262
 
01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:27.070 align:start position:0%
6262
as

01:47:27.070 --> 01:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
um a person acts purposely with respect
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
to a material element in offense when
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
his conscious object is to cause the
 
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
result or engage in the conduct that
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
comprises the
 
01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:38.910 align:start position:0%
comprises the
element

01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
element
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
so in my opinion to violate the
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
endangering welfare of a child statute
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
your purpose your conscious object has
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
to be to violate the duty of care you
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
and where we've seen this occur and
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
where we've prosecuted it in the past is
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've had individuals who are driving
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
drunk with their kids in the
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
car you you know you have a duty of care
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
to your children and when you put them
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the car and you're intoxicated and
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're driving you're purposely
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
violating that duty of care so I do
 
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
think that in those circumstances and
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child
 
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.790 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child
charge

01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:22.229 align:start position:0%
charge
is

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate we've also seen it where um
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
we had a person who was using drugs and
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
um tried to cook something I don't
 
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
remember what it was but essentially set
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
her house on fire and passed out um from
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
a drug overdose with her children in the
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
house we charged that individual with
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a minor
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
because we felt that she purposely
 
01:48:52.589 --> 01:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
violated duty to care to her
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
child uh we have a case that I believe
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
is pending now where a woman hid her
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
children in the closet and were alleging
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
that she then set her house on fire um
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
when the fire department showed up she
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
didn't mention anything about having
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
children in the house the firefighters
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
actually found the the children hiding
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the in in the house um we charged her
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
with endangering the welfare of a minor
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
because again we felt that was an
 
01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.109 align:start position:0%
because again we felt that was an
appropriate

01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
charge I have also um charged people for
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
leaving children in cars and I can think
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
of a case I had where an individual who
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
was not from New Hampshire was visiting
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because his father was was
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
dying in uh was in hospice and I believe
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
hookit was staying in a hotel in conquer
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
with a uh I think it was an
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
eight-year-old son and when his father
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
passed away in the middle of the night
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
he left to go to to hookit to check on
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
things I don't know if you didn't
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
realize how far hookit was from
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
conquered but left his eight-year-old
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
child alone in a hotel room uh for at
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately several
 
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.229 align:start position:0%
unfortunately several
hours

01:50:07.229 --> 01:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
um we did charge him with endangering
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
the welfare of a
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
minor the other sort of piece to this
 
01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:16.750 align:start position:0%
minor the other sort of piece to this
though

01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
is the resolution of these cases
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
between a person well in someone had
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
brought up the example of your child
 
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
sprains their finger and
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
essentially um whether you seek medical
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
care for your child with a sprain finger
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I think the answer to that one
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is it depends when you
 
01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
6393 subsection five it talks
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
about um I'm sorry subsection four
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
it talks about a person who pursuant to
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
the tenants of a recognized religion
 
01:50:56.069 --> 01:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
fails to conform to an otherwise
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
existing duty of care is not guilty of
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
an offense under this section so if
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
you're not seeking medical care because
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
you're part of an organized religion
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seek medical care for
 
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
sprained fingers you're not guilty of a
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
crime under this section if you're not
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
seeking medical care because you know
 
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
you want to watch the Food Network and
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
you've got better things to do than take
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
your child to the emergency room I I
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
think you could potentially face charges
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
under this
 
01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.470 align:start position:0%
under this
section

01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
but as a prosecutor when we're getting
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
charges it it's always sort of been my
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
opinion that
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's parents aren't generally trying
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
to hurt their children I mean we've
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
certainly had cases where parents are
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
affirmatively trying to hurt their
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
children and they should be sentenced
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
appropriately but a lot of the cases
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
that we get where it's you know if a
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
parent's leaving a child in a room alone
 
01:52:00.069 --> 01:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
um leaving the child in a car it's not
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily that they're trying to hurt
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
the child it's that they don't know any
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
better and I think charging someone with
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a minor may
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
be a wakeup call certainly I've
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
referred cases I want to say the
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
individual in the hotel room who left
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
his child alone my recollection in that
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
case is that we resolved it by referring
 
01:52:26.069 --> 01:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
him to do a parenting class through a
 
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
diversion program because I don't think
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
he's trying to hurt his kid I think he
 
01:52:32.589 --> 01:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
just didn't know any better that he
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't leave his kid in the hotel
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
room so I think sentencing does come
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
into that
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that answers it was
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
very helpful thank you generally um if
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
you could uh have there been referrals
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
you see have received from perhaps from
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
DCF that you declin to
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
prosecute so as a prosecutor we received
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
cases from the police departments um
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're not out actively you know
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
investigating crime necessarily we're
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
sitting behind our desk and we wait for
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
the police to come drop the case on the
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
desk and say prosecute this
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't necessarily receive
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
criminal complaints from DCF normally
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
DCF would notify the police department
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the police Department would do an
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
investigation um we may get the the case
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
from the police department whenever
 
01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
there's a child involved the police
 
01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:30.679 align:start position:0%
department and DCF work together
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
initially so it it wouldn't be uncommon
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
for the police to notify dcyf or DCF to
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
notify the
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
police and generally speaking if a
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
charge is brought by the police you do
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
bring you do more forward with
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
charges generally generally yes yes
 
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
certainly I can say for me personally
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
especially with endangering Weare of a
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
minor I've always taken sort of a
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
critical look at those cases because I
 
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
do think
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a gray area where there's bad
 
01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
parenting and then there's a line where
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
that bad parenting becomes criminal
 
01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.109 align:start position:0%
that bad parenting becomes criminal
conduct

01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I always sort of want to make sure
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
I'm in the criminal conduct line of that
 
01:54:20.199 --> 01:54:21.830 align:start position:0%
I'm in the criminal conduct line of that
gray

01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
gray
 
01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.470 align:start position:0%
gray
area

01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to I'm going to allow
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
questions um generally speaking he he um
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
kind of got trapped into this so let's
 
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
keep the
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
questions non-confrontational as
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
possible I was going to say you can
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
throw me hard questions it's fine you
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
all right represent uh
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
seig thank you so much and thank you for
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
um if I may uh give a hypothetical an
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
Ask word that would fall on under this
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation um just so that I
 
01:54:56.109 --> 01:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
can have a greater understanding so I I
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
have a 16-year-old and you know
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes we headbutt as is not uncommon
 
01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
with 16y olds and their their mothers um
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
so if I believed as a system of
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
discipline that the appropriate thing to
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
do would be to lock her in her bedroom
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
for 4 days with a bucket for waste and
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple bottles of water um
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
but because I believe that was going to
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
help teach her the discipline necessary
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
to not speak to me the way she did or
 
01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
behave the way she did and I I truly
 
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
believe that that is my parenting
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
decision intended to encourage their
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
independence and freedom um where where
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
would you view that under so and if I
 
01:55:40.109 --> 01:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
did that regularly um how would that
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
this I do know that the New Hampshire
 
01:55:47.709 --> 01:55:47.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court recently came out with a
 
01:55:49.229 --> 01:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
case I don't know the name of it off the
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
top of my head but it involved a parent
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
locking a child in a room or they were
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
locked from the outside so the child
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't leave the room um there were no
 
01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:03.639 align:start position:0%
bathroom facilities in the room and the
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court did find that that was
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a minor part
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
of the reason they found that was
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
because the parent was unavailable
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
should there be an emergency since it
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
was locked from the outside the kid
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
I would have to look at the facts of
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
what you're doing in in for me
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
personally the first thing I would do if
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
I was handed that case would be to
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
reread the Supreme Court case and see
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
exactly why they felt the way they
 
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
did I would also be concerned in your
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
situation about the child's access to
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
essentially being able to get out if
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
there was in fact an
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
emergency if your system of Parental
 
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
discipline is to lock the child in the
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
room for 4 days and you have some good
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
faith you know basis for doing that and
 
01:57:00.669 --> 01:57:00.679 align:start position:0%
that's your your parenting
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
style I don't know that that crosses the
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
line too endangering for me as long as
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
there were safeguards in place where if
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
there was an emergency the child could
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
communicate with you could get out of
 
01:57:16.069 --> 01:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
thing representative Stone thank you
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for my question uh one of the
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
current languages this bills that's
 
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
being proposed do you find it to be a
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
huge hindrance in prosecution from your
 
01:57:26.599 --> 01:57:28.830 align:start position:0%
huge hindrance in prosecution from your
your

01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
perspective part of the language of the
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
current bill that that I'm I wouldn't be
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
in favor of is the the first line about
 
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
there is no actual injury or harm or any
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
actual injury or harm is the result of
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
unavoidable or unforeseeable accident
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason I would have a problem
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
with that is to me that's sort of the no
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
harm no foul language and the difficulty
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
with that is when you're talking about
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
children and risking injury to a
 
01:58:04.229 --> 01:58:04.239 align:start position:0%
child I think I'd rather see law
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement be proactive than reactive
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
I'd rather see a child in a situation
 
01:58:12.069 --> 01:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
where perhaps they could get hurt having
 
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement intervene before the
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
child gets hurt to say we're going to
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
stop this rather than waiting for the
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
child to get hurt and then saying well
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
we you shouldn't have done this to begin
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
with so I I don't like the language in
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh in paragraph
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
a the rest of the language I don't
 
01:58:37.030 --> 01:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily have an an objection to for
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
me personally and again I think it it
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
almost mirrors the current Statute in
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
terms of there's a uh an exception for
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
conforming to an organized religion and
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think saying a
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
a parenting
 
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
decision is is almost akin to me to an
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
organized religion if you have sort of
 
01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.709 align:start position:0%
organized religion if you have sort of
an

01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
intelligent backing up of that parenting
 
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your time yeah thank
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
you any further Witnesses who haven't
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
testified who wish to testify on the
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
where oh you should have asked just go
 
01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
ask opening the public hearing on House
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 1017 invite the sponsor to come
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.239 --> 02:00:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Belcher Carol County
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
4 weak field uh I have the pleasure here
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
this is my first time I believe before
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
this committee um so I'd like to
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
recommend my bill that does several
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
things regarding uh sheriffs in this
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
state their uh their abilities their
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
Authority and their responsibilities um
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
first thing I've done is that I have
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
brought in language that exists
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in New Hampshire law that
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
provides Mayors with the authority to in
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
an emergent basis
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
um deputi or whatever the proper
 
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
language is there to bring in persons in
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
an official capacity to put down breach
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
of the piece if it were to be
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
necessary uh I believe that as the
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
highest law enforcement official in the
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
county that sheriffs should also have
 
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
that same capacity um that Mayors
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
do in order to affect that change and
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
make it not conflict with certain laws
 
02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.709 align:start position:0%
make it not conflict with certain laws
regarding

02:01:19.709 --> 02:01:19.719 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
Deputy sheriffs I have modified some
 
02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
language in minor ways and added a new
 
02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
section that breaks out Deputy sheriffs
 
02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
into two distinct categories currently
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
Deputy sheriffs under law exist
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
primarily for the service of process
 
02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
they're compensated under under special
 
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh guidelines and that's all retained
 
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill uh it then breaks out a
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
second category of special Deputy that
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
would be this again on an emerging basis
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
in order to put down breaches of the
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
piece something that could be done
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
immediately uh without significant
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
see the third item that this bill does
 
02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
is a substantial addition to the duties
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
of the sheriff and his deputies
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
now don't think it would show come as a
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
shock to most people on this committee
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot of um a lot of
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
is issues and a lot of controversy
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
surrounding federal law enforcement in
 
02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.510 align:start position:0%
surrounding federal law enforcement in
recent

02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
recent
 
02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:33.719 align:start position:0%
time from the FBI to the
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
cpb they've been under heightened
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
scrutiny scrutiny for actions that have
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
been perceived by the
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
public it very much appears to me that
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
Doctrine within federal law
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement has shifted in recent times
 
02:02:54.069 --> 02:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
to preferring high-risk tactical
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
operations in service of warrants often
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
utilizing explosive breaching deployment
 
02:02:59.599 --> 02:03:01.109 align:start position:0%
utilizing explosive breaching deployment
of

02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
flashbangs and it's moved away from the
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
more historical practices where they
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
would utilize maximum
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
deconfliction and maximum avoidance of
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
violence the
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
result from coast to coast has been an
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
increase in people killed in the service
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
of federal
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
warrants and an awful lot of
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
people that have had guns pointed at
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
justification as was historical practice
 
02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
in this country for a very long time in
 
02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.270 align:start position:0%
in this country for a very long time in
many

02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
states it was up to the local County
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
Sheriff to know what was going on in
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
their County and to be a part of of the
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement actions that were
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
happening so this bill places the
 
02:03:56.910 --> 02:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
additional duty on the Sheriff's Office
 
02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:58.430 align:start position:0%
additional duty on the Sheriff's Office
to

02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
observe but not participate directly
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the service of uh Federal warrants
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
and arrests and federal police actions
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of trying to protect
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
resident now somebody asked me a while
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
back so I'll address this right away
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
would that prevent them from if somebody
 
02:04:25.470 --> 02:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
starts shooting at them doing anything
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
no absolutely not once you're getting
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
shot at you're no longer strictly just
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
in a law enforcement action you're in a
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
self-defense situation so that this
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
would not prevent The Taking of action
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
that finally it has been expressed to me
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
that there is some resistance regarding
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
perceived conflicting law on special
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
deputies while I don't entirely agree
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
with the interpretation I would ask the
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee that at the end of the day if
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
the section of this bill on special
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
deputies winds up being the sticking
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
point I would lend my support to an
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to strip that part out or even
 
02:05:07.310 --> 02:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
to split the question on the house floor
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
because the portion of observing federal
 
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
police actions is of utmost importance
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
to me thank you I'd be happy to take
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um what do you see
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
the role of the of the sheriffs who are
 
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
there so let's we're going to have to
 
02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
take it hypothetical a hypothetical the
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
um ATF is serving a warrant the
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
sheriff's hypothetically get notified of
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
it and they go in their role as
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
observers and they observe what they
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
deem to be a violation of the person's
 
02:05:44.589 --> 02:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
rights what are they supposed to
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
do well first I I believe that they
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be far less likely to be a
 
02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
violation of that person's rights in the
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
presence of a local representative of
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
the sheriff however if there were to be
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
what would appear to be a clear
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
violation of law I I would expect them
 
02:06:07.629 --> 02:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately I think that you you
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
run into a Supremacy issue if they're in
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
servicing if they're serving a f a
 
02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
federal uh warrant issued by a federal
 
02:06:17.719 --> 02:06:20.189 align:start position:0%
federal uh warrant issued by a federal
judge

02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
judge
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to see if that would
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
even I I'll have to research how that
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
would work out understood um further
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative Stone thank you
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are you
 
02:06:31.549 --> 02:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
aware of any cases in New Hampshire
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
where local authorities either municipal
 
02:06:36.189 --> 02:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
or County or state isn't involved with
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
the execution of federal
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
warrants I am not aware of any where
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
they're not involved I am also not aware
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
of any when their involvement does not
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
include participating in the service of
 
02:06:50.109 --> 02:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
the warrant as opposed OS to being there
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
as on behalf of the resident to assure
 
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
their rights are
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
protected thank
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
you are you aware of any other states
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
that have done
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
this as far as this type of Statute I am
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
not aware of any other states that are
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
have this in statute at the moment I am
 
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
aware that this was common practice in
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
the United States broadly up at least
 
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
until the early to mid 20th century
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative
 
02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you Mr chairman
 
02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I have several questions and I'll try
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
to limit them uh section one of your
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill deals with special Deputy
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
sheriffs um I recognize that present law
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
says a deputy shall not take any action
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
until their name is recorded by the
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
clerk and you've nullified that
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for special Deputy um one of
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
the questions that I have in relation to
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
that is are you aware of RSA 5
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
946 uh entitled Aid to officers which
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
states every law enforcement officer
 
02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
encounters a need for assistance in the
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
ex execution of his office in a criminal
 
02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:01.719 align:start position:0%
case or emergency situation may require
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
any person to render suitable Aid any
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
person who when so required neglects or
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
refuses to give such Aid shall be guilty
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
of a violation are you aware of that
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
law I I've been vaguely aware of that
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
law but I I don't see anywhere that law
 
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
conflicts with what I've put forward as
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
in cir cumstances that are emergent they
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
would not be prohibited from taking
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
necessary action they would only be
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited from participating in the
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
underlying law enforcement action for
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the that the federal officers are
 
02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:31.149 align:start position:0%
that the that the federal officers are
undertaking

02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
undertaking
 
02:08:32.910 --> 02:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
followup one
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I'm not
 
02:08:38.549 --> 02:08:38.559 align:start position:0%
saying that it conflicts with what you
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
proposing I'm saying that there's no
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
need for what you're proposing because
 
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
it's already in statute is that that's
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding do you believe that to
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
be true as well that would not be my
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
inter interpretation of that
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
Muse I'm
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you again for taking my
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
question uh what law currently prohibits
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
any sherff from a special deputizing an
 
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
service what law prevents them from
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
doing so in a manner that would be
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
allowed them to operate immediately in
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
the event of a breach of the Peace um
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
that would be the section on um that
 
02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
requires the reporting to the court
 
02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
before they're allowed to take any
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
action which is what's repeated on this
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
or changed follow up the office of
 
02:09:35.709 --> 02:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
sheriff is elected official correct yes
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
so if they do a deputization of an
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
individual that person's powers are
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:46.189 align:start position:0%
 
deputized

02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
deputized
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
correct that is not the interpret ation
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
that I was given uh in speaking with a
 
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
sheriff just moments ago nor is nor is
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
it how I read the law
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
testifying thank you represent Muse
 
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
again thank you for taking my
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
question what sort of training do you
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
envision for these uncompensated
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
deputies the training there is no
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
training requirement because this is an
 
02:10:13.629 --> 02:10:13.639 align:start position:0%
emergent process something that is done
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
in in a situation where there is a true
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
need to to regain if we're talking about
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
something like Insurrection we're
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
talking about a real problem that needs
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with right now and they
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the Personnel we don't have
 
02:10:26.549 --> 02:10:26.559 align:start position:0%
time to put people through the police
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
academy hopefully there will be people
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
such as veterans maybe even XMS who can
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
circumstance see no further questions
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
noon

02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh hearing my comments uh
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
I support this bill uh with respect to
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh federal law law enforcement being
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
required to um I'm sorry with respect to
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh federal law enforcement um doing
 
02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
whatever they may be doing uh that the
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh Sheriff be required to participate or
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
or or or be there and I believe that uh
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear example that the the
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
feds have become pretty uh polarized in
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
my lifetime
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
anyways um we have the examples of just
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
recently past couple years uh January 6
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
where people's homes are being raided
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
that just were mulling around the capito
 
02:11:37.149 --> 02:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
building um uh you know by the FBI and
 
02:11:41.430 --> 02:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
these agencies and the um and obviously
 
02:11:43.229 --> 02:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
there was people in January 6 who you
 
02:11:44.910 --> 02:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
know that particular event who had broke
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
the law uh and you know probably need to
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
be you know dealt with and do need to be
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
dealt with but there's just people who
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
are just hanging around and to where the
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
um having the sheriff be there when the
 
02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
feds are doing something I feel is
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
important because the sheriff is the is
 
02:12:02.109 --> 02:12:02.119 align:start position:0%
a constitutional officer he is the
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
highest lawful Authority on the county
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh from my what my understanding is a
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
sheriff uh has a higher authority than
 
02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
the president than any any any federal
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
agent agency or agent within his County
 
02:12:17.790 --> 02:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
and should definitely be present when a
 
02:12:21.069 --> 02:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
federal Authority uh is involved in
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
doing whatever they're doing Serving a
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
warrant uh whatever and also this is an
 
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
added protection because um Sheriff's uh
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
would would likely maybe if anybody in
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is going to know like
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
the local people it's probably not going
 
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
to be the federal agents but it quite
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
possibly would be you know the sheriff
 
02:12:44.549 --> 02:12:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh and also I would encourage everybody
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
to go shake their Sheriff's hand and
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself to him so he does
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
know know who you are
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and you know we have uh I I believe
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
an overzealous um you know sort of
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
radicalized uh federal government
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
anyways and uh the sheriff sheriff could
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
act as a buffer to any of uh you know
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
you see no questions thank you for your
 
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
testimony chair
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
Wright good
 
02:13:31.549 --> 02:13:31.559 align:start position:0%
morning chairman Roy and members of this
 
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Sheriff Bill Wright I'm
 
02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Sheriff's
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
counties I'm also the sheriff of belnap
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
County and I'm in my second term now uh
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
all all counties are represented
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
within the sheriff's Association at this
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
given time with the exceptions of uh the
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
vote if you will from uh straford County
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
which is which I believe is a vacant
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
seat right
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
now the New Hampshire Sheriff's
 
02:14:02.350 --> 02:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
Association uh so all nine of us
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
sheriffs are opposed to House Bill
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
1017 we believe that this bill would
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
create uh some liabilities to our County
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
for each person that sworn in under this
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
manner and purpose we believe that uh
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
these people would no training no
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
formalized training uh as a certified
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer uh creates his
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
own problems in the way that the current
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
Society is uh here in New Hampshire and
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
across the country we do believe that
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
this uh presents problematic uh
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
processes for us in the
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
future not being certified police
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
officers here in the state of New
 
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would mean that they have zero
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
arrest Powers so even if I was to swear
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
somebody in under a posi type uh
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
legislation they they have no rest
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
Powers uh therefore rendering uh this
 
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
conversation kind of moot um we
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand what the intentions of this
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill is but as it's written it would
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
create more liability and goes against
 
02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:02.559 align:start position:0%
what the state has put in place for
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for us to actually become
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
certified police
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
officers we have a couple statutes that
 
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
are currently in place RSA 104 is what
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
exclusively covers sheriffs uh under RSA
 
02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
1043 which is deputies an appointment it
 
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
talks about uh deputization under the
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
hand of the sheriff in that uh that they
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
cannot take action until it's recorded
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh at the Superior Court which again I'm
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing not reading the the statute
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
completely RSA
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
10412 which is requiring Aid so we have
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
the ability to request the aid of
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who happens to be in our
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
presence to help us uh do our process
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
which in essence is kind of what this
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do I guess in some
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
manner but again arrest Powers uh we we
 
02:15:51.709 --> 02:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
don't assert our authority to make
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
arrest Powers they're actually helping
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
us do something which would in my
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
opinion be that we are physically
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
present uh needing the help I.E
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
wrestling somebody on the side of the
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
road trying to get them into
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
custody we also have RSA 10427 which is
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh Deputy discharge so it requires us
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
sheriffs that if we do make an
 
02:16:15.069 --> 02:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
appointment that anytime a deputy leaves
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
office in other words they resign quit
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh or we terminate them we have to serve
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
them with a um with an
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
actual discharge paperwork that
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
indicates that they're no longer um on
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
the Sheriff's Office on top of that
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA 10428 it talks about the
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
liabilities for deputies conduct not
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
only is the county on the hook for the
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the liability of the deputies the
 
02:16:41.389 --> 02:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
sheriff themselves are personally liable
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
for each employee and as soon as I uh
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
swear somebody in they become my
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
problem I had read an article earlier
 
02:16:55.870 --> 02:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
about uh establishing a
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
posi and
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
um I found it in business 2 Community
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
which uh was updated on July 7th 2023
 
02:17:09.389 --> 02:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
and the article uh was put in there by
 
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
Connor Brooke and it talks about um posi
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
members and the government and uh how it
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
opens basically the government up for
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
liabilities if we were to just uh start
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
swearing people in and that they were to
 
02:17:26.349 --> 02:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
automatically start operating as quas
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
police or or Deputy sheriffs um and it
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
was said in this article that uh that we
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
need to look at uh the liability both
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
between the civil and criminal aspect uh
 
02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
as it relates to these people and there
 
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
was a quote in there it says if a
 
02:17:42.830 --> 02:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
civilian were to be shot and injured or
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
killed by a posi member the county would
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps be criminally liable for that
 
02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:48.870 align:start position:0%
perhaps be criminally liable for that
action

02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
as it's not unreasonable to assume that
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
a poorly trained individual who is armed
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
would not possess the necessary skills
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
and training to prevent an incident from
 
02:18:00.589 --> 02:18:00.599 align:start position:0%
escalating to a tragic point I agree
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
statement and I do believe that this is
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
a Pennsylvania based uh Sheriff's posi
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
because out in Pennsylvania they still
 
02:18:11.309 --> 02:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
do that in Western
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania RSA
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
106l which talks about police standards
 
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
and training Council and their Authority
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
and we as sheriffs are represented by by
 
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
Sheriff Conley right now as part of that
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council so
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
we have a voice on that Council it
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
discusses the certification process of
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers which my deputy
 
02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
sheriff's a full-time law enforcement
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
officers and some of them are part-time
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers and I have no
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
special deputies because I have no way
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
to pay them and everything according to
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
the law so uh so I have part-time Deputy
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
sheriffs RSA 106l describes what the
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
requirements are for us to have
 
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
certified police officers one of them is
 
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
a background check that takes time
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
normally it takes two weeks uh if not
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
longer depending on uh what their
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
background looks like we have to send
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
them to psychological evaluation to make
 
02:19:08.429 --> 02:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
sure that they're they're okay to be
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
police officers we have to do a medical
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
screening and we send them to a a
 
02:19:14.910 --> 02:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
physician to have a medical screening
 
02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
done so these are just a few of the
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
requirements not to mention the physical
 
02:19:21.549 --> 02:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
fitness section of it and all that and I
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
know that that bill I believe has come
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
before this committee at some point
 
02:19:26.750 --> 02:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
those are things that we look at for
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
certification process um the sheriffs in
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire at least nine
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
of us um out of the 10 positions are are
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
against this bill we're asking for it to
 
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
be ited as it relates to uh the way it's
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
written now I'll take any questions
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Sheriff
 
02:19:46.070 --> 02:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
um you you addressed the portion of the
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill about the posy type situation but
 
02:19:51.070 --> 02:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor indicated that he he
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
might be open to severing that with can
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
you address the part um with regard to
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
observing Federal officers enforcing um
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
their type of federal process
 
02:20:05.710 --> 02:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
what yes so uh observing Federal
 
02:20:08.590 --> 02:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
processes um again the federal laws are
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
set up and I I should not be required to
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
know what federal La is because I'm not
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
a Federal Officer I'm the sheriff of
 
02:20:15.469 --> 02:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
bnap County and I enforce New Hampshire
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
state law so I can't uh sit back and say
 
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
that I I can make a determination
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
whether they're violating a federal law
 
02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
or you know I can most certainly say
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
that state law uh as it relates to the
 
02:20:27.550 --> 02:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution and people's constitutional
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
rights um we can see certain direct
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
violations of constitutional rights and
 
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
we can most certainly um Express to not
 
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
do that uh one of the things that does
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
come into play though is uh certain
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that people
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
challenge uh it is not determined by a
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff it's determined by the courts in
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
our state and until it get gets before
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
the courts which would then require an
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
somebody to have an
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
offense made against them for them to
 
02:20:57.429 --> 02:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
put the process in place to get into the
 
02:20:58.990 --> 02:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
courts and then for the testimoni and
 
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that I would be called as a
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
witness and then we would go that
 
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
direction so I don't determine what
 
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights have been uh
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
violated per se as it relates to how
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
some people feel that they might have
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
been uh
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
suppressed as it relates to operations
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
in and around State uh and I could speak
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
specifically on my County uh every
 
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
Department every uh town and city in my
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
county has a police department those
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
police departments are no normally
 
02:21:30.750 --> 02:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
notified by federal agents that they're
 
02:21:32.910 --> 02:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to be doing a specific operation
 
02:21:34.110 --> 02:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
now if they're doing surveillance
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
operations we don't have time to to get
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
every time they come into town and and
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be doing surveillance
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that we have other
 
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
business that we're dealing with
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
especially in today's world where we're
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
having a hard time hiring Law
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers but they normally
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
do call us and say hey we're going to be
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
in the area or hey we're going to do
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
this certain operation uh in this
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
location and normally they call us for
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
some form of assistance whether it's
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
closing offroads or or being part of a
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh having a local connection to
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
whoever it is that they're dealing with
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
so there are normally conversations that
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
do occur now I can't speak for other
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
rural areas in the State uh that may not
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
have as many resources as I have in
 
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
belnap County but uh we're predominantly
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
notified when these events are happening
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
and traditionally uh if we're dealing
 
02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
with the DEA US Marshals ATF they
 
02:22:24.389 --> 02:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
normally include us to some degree
 
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
anyhow whether it needs to be in
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislation or not I don't know what
 
02:22:31.469 --> 02:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
mechanism we would use to to address an
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
issue if if there was legislation in
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
place that required them to notify me
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
and me to be participative member and
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
does that mean me as the sheriff has to
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
show up to all their events because I
 
02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to be up at 4:00 a.m. so when
 
02:22:44.670 --> 02:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing their hits at 4:00 a.m.
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
does that mean I have to be there or is
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
it one of my represent you you know
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative department members and
 
02:22:50.830 --> 02:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
then if we're there what are we doing
 
02:22:53.469 --> 02:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
and what if they didn't notify us am I
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to go down and arrest the US
 
02:22:57.309 --> 02:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
Marshall for not notifying us that they
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
were in the in the you know in the
 
02:23:01.469 --> 02:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
county of bellnap in the city of lonia
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
doing a certain event so I think there
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
just some complexities there and it's
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's an uncommon thing for us to
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
have these problems that are being
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
presented as potential problems that I
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing it as a problem and I
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
have not sat at the table with all the
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
sheriffs and we meet monthly for any of
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
them to complain about this as a matter
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
of fact most sheriffs have at least one
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
member associated with some form of a
 
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
federal government task
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
force and those members are generally um
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
also sworn so they have dual Powers is
 
02:23:34.510 --> 02:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
that is that true yes they go through a
 
02:23:35.950 --> 02:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
vetting process with the federal
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
government to to be to be basically uh
 
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
what they call special deputization
 
02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um questions for the
 
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
sheriff seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
sure thank you is there anyone else
 
02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify on this bill who has
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
not testified
 
02:23:55.469 --> 02:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
yet seeing none I hereby close the
 
02:23:57.269 --> 02:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
10117 and I open the public hearing on
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
HB 1026 relative to resisting arrest and
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
invite the prime sponsor to introduce
 
02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:15.990 align:start position:0%

02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
hello again Mr chair members of the
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
committee this bill conceptually was
 
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
brought to me by a constituent of mine
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
who was also a law enforcement
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
officer this constituent made me aware
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
according to his own testimony to me
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
that in at least some places he has seen
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
it as common practice to affect
 
02:24:57.269 --> 02:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
arrests that don't necessarily meet the
 
02:24:59.230 --> 02:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
legal threshold to make an
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
arrest and when the arreste vigorously
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
objects as one might have expect of
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
someone being arrested without proper
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
cause they would then lean on a charge
 
02:25:12.429 --> 02:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
of resisting arrest to justify the
 
02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
arrest in a post Hawk
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
fashion now
 
02:25:20.910 --> 02:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
I cannot independently verify whether
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
this is a thing that's happening whether
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's commonly happening or not I've been
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
told by this one officer that it does
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
happen however I can say just from a
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
simple reading of the law under
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
resisting arrest as it currently exists
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
it is set up specifically so that this
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
is something that can
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
happen so the question is should it be
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
happen now my analysis would say that
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
all of our laws under our constitution
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
can be reasonably said to flow from our
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
natural rights to self-defense and to
 
02:25:56.269 --> 02:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
self-determination the natural right to
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
self-defense is
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
unqualified it exists at all times
 
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
Against All
 
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
actors when one is the subject of
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
aggression that they did not provoke nor
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
initiate they have the right under law
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
under the
 
02:26:13.269 --> 02:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution to
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
self-defense All actors means private
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
government now I'm not going to suggest
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
for a moment that it's wise to resist
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
arrest I'm not going to suggest for a
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
moment that I would recommend anybody do
 
02:26:34.269 --> 02:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
it and I certainly would tend to
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
recommend that if somebody believes they
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
are being arrested without proper cause
 
02:26:42.950 --> 02:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
court

02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
however under current law they still can
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
be charged with resisting arrest even if
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
the arrest itself was found to be
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
unlawful or
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and that seems to me to
 
02:26:58.080 --> 02:26:59.630 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and that seems to me to
be

02:26:59.630 --> 02:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
unjust because they still possess that
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
right to self-defense no matter how wise
 
02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
it may or may not have been to enact at
 
02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:07.910 align:start position:0%
it may or may not have been to enact at
the

02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
time so this law would change that
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
statute to make it so there is an
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense to a resisting
 
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
arrest charge if the arrest itself is
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
determined to be in a civil or rather in
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
a court proceeding to have been
 
02:27:26.190 --> 02:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
unlawful and I believe that's how we
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
fixed this particular law that again was
 
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
brought to me by a constituent and law
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and I'm happy to
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you thank you
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
um you have me at okay so if if someone
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
makes an arrest and it turns out the
 
02:27:43.710 --> 02:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
arrest was no good if the person was
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
charged with the resisting arrest
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
depending on the level of that because
 
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire we don't have
 
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
an assault and battery and a police
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
officer statue resisting arrest can be
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere from you know this to punching
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
a police officer in the
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
face that's where we get kind of a
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
problem saying well you know it's that's
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's a separate thing and that can be
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay that I could see saying okay a
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
simple resisting arrest of um not
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
listening to the officer complying
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
versus physically assaulting an officer
 
02:28:15.790 --> 02:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
do do you see what I mean that the
 
02:28:17.790 --> 02:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
Nuance between those two things I do but
 
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
I think that can be reasonably resolved
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
through the normal circumstance that a
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
court undertakes to weigh the um the
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
reasonableness standard of self-defense
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
now again I wouldn't say that it's wise
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
to do so but if somebody in any
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
self-defense situation whether it's in
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
the street when they're being you know
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
being mugged or whatever the
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance if somebody comes up to
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
them and they they lay hands on them and
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
they push them and that person then
 
02:28:46.710 --> 02:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
takes out a knife and stabs them well
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
that's no longer self-defense because
 
02:28:49.790 --> 02:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
that You' you've now significantly
 
02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
exceeded that gradient of force so
 
02:28:54.110 --> 02:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing that would need
 
02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be adjudicated there um and I don't
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
mean to imply for a second that I like
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of a police officer being
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
assaulted um I would say though that
 
02:29:05.429 --> 02:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's still an injust situation because
 
02:29:06.910 --> 02:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
the person retains that right to
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
self-defense so if it's going on a
 
02:29:10.870 --> 02:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hands-On situation and they decide to
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
resist even though it may be
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
unwise I still would suggest they should
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
not be able to be charged with resisting
 
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
if the arrest was affected in an
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
unlawful for for without without
 
02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:23.870 align:start position:0%
unlawful for for without without
cause

02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:29:26.429 --> 02:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
okay see no further questions thank you
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.790 --> 02:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.110 --> 02:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
noon thank you for hearing my testimony
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
on this bill uh I support this bill um I
 
02:29:50.429 --> 02:29:50.439 align:start position:0%
was arrested uh 20 years ago for
 
02:29:50.439 --> 02:29:51.790 align:start position:0%
was arrested uh 20 years ago for
resisting

02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
resisting
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
arrest and uh There Was You Know
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
multiple Court hearings and you know a
 
02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of uh stuff that had happened and
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh the case was dismissed and
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
I filed a lawsuit and I was awarded a
 
02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
sum that I'm not allowed to talk about
 
02:30:09.070 --> 02:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
due to a
 
02:30:13.950 --> 02:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure anyways um the uh you
 
02:30:17.950 --> 02:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
know and in in my defense I to use uh
 
02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
actual you
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
know uh that the arrest was unlawful and
 
02:30:25.269 --> 02:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and hence when that
 
02:30:29.469 --> 02:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
evidence came to the court it was um you
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
know the case was eventually dismissed
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh this cost the taxpayers a lot of
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
money with the Judiciary and it also
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
cost him a lot of money with lawyers
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
defending uh a claim in federal court
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it cost a taxpayer's
 
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
money when uh was paid for my damages uh
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
something like this could um you know
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
alleviate a lot of that uh liability to
 
02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:55.950 align:start position:0%
alleviate a lot of that uh liability to
the

02:30:55.950 --> 02:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh I the property owners in
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pay a
 
02:31:06.750 --> 02:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
gross tax rate every year uh my property
 
02:31:10.269 --> 02:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
tax is like $10,000 a year and several
 
02:31:12.750 --> 02:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
of my neighbors are paying over $20,000
 
02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
a year for property taxes uh which is
 
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
just you know insane so we need to the
 
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to do things uh like
 
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh vote for this bill or allow this bill
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh to protect uh taxpayers from uh
 
02:31:33.630 --> 02:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
liability I don't know how much money
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire's Department of
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
risk and benefit um pays out in
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
settlements um you know with you know
 
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
these kind of cases but I know that that
 
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
number just in general what they pay out
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
is uh pretty excessive it's it's
 
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
actually a horrifying number I suggest
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh maybe you know some of you guys look
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
into that um and uh it is I I am uh on
 
02:31:59.790 --> 02:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
pretty good terms and good friends with
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh many current uh New Hampshire law
 
02:32:04.030 --> 02:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers uh as I've made it
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
a point to meet and talk with them
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
regularly uh at events and and places
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
where I see them and uh a lot of them
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
have uh commented to me that the uh you
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
know charging somebody with um resisting
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
arrest you know is just basically
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
something they use when they don't
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
really have anything else to use and at
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
least today with um you know things like
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh everybody's got a camera and there's
 
02:32:30.030 --> 02:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
cameras everywhere and in this
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
particular case where I was arrested 20
 
02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
years ago it was at a gas station and uh
 
02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
the the evidence was the surveillance
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
footage uh that you know what it took to
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
get it the Smith which was very hard to
 
02:32:45.429 --> 02:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
come up with actually um but anyways uh
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people law enforcement
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
who who who don't like how this can just
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
quite literally be used by someone in
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement who has an act to grind
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair recognizes Chief
 
02:33:07.240 --> 02:33:14.750 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair recognizes Chief
Charles

02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.150 --> 02:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
ratas good morning Mr chairman members
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Charles Raj I'm the
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
chief of the Hinsdale Police Department
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
um I do have over 20 years of police
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
experience I've worked in two different
 
02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
states four different counties five
 
02:33:30.429 --> 02:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
different municipalities including uh a
 
02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
23-year career in the military police
 
02:33:35.230 --> 02:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
Corps where I served all over the world
 
02:33:38.110 --> 02:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm no stranger to unfortunately
 
02:33:41.070 --> 02:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
encountering violent situations and uh
 
02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's the goal of law enforcement to
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
avoid violence and I think that uh
 
02:33:49.309 --> 02:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
especially the last four years there's
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
been a nationwide effort by police uh
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
Citizens Community members elected
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
officials at
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
deescalation at changing the way that uh
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
we approach violent situations and I
 
02:34:05.710 --> 02:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
personally have witnessed many
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
interactions with police officers that
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
have gone through extraordinary efforts
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
to avoid violent situations sometimes at
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
risk to themselves um I think that it's
 
02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
important that police officers have
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
legal protection so that if they are
 
02:34:24.990 --> 02:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
forced to be in injected into a
 
02:34:26.910 --> 02:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
situation where they have to take action
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
that they have that legal protection and
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
I think that a change to this statute
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
does exact opposite I think that it
 
02:34:36.110 --> 02:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
actually could encourage people who
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
believe that they are correct and that
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
the police are wrong to take action um
 
02:34:44.030 --> 02:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
frequently police encounter citizens at
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
their worst we encounter people in the
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
middle of Mental Health crisis we
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
encounter people that are impaired by
 
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
drugs and alcohol sometimes we encounter
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
people that are just outright upset um
 
02:34:57.070 --> 02:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
due to the circumstances that they're in
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
and all of those situations are when
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
people are not making the best decisions
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
for themselves in that moment and uh I
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
fear that uh if people believe that they
 
02:35:12.510 --> 02:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability to fight with the
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
police that they could outright just be
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
wrong and that all that that would do is
 
02:35:20.510 --> 02:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
just in create a situation where it goes
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
from nonviolent and compliance into a
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
situation where it could suddenly be
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
violent and uh frankly there's already
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
consequences for police for that and uh
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
that are non-violent police and we've
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
just heard testimony they face lawsuits
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh police face termination from their
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
job um and police even face jail time
 
02:35:43.070 --> 02:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's some serious consequences for
 
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
police officers we even now have a new
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the state level conduct Review
 
02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
Committee you can complain to your chief
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
of police to your Town Administrator you
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
can complain to sheriffs there there's a
 
02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
lot of avenues to uh to take out
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
grievances for a situation that isn't
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
right and uh personally I just believe
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
that adding more violence on top of uh
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
of a situation just isn't the right
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
answer thank you uh representative BRS
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman could you give us
 
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
an example of how many how many people
 
02:36:18.670 --> 02:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
while being arrested in your opinion
 
02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
actually are resisting and how many are
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
actually charged with
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
that it's just been my experience that
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's a large number of people who
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
are arrested there's uh a great majority
 
02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
of them are vocal and they're using
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
their uh their constitutional right to
 
02:36:37.950 --> 02:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
voice their displeasure with that and
 
02:36:40.269 --> 02:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
then most of them they go through the
 
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
process and if it turns out that they're
 
02:36:43.870 --> 02:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
innocent then that's what the court
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
process is there for and uh a very small
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
number um actually results in violence
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that that number's changed I
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
think that the numbers overall violent
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
situations have gone down over the last
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
20 years I think we're we're trending in
 
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the right direction and I think that
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
we want to continue
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
that Chief if you could the ideal
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
situation is uh you speak to a citizen
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
the citizen has committed a crime worthy
 
02:37:16.269 --> 02:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
of arrest you say to the citizen you're
 
02:37:17.950 --> 02:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
under arrest turn around put your hands
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
behind your back we're going to the
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
police station the citizen complies you
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
get in the car we go it goes to court
 
02:37:26.110 --> 02:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
court says officer you were wrong the
 
02:37:28.030 --> 02:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
citizen has a right to go to court sue
 
02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
the officer nobody got hurt in your
 
02:37:33.429 --> 02:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
opinion would this statute possibly
 
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
change that would it would does it make
 
02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
it legal for potentially someone who's
 
02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
been intoxicated who comes out of the
 
02:37:41.550 --> 02:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
bar at 1:00 in the morning same
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
situation you're under arrest you've
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
done AB orc put your hands behind your
 
02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
back with would they not be under this
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
statute allowed to make their own
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation if it's a legal arrest
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
and then physically
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
resist I reading this statute I believe
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
that it it gives the individual a great
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
amount of personal freedom to make that
 
02:38:03.710 --> 02:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
choice and um I I think that that's
 
02:38:06.670 --> 02:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous because uh police officers go
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
through a tremendous amount of training
 
02:38:10.269 --> 02:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
to make the decisions they make the
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
hiring process and the background the
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
polygraph the psychological examination
 
02:38:16.910 --> 02:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
takes about four months then there's a
 
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
4-month training period in the police
 
02:38:21.870 --> 02:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
academy then there's 4 months of field
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
training and then after that your
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
average police officer has to work in
 
02:38:27.269 --> 02:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
his jurisdiction for about a full year
 
02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
before they're trained just to get to
 
02:38:31.389 --> 02:38:31.399 align:start position:0%
that point to make that decision and I
 
02:38:34.990 --> 02:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that um given the general public
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to uh make the determination
 
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
on the spot to inflict violence on an
 
02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
officer if they believe the officer is
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
wrong I view that as highly dangerous
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and um there's a number of different I
 
02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
mean we could speculate a lot but
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's a number of different ways that
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
this could turn out it could turn out
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
that now they're going to get felony
 
02:38:56.190 --> 02:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
charges for an assault you know or in a
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
worst case scenario um a lot of people
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire carry firearms
 
02:39:01.710 --> 02:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
everywhere and it could be that it it
 
02:39:04.349 --> 02:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
turns into a gunfight and um I think
 
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
that the the risk factor there is
 
02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
extremely high thank
 
02:39:11.950 --> 02:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
you represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:39:15.309 --> 02:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
question so to Pigg you back off of the
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
vice chair's question how many people in
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
your opinion who are charged with
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.429 --> 02:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
arrest I think that there's a large
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
number who are and I think that usually
 
02:39:34.269 --> 02:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
in prosecution and um there might be
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
another expert behind me to testify a
 
02:39:38.590 --> 02:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
lot of times that's bargained away you
 
02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
know and I think it and I think it
 
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
depends it depends on the prosecutor it
 
02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
depends on the level of the offense it
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
depends a lot on what the underlying
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
charges too um so I mean I I don't have
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
any data set that I I could just give
 
02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
you that other than just my inherent
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
experience but usually um I think that
 
02:39:55.349 --> 02:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
the the prosecutors and the police are
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
out I'm all
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
good representative Stone thank you
 
02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
Chief thank you for taking my question
 
02:40:09.150 --> 02:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
in your opinion you would by removing
 
02:40:11.510 --> 02:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
the uh duty to submit to arrest in the
 
02:40:13.510 --> 02:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
state would that increase in your
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
opinion the injury level for officers
 
02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
and offenders absolutely for both the
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
goal is and I think that most police
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
officers do a fantastic job of putting
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
more time into a situation to end up
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
with a nonviolent result and I think
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
that if we inject the possibility for
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
violence I think that you're looking at
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
both sides both the citizen or even uh
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
Witnesses or just the public in general
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
and the police officer are all risking
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
injury thank you
 
02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.070 align:start position:0%
injury thank you
chief

02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.790 --> 02:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
Enders good afternoon my name is Step
 
02:41:11.309 --> 02:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
Anderson I'm an assistant County
 
02:41:12.670 --> 02:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
attorney of marac County I've been a
 
02:41:16.830 --> 02:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for uh over 20 years I do not
 
02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill I listening to the
 
02:41:23.070 --> 02:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor talk I think that there are two
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
things that he two premises that that I
 
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
disagree with the the first one being
 
02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
that you always have a right to
 
02:41:32.429 --> 02:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
self-defense um I don't know that I I
 
02:41:34.510 --> 02:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
agree with that premise that you always
 
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
have a right to self-defense and I know
 
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
at one point I talked about part one
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
article three of the New Hampshire
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution where there's a recognition
 
02:41:44.349 --> 02:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
that when you enter into society you
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
give up some of your natural rights um
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
in order to benefit that society and
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly that makes sense to me again
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the sense that if you're living in a
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
society we can't have sort of vigilante
 
02:42:01.870 --> 02:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
justice that coexists with an organized
 
02:42:04.670 --> 02:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
Society so you take your problems to
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
society um and they're resolved in the
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
ways that that the law sort of
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
instructs um the the second premise was
 
02:42:18.190 --> 02:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
he said something about the police being
 
02:42:20.790 --> 02:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
able to use resisting arrest as a way of
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
of taking people into custody and
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
further searching them or that type of
 
02:42:26.750 --> 02:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
thing I don't think that's the case
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
either normally when the police uh
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
lawfully arrest an individual they can
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
search that person incident to to
 
02:42:37.389 --> 02:42:37.399 align:start position:0%
arrest there's there is a case in New
 
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State versus
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
Baine that can be found at 151 New
 
02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 803 it's a 2005
 
02:42:52.349 --> 02:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
case um where Mr Bain ran from the
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
police the police chased after him they
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
thought he was selling drugs um chased
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
after him and eventually stopped him and
 
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
charged him with resisting arrest from
 
02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
running from the police when they
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
searched him incident to arrest they
 
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
found that no surprise he had a large
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
amount of drugs in his pockets um the
 
02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court said that
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
that was an unlawful arrest because they
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have reasonable suspicion at the
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
time they started chasing him to believe
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
he was selling drugs and we charged him
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
with resisting arrest and with
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
possession of a controlled drug with
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
intent to sell and the drugs were all
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
suppressed because the Supreme Court
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
said yeah normally you can do a search
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
incident to arrest but that doesn't
 
02:43:37.230 --> 02:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
always mean you can and in a resisting
 
02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
arrest case with an unlawful arrest you
 
02:43:41.790 --> 02:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
specifically cannot do a search incident
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
to arrest um I I know that because I was
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor here in that case
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
but there is another
 
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
case well there's another statute that I
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
would draw your attention to which is
 
02:43:57.279 --> 02:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
would draw your attention to which is
RSA

02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:44:01.469 --> 02:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
5945 that talks about resisting arrest
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's under the arrest
 
02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
section it says if a person is
 
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable ground to believe that he is
 
02:44:09.389 --> 02:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
being arrested and that the arrest is
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
being made by a peace officer it is his
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
duty to submit to arrest and refrain
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
from using force or any weapon in
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
resisting it regardless of whether
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's a legal basis for the arrest
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
that was passed by the legislature in
 
02:44:25.309 --> 02:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
1941 and has remained unamended since
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
then um to the extent you do change the
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
resisting arrest statute I would
 
02:44:33.389 --> 02:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
encourage you to take a look at 5945 as
 
02:44:35.710 --> 02:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
well and make sure that whatever change
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
you make which again I would discourage
 
02:44:40.110 --> 02:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
harmonizes with that
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute there is another case that that
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
talks about this state versus h
 
02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:47.269 align:start position:0%
talks about this state versus h
it's

02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:44:47.279 --> 02:44:48.830 align:start position:0%
it's
Haas

02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
Haas
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
um that can be found at 134 New
 
02:44:58.030 --> 02:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 480 it's a 1991 case where the
 
02:44:59.870 --> 02:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court actually talks a lot about
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
your right to resist arrest for an
 
02:45:04.269 --> 02:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
unlawful arrest and they talk about how
 
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
that used to be um under common law that
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
arrest and there's a quote in that case
 
02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to read to you it says a
 
02:45:18.349 --> 02:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
society which seemingly becomes more
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
complex with each passing day is
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
enlightened when its laws reflect the
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
high purpose to have apparent
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
differences between those who wield the
 
02:45:28.030 --> 02:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
authority of government and those who do
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
not resolved in the courts or by some
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
other orderly process rather than by
 
02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
physical confrontation on the street or
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:45:38.349 --> 02:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
gutter and I think that's really what
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
this comes down to is we don't want
 
02:45:42.349 --> 02:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
people fighting on the street with
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
police trying to figure out if their
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
arrest was legal or not submit to the
 
02:45:51.230 --> 02:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
arrest then it's up to the court and if
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
you were unlawfully arrested you should
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
sue the police and if the police
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
unlawfully arrested you you should
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
receive some damages for that um so I
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
would oppose the bill I'm happy to
 
02:46:09.790 --> 02:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
usual see no questions thank you thank
 
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.110 align:start position:0%
usual see no questions thank you thank
you

02:46:16.110 --> 02:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:46:27.870 --> 02:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
narby this will be brief so uh there was
 
02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:32.150 align:start position:0%
narby this will be brief so uh there was
an

02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:46:36.510 --> 02:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
instant there's a a wide uh discrepancy
 
02:46:37.950 --> 02:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
in how things are written and how they
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
actually happen in
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
reality uh this is one of them with
 
02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
regards to resisting arrest there is a
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
group called The Noble 9 uh they were at
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's council meeting uh that
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
was uh engaged in discussing and
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
rejecting federal covid funds they were
 
02:46:57.309 --> 02:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
all charged by the state police with
 
02:46:57.319 --> 02:46:58.510 align:start position:0%
all charged by the state police with
resisting

02:46:58.510 --> 02:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
resisting
 
02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
arrest there's video that exists in fact
 
02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
there was a documentary made of them and
 
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
if you watch it you'll see none of them
 
02:47:11.230 --> 02:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
resisted arrest yet they were all
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
charged so this is
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.429 align:start position:0%
charged so this is
what

02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:47:16.990 --> 02:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
this is what giving discretion opens the
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
door to and again there must be very
 
02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
clearly defined lines otherwise
 
02:47:23.309 --> 02:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
unaccountable people will take advantage
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:31.469 --> 02:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
Stone chair recognizes um bill brigh
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
Police

02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
morning chairman Roy and uh members of
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
the committee I appreciate you hearing
 
02:47:53.309 --> 02:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
my testimony this morning my name is
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
Bill brigh I'm with the New Hampshire
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
State Police uh I'm a major I currently
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
oversee the detective uh all detectives
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
with the state police uh Chief rage and
 
02:48:06.150 --> 02:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
attorney Henderson did a good job uh
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
with many of the points that I would
 
02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
have brought up to the committee um the
 
02:48:13.630 --> 02:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
only thing I would add is that I just
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
that the committee recognizes is that
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
the threshold for a police officer to
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
detain somebody is reasonable suspicion
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
in in other words if a police officer
 
02:48:26.150 --> 02:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
has Reasonable Suspicion uh to believe
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
that a crime is being committed or has
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
been committed they have a right to
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
detain somebody to further question and
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
and investigate um the uh language of
 
02:48:39.269 --> 02:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
the statute is actually resisting arrest
 
02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
or detention so it's not always in in
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
while a police officer is affecting an
 
02:48:44.479 --> 02:48:45.510 align:start position:0%
while a police officer is affecting an
arrest

02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
02:48:48.750 --> 02:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
um where this can be charged so I would
 
02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
just point out the uh those little
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
factors that um it's it's always the
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
right thing to do to comply with the
 
02:48:58.269 --> 02:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
police while they figure out a situation
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
we feel that uh adding this language to
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
the statute and changing the statute the
 
02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
way it is now will put police officers
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
troopers at risk uh more of a risk for
 
02:49:10.990 --> 02:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh physical harm than they have at the
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
moment and it would encourage uh people
 
02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
to resist arrest rather than just comply
 
02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
with with what's going on at the time
 
02:49:20.030 --> 02:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
and as the chief pointed out and
 
02:49:22.590 --> 02:49:22.600 align:start position:0%
attorney Henderson and as uh the
 
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee has recognized there are
 
02:49:28.510 --> 02:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
Avenues in place already to uh Rectify
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
those situations where a person is
 
02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
wronged in in that
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%

seeking to clarify and close the gap
 
03:01:36.510 --> 03:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
between uh federal and state
 
03:01:39.429 --> 03:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
legislation uh this bill defines and
 
03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
prohibits within New Hampshire specific
 
03:01:44.910 --> 03:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of medical help and other
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
situations of torture similar to how it
 
03:01:50.750 --> 03:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
is defined and prohibited by the federal
 
03:01:54.030 --> 03:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
law concerning officials actions outside
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
of the uh U us uh let us see the federal
 
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
um uh us code uh 18 chapter uh 113 C Tor
 
03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
and specifically section 2340 capital a
 
03:02:15.710 --> 03:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
torture uh uh section A says starts with
 
03:02:18.429 --> 03:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
whoever outside the United States
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
commits or attempts to commit torture
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
shall be find under this title or in
 
03:02:26.590 --> 03:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
present and so on uh that is the scope
 
03:02:30.190 --> 03:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
of the federal uh prohibition of torture
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
VI this chapters only for acts outside
 
03:02:36.990 --> 03:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh the United States uh this bill was
 
03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
brought up to me as a constituent
 
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
request uh and you will hear additional
 
03:02:46.349 --> 03:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
testimonial later uh in initially I was
 
03:02:48.070 --> 03:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to refer it to another
 
03:02:50.830 --> 03:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
representative but uh the more I thought
 
03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
about this situation the more sense it
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
made to fix it uh one objection uh to
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation um that we hear is that
 
03:03:04.429 --> 03:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
this specific prohibition of torture is
 
03:03:06.990 --> 03:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
not needed this should be already
 
03:03:10.110 --> 03:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
covered by broader statues uh
 
03:03:12.309 --> 03:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when the system stops
 
03:03:14.429 --> 03:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
working as it's supposed to any
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
ambiguity or lack of clarity can be
 
03:03:19.150 --> 03:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
abused to receive
 
03:03:22.190 --> 03:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
immunity uh we are not claiming that
 
03:03:25.229 --> 03:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
torture is happening in New Hampshire we
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
just want a clear framework for the
 
03:03:30.910 --> 03:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
future generation uh personally I'm a
 
03:03:33.429 --> 03:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
big believer in the US and in New
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but many experts including
 
03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
those in mass media um are less
 
03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
optimistic they say the risk of danger
 
03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
populism is on the rise the risk of
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
fascism is on the rise the risk of
 
03:03:53.910 --> 03:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
authoritarianism is on the rise in the
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
US the experts say the US can elect
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
somebody like
 
03:04:01.389 --> 03:04:01.399 align:start position:0%
Putin I personally do not say the risk
 
03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
is so close but since I'm an immigrant
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
from Eastern Europe and follow Russian
 
03:04:11.030 --> 03:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
politics let me tell you about Putin yes
 
03:04:14.590 --> 03:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh he's torturing people yes uh he is
 
03:04:18.150 --> 03:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
poisoning his political opponents yes uh
 
03:04:21.950 --> 03:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
he is withdrawing their medical help
 
03:04:24.190 --> 03:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
whether you believe that something like
 
03:04:26.190 --> 03:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
that can happen after the next
 
03:04:28.830 --> 03:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
presidential election or in a distant
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
future let's make this small effort to
 
03:04:35.550 --> 03:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
stop the worst from happening uh US
 
03:04:38.269 --> 03:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
senator from New Hampshire Jin
 
03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
shahin supported Mikel sakash as he was
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
tortured in prison
 
03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
she did so within a bipartisan group of
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%

to challenge Russian President Vladimir

Putin including during the war of
 
03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
2008 but once Putin was able to exert
 
03:05:10.550 --> 03:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient control over that government
 
03:05:13.790 --> 03:05:13.800 align:start position:0%

brink of dying to save your time I will
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
stop here but I'm ready to answer any
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
question please support House Bill 172
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
let us ensure New Hampshire stays
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
torture free thank
 
03:05:40.510 --> 03:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative any
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:53.790 --> 03:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
M taking a look at our um at our uh
 
03:05:56.429 --> 03:05:56.439 align:start position:0%
assault statutes a lot of the things
 
03:05:59.790 --> 03:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
that you would uh that would constitute
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
torture um are actually already illegal
 
03:06:07.710 --> 03:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
uh under assault laws um so I I guess my
 
03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
question for you is why do you think
 
03:06:15.389 --> 03:06:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:18.030 --> 03:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for a question uh I would
 
03:06:20.590 --> 03:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
generally agree that there's a
 
03:06:20.600 --> 03:06:22.309 align:start position:0%
generally agree that there's a
significant

03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
similarity um but there was a a reason
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
why uh Federal statue for torure exist
 
03:06:33.950 --> 03:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes uh torure does not
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh leave
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh certain um injuries be observable
 
03:06:45.870 --> 03:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
injuries behind it um and um uh there
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
are uh I believe need for clarity uh in
 
03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
definitions so uh I I do believe uh
 
03:06:57.630 --> 03:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
despite the similarity uh the Tor need
 
03:07:00.910 --> 03:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
to be outlined
 
03:07:03.229 --> 03:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
separately representative is there other
 
03:07:06.190 --> 03:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of torture other than involving
 
03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:08.710 align:start position:0%
kinds of torture other than involving
physical

03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
assault that you can think
 
03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:14.389 align:start position:0%
assault that you can think
of

03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:07:20.590 --> 03:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of uh this bill uh um if
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
you see section two uh um and uh
 
03:07:31.229 --> 03:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
specifically section B uh numer three
 
03:07:34.750 --> 03:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
there also lists the withholding
 
03:07:36.910 --> 03:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
authoring withholding of medical
 
03:07:39.429 --> 03:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
treatment or lawful medications
 
03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
calculated to inflict severe medical
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
pain or suffering so it's not
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
specifically assault but uh it's uh what
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
I believe a reasonable person would
 
03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:51.309 align:start position:0%
I believe a reasonable person would
consider

03:07:51.309 --> 03:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
torture thank you rep representative did
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up representative
 
03:07:59.710 --> 03:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
M do you have a followup or no I'm thank
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
you represent Stone thank you thank you
 
03:08:03.389 --> 03:08:03.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question prior to doing
 
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation have you looked at the
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 6314 631 and the other
 
03:08:07.800 --> 03:08:10.870 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 6314 631 and the other
assault

03:08:10.870 --> 03:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
statutes uh briefly
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
could you clarify your question yeah my
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
question is is that most of the
 
03:08:20.710 --> 03:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
languages uh as representative Muse said
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
very duplicative on the elements of each
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
one whether it be the criminal
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
threatening statute the assault statutes
 
03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
they they're basically already covered
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
so basically this bill would just be the
 
03:08:34.670 --> 03:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
same as these other statutes that break
 
03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
it down in various sections that's
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
rsas

03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
in in just in the interest of um time I
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
I believe the witness testified though
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
that there is certain aspects that are
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
not covered in the statutes for example
 
03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
withholding of Medical Care um that
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
might be under a different statute just
 
03:08:59.070 --> 03:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
quick followup is that uh you your
 
03:09:02.229 --> 03:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
penalties are various which would be in
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
conflict between a class a felony and
 
03:09:06.990 --> 03:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor class a felony class
 
03:09:11.229 --> 03:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.590 --> 03:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
statutes thank you for question and
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh um yeah as I said I I believe it's
 
03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
still needed that way if there's a but
 
03:09:24.510 --> 03:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
if there's any conflict uh as you said
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
between classes of felonies uh I hope to
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
rectified uh it will be rectified with u
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment or something like
 
03:09:35.550 --> 03:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
03:09:38.229 --> 03:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh see no further
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your
 
03:09:51.870 --> 03:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:54.510 --> 03:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
noon thank you again I'll make this uh
 
03:09:57.389 --> 03:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
very brief um you know the purpose of uh
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
government as described in the
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the uh declaration is
 
03:10:03.710 --> 03:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
to secure and protect the rights uh life
 
03:10:07.229 --> 03:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
liberty property Pursuit of Happiness uh
 
03:10:10.870 --> 03:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would uh be securing uh you
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
know the pursuit of happiness and and
 
03:10:15.469 --> 03:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
rights of people by outlawing or Banning
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
or making a prose Prosecuting people
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
that commit torture obviously someone
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
who was tortured is being deprived of
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
Lights rights this government is uh
 
03:10:26.590 --> 03:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
created to secure and protect therefore
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:38.349 --> 03:10:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you Mr chair and uh
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I want to make
 
03:10:45.070 --> 03:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
a single quick quick Point uh the
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
federal prohibition on torture only
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
applies outside of the United States um
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
and you can read it for yourself whoever
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
outside the United
 
03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
States commits or attempts to commit
 
03:10:57.429 --> 03:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
torture shall be fined under this title
 
03:11:00.349 --> 03:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
or imprisoned etc etc uh the kit point
 
03:11:03.429 --> 03:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
being that it there is a federal ban on
 
03:11:05.349 --> 03:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
on torture but only outside of the
 
03:11:10.349 --> 03:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.550 --> 03:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:22.110 --> 03:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
here hi good morning um my name is
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
Michael Peltier I am from uh now from uh
 
03:11:31.190 --> 03:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro um uh prior to that from uh
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
hookset um so I wanted to um address uh
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Stones Point um the
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
assault and related
 
03:11:44.110 --> 03:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
offenses um
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
they would apply to acts of torture but
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
you can view this as a a sentence
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
enhancement for example so like uh
 
03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
violence against Elders might have a be
 
03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
considered a more serious crime than you
 
03:12:01.030 --> 03:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
know a simple assault you know barall
 
03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
for example um and I think that uh
 
03:12:07.790 --> 03:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
police officials and people who are in
 
03:12:11.790 --> 03:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
control of other people uh should have
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh more serious consequences for
 
03:12:15.630 --> 03:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
committing acts of torture is defined in
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
the statute um now with respect to
 
03:12:23.550 --> 03:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
um the the Bill's definition of torture
 
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
it very closely mirrors the uh in some
 
03:12:29.070 --> 03:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
cases literally mirrors the definition
 
03:12:31.790 --> 03:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
of torture in the federal statute uh so
 
03:12:33.910 --> 03:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's in you know in alignment in
 
03:12:38.750 --> 03:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
that regard um it does add the um with
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
denial of uh Healthcare and lawful medic
 
03:12:45.150 --> 03:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
medications to the definition of torture
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh this is something that um it seems
 
03:12:49.950 --> 03:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
like some of the re you know regimes
 
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
around the world uh such as Iran or
 
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
Russia under Putin um have worked out as
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
an exemption to as an exception to a way
 
03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
for them to inflict severe U mental or
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
physical suffering on somebody without
 
03:13:09.190 --> 03:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh falling under the the Treaty
 
03:13:13.349 --> 03:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
definition of torture um now uh with
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
respect to recourse uh that someone may
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
have um
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
the uh oh well I should also mention
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the world Medical Association uh is
 
03:13:27.870 --> 03:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
has decried uh the deliberate denial of
 
03:13:30.990 --> 03:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care uh in Iranian prisons as
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
amounting to torture now um in
 
03:13:37.389 --> 03:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
1976 uh the Supreme
 
03:13:40.790 --> 03:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
Court said in uh a case called stelle
 
03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
versus Gamble that a prison staff's
 
03:13:45.790 --> 03:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
deliberate indifference to the serious
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
medical needs of prisoners amounts to
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
cruel and unusual punishment under the
 
03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
cruel and unusual punishment under the
eth

03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
eth
 
03:13:54.910 --> 03:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
amendment um and also uh the United
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
Nations standard minimum rules for the
 
03:13:59.110 --> 03:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
treatment of prisoner denying necessary
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
Medical Care uh violates that as well
 
03:14:02.279 --> 03:14:04.830 align:start position:0%
Medical Care uh violates that as well
and

03:14:04.830 --> 03:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:14:09.269 --> 03:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
um so there are a couple of recourses
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
that folks have in the United States
 
03:14:13.630 --> 03:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
under federal law uh to address acts of
 
03:14:16.870 --> 03:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
torture uh one is a civil rights lawsuit
 
03:14:18.910 --> 03:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh which does not always hold the
 
03:14:18.920 --> 03:14:20.110 align:start position:0%
uh which does not always hold the
individual

03:14:20.110 --> 03:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:14:22.750 --> 03:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
responsible uh for the ACT personally
 
03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
accountable and arguably that person
 
03:14:27.830 --> 03:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
should absolutely be held personally
 
03:14:31.710 --> 03:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
accountable um another um as another
 
03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
Avenue is in the on the criminal side is
 
03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
um 18 USC 242 which is deprivation of
 
03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
civil rights under color of law um
 
03:14:43.469 --> 03:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
absent any bodily injury
 
03:14:46.990 --> 03:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh or various other aggravating factors
 
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's only a federal misdemeanor uh that
 
03:14:51.950 --> 03:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
has B basically up to a year prison
 
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
sentence uh and it's only a 10-year
 
03:14:58.229 --> 03:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
felony even if botle injury results um
 
03:14:59.910 --> 03:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I would I would submit that
 
03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
and you know I would I would submit that
that

03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:05.469 --> 03:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
um that the crime of assault committed
 
03:15:07.389 --> 03:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
by a police officer against a prisoner
 
03:15:09.870 --> 03:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
in their custody
 
03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
um punishing that as say a simple
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
assault or an aggravated assault under
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh under the law with those lower
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
penalties uh violates uh the spirit of
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
article 18 of the New Hampshire
 
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution calling for punishments to
 
03:15:29.229 --> 03:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
be proportional to the crimes um and
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
torture is absolutely a serious crime
 
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
everyone recognizes that around the
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
world and uh I think this bill gives us
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh as representative
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
poov uh said close that gap between uh
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh that exists in in federal
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
law now H happy to take any questions um
 
03:15:55.150 --> 03:15:55.160 align:start position:0%

orrect correct yeah the definition of
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
torture uh presumes that it's a somebody
 
03:16:19.630 --> 03:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
acting in official capacity under color
 
03:16:23.150 --> 03:16:23.160 align:start position:0%

8 I'm introducing House Bill
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
1330 that has to do with uh the
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
discipline system in the EMS
 
03:17:47.520 --> 03:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
discipline system in the EMS
bureau

03:17:49.510 --> 03:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
03:17:52.269 --> 03:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh and the way I got involved with this
 
03:17:55.150 --> 03:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
is I've been two people that I know
 
03:17:58.670 --> 03:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
quite well have been in this s put into
 
03:17:58.680 --> 03:17:59.469 align:start position:0%
quite well have been in this s put into
this

03:17:59.469 --> 03:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
system that at the time wasn't working
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
very well at
 
03:18:08.590 --> 03:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
all the first case I'll tell you about
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
is she was my ex-wife she was a
 
03:18:11.279 --> 03:18:12.630 align:start position:0%
is she was my ex-wife she was a
paramedic

03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
paramedic
 
03:18:13.950 --> 03:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
and did
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
a a documentation
 
03:18:20.910 --> 03:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
era and she asked me to go with her when
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
she was being interviewed about what
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
happened she is at a paramedic level and
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
an EMT was the person who was like the
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
um investigator or the officer
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
collecting the facts and was going to
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
make a decision or recommend a decision
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
who was two levels down from her has no
 
03:18:46.389 --> 03:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
idea of what was going
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
on uh she got
 
03:18:52.590 --> 03:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
disciplined what I thought was a very
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
long time for a clerical Adder where
 
03:18:57.110 --> 03:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
most people just get hey don't do that
 
03:18:58.469 --> 03:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
again pay
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
attention um and what happens on their
 
03:19:06.349 --> 03:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
website there's a a list that pops up of
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
everybody that's been disciplined
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:18.510 --> 03:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
there my ex-wife passed away I said hey
 
03:19:20.070 --> 03:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
can you take that down that would be
 
03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
really nice nope there's no provision in
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the law so in in section five
 
03:19:29.189 --> 03:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
um that is there to give them the
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity a after five years it comes
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
off that visible list but stays in their
 
03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
record and when you die it comes off
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
because because they're obviously not
 
03:19:45.469 --> 03:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
coming back to get
 
03:19:49.710 --> 03:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
hired so the other case I have is of a
 
03:19:52.510 --> 03:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
person very
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh televised
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
case happened in
 
03:20:03.469 --> 03:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester she waited 11 months to get a
 
03:20:05.469 --> 03:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
determination of whether she was going
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
to be okay suspended or license
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
revoked she has family that she has to
 
03:20:18.790 --> 03:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
care for and every day she did not know
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
would this be the day that I have to
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
give up my career because they finally
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
decided so after 11 months the state
 
03:20:30.510 --> 03:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
finally said nope you absolutely did
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong you're good to go but that
 
03:20:34.750 --> 03:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
was a long
 
03:20:39.550 --> 03:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
time and finding out that really one
 
03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
person gets to make that decision which
 
03:20:44.229 --> 03:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
is the commission commer who isn't an
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
add I thought there should be at least
 
03:20:54.189 --> 03:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
three people looking at if you're going
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be suspended or revoked shouldn't be
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
just one person should be three me three
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
peers looking at this I had it that they
 
03:21:06.990 --> 03:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
were going to have the deciding vote in
 
03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
my original
 
03:21:09.279 --> 03:21:10.830 align:start position:0%
my original
bill

03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:12.990 align:start position:0%
bill
but

03:21:12.990 --> 03:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:15.670 --> 03:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
after talking to the director telling me
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
that he has a lot of things in place now
 
03:21:20.670 --> 03:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
and that maybe it should be just that
 
03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
they consult with the commissioner and
 
03:21:25.030 --> 03:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner still makes the final
 
03:21:27.950 --> 03:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
decision so that's what the amendment is
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
about it it just makes it an advisory
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
committee instead of the prior approval
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
it just removes the prior approval out
 
03:21:38.349 --> 03:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill and down in section five it
 
03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
removes public records to public list
 
03:21:44.870 --> 03:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.389 --> 03:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
website I have reservations about
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment
 
03:21:52.189 --> 03:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
forth but I told him I would give it a
 
03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
go and see how it how it
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
goes uh and I understand the director
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
has done a great job he's made a lot of
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
changes but like I told him you're not
 
03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
going to be here forever so the system
 
03:22:09.030 --> 03:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
has to be able to move on when you're
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
gone and not revert back to what it was
 
03:22:15.150 --> 03:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
cuz we were eating our own for a long
 
03:22:18.550 --> 03:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
time down at the Bureau of EMS and I
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to see that go back to that
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
way so I'll conclude my
 
03:22:24.800 --> 03:22:28.189 align:start position:0%
way so I'll conclude my
testimony

03:22:28.189 --> 03:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
um and I'll take any
 
03:22:33.150 --> 03:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
questions do um to the best of your
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge other medical professions how
 
03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
are their licenses handled to is it just
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
one person who gets to decide it's
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
usually a board it's a board yeah and
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
know like through
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
oplc uh they have boards that hear that
 
03:22:49.710 --> 03:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
there might be one person that's
 
03:22:51.870 --> 03:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
Gathering facts but the facts are then
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
presented to the board you have the
 
03:22:57.189 --> 03:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
ability to testify in front of the board
 
03:22:58.790 --> 03:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
after they've gotten the
 
03:23:01.990 --> 03:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
facts and that kind of thing and your
 
03:23:04.349 --> 03:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment it it still leaves it in the
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
hands of the one person it just mandates
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
they consult with three people so they
 
03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
you're right they're going to set up a
 
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
board that has three people of their
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
peer same level or
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
higher uh to hear that information make
 
03:23:19.359 --> 03:23:20.229 align:start position:0%
higher uh to hear that information make
a

03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
decision because right now they have one
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
person taking in the facts it goes to
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
the director of The Bureau and then he
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
recommends to the commissioner and the
 
03:23:31.870 --> 03:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the final
 
03:23:36.309 --> 03:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
say I still have a little hurn with that
 
03:23:38.710 --> 03:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
but we haven't accepted the amendment
 
03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
yet representative s thank you and thank
 
03:23:44.830 --> 03:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um reading
 
03:23:46.269 --> 03:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
through your bill and through the
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
amendment as well um I don't see
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
something and maybe I'm missing it that
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
would address the 11mon delay in getting
 
03:23:57.070 --> 03:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
a response and I wondered whether it
 
03:23:59.189 --> 03:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
might serve to have some sort of
 
03:24:02.349 --> 03:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
timeline added that says within no more
 
03:24:04.269 --> 03:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
than 90 days barring exceptional
 
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances for example oh I'd be
 
03:24:08.830 --> 03:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
happy to add that um just to ensure that
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
that the timelines are more streamlined
 
03:24:13.630 --> 03:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
um in terms of that process and then Mas
 
03:24:17.030 --> 03:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
a followup thank you um I wonder about
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
um perhaps for the next legislative
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
session developing something that
 
03:24:22.630 --> 03:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
requires qualifications for the
 
03:24:25.309 --> 03:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner um so that they do in fact
 
03:24:28.630 --> 03:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
have some medical skill or EMT level
 
03:24:31.630 --> 03:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
skill to be uh more appropriate to make
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
those determinations I think you might
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
find that hard because the commissioner
 
03:24:38.910 --> 03:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
is for the Department of Safety so
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's police Fire EMS so trying to get
 
03:24:45.870 --> 03:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
one person that has all three of those
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
skills will probably be
 
03:24:48.359 --> 03:24:50.389 align:start position:0%
skills will probably be
impossible

03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
03:24:53.349 --> 03:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
but well he has one he has police yeah
 
03:24:56.070 --> 03:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
right okay um any further
 
03:24:59.070 --> 03:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
questions repr
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
Muse I would have been disappointed if
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't ask me a
 
03:25:06.429 --> 03:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
question no no hopefully it's an easy
 
03:25:08.910 --> 03:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
one um how often do things like this
 
03:25:10.590 --> 03:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
come up is is this something that comes
 
03:25:14.950 --> 03:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
up like a dozen times a year or
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
uh a few times a year I would say um and
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh I can't forget I can't remember the
 
03:25:28.710 --> 03:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
term because it's gone right out of my
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
head it's like a a letter
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
of um warning or something like that so
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require any of this and
 
03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
they're using that a lot more I guess uh
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
this director developed that
 
03:25:45.070 --> 03:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
as a way to say hey don't do that again
 
03:25:48.510 --> 03:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
right and so I understand that's being
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
used more but the higher levels
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
ones we don't make that many
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
mistakes right but the few that happen
 
03:26:01.630 --> 03:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
and some of them are are
 
03:26:05.189 --> 03:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
just a documentation area I I know like
 
03:26:08.070 --> 03:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
in my ex-wife they changed the front
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
line first line
 
03:26:12.830 --> 03:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
drug and she was always is used to using
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
what was the second line drug she
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
actually used the first line drug but in
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
her head she wrote the second line drug
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
right turned in the the proper bottle to
 
03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
get refilled but because she wrote the
 
03:26:29.229 --> 03:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
minds representative cite letter of
 
03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
concern letter of what letter of concern
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
I think yes that's it thank
 
03:26:43.030 --> 03:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%

Phillips good afternoon Mr chair and
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%

for the opportunity to speak my name is
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey Phillips I'm representing the
 
03:27:01.790 --> 03:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety um and I'm the
 
03:27:03.070 --> 03:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the division of
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
fire standards and training and
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services um my
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
comments will be u based on the original
 
03:27:12.429 --> 03:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
bill um representative appr did U
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
provide us with an amendment so we'll
 
03:27:15.870 --> 03:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
review that and provide feedback back to
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
the committee um as the original bill is
 
03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
written the department of safety opposes
 
03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bill for many reasons um we'd have
 
03:27:25.389 --> 03:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
had conversations with representative PR
 
03:27:29.349 --> 03:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
to share our concerns which um I believe
 
03:27:31.990 --> 03:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh he attempted to put into the
 
03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so we appreciate his um
 
03:27:36.990 --> 03:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
communication on that so currently right
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
now the department of safety has ability
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
to immediately suspend EMS license uh
 
03:27:45.229 --> 03:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
EMS providers uh their right to practice
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
if it is determined that the EMS
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
provider causes an imminent uh threat to
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
Public Safety um or public health with
 
03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the original bill that's currently there
 
03:28:00.670 --> 03:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
um it adds a layer to the to have this
 
03:28:03.389 --> 03:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
go towards the panel which would delay
 
03:28:06.269 --> 03:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
the suspension of uh a provider's
 
03:28:09.269 --> 03:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
license which could immediately um allow
 
03:28:11.429 --> 03:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
this person to continue to practice and
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
jeopardize uh Public Safety or the
 
03:28:15.670 --> 03:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
welfare of individuals that are calling
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
for assistance secondly the original
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
original ordering of the bill requires
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
this board to review all uh renewals of
 
03:28:27.229 --> 03:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
licenses which I believe was an
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of the original
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill um this would delay the licensing
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
of uh 5,500 licensed providers that
 
03:28:39.790 --> 03:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
don't have any disciplinary action um so
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was the original int
 
03:28:42.670 --> 03:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
ENT of the bill but based off the
 
03:28:45.870 --> 03:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
wording that was our interpretation of
 
03:28:49.229 --> 03:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
it uh the bill also authorizes as
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative PR talked about the
 
03:28:53.590 --> 03:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
removal of lenses from the public uh
 
03:28:56.110 --> 03:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
from our public records um the original
 
03:28:58.189 --> 03:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
I think the the amendment did cover this
 
03:28:59.790 --> 03:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
it changed it from public records to
 
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
public list um the public list that's
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
posted um we opposed to having those
 
03:29:07.469 --> 03:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
individual lenses records removed
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
entirely from our
 
03:29:12.750 --> 03:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
system additionally RSA 5313 authorizes
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner to deny an application
 
03:29:17.150 --> 03:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
for issuance or renewal or to take
 
03:29:19.030 --> 03:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
action on license if the individual is
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
found guilty of violating
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
153 um the bill would require
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
pre-approval from the panel um as
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative PR did uh his Amendment
 
03:29:31.550 --> 03:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
does change this to an ad essentially
 
03:29:34.269 --> 03:29:34.279 align:start position:0%
consult uh with the board prior to the
 
03:29:37.389 --> 03:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
commission making decision um by having
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
it a pre-approval this could create a
 
03:29:41.590 --> 03:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
situation where there's a stal M and
 
03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
there's nobody that has the final
 
03:29:46.590 --> 03:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
authorization so if the commissioner um
 
03:29:50.349 --> 03:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
chooses that yes he feels based off the
 
03:29:53.229 --> 03:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
the the evidence that the person should
 
03:29:55.590 --> 03:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
be suspended or revoked or something to
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
that effect and the panel doesn't um
 
03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
really that uh individual lensey could
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
be um in a state of limbo and not
 
03:30:06.070 --> 03:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going to happen um lastly
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
over the past several years we've taken
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
great effort to try to streamline the
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
process in 2013 there were 24
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
investigations that La uh that resulted
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
in some form of sanction the majority of
 
03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
them as we spoke before uh that came up
 
03:30:22.670 --> 03:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
before turned into letter and concerns
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
um which does not get posted on the
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
list uh approximately most of these
 
03:30:30.910 --> 03:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
investigations took about 6 months on
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
average um the length of time an
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
investigation takes really depends on
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
the complexity um as well as um the
 
03:30:41.309 --> 03:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
amount of Investigations that the
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
division is currently uh looking at I
 
03:30:46.269 --> 03:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
believe currently right now we have like
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
38 uh open investigations going uh one
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
of those investigation has many many
 
03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
providers um so it really depends on
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
coordinating schedules doing interviews
 
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
um and lastly the the creation of this
 
03:31:04.110 --> 03:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
panel uh will insert a another step in
 
03:31:07.189 --> 03:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
the process um so once the the the
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner makes their determination
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
makes his determination before it would
 
03:31:15.710 --> 03:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
be final would go before this board um
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
and it would just lengthen the
 
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
process willing take any
 
03:31:23.790 --> 03:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um what comment if
 
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
any does the department have on the on
 
03:31:28.110 --> 03:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
the issue of one person having the final
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
say over someone's um someone's career
 
03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
basically it's not just a job it's the
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
rest of their career um where most other
 
03:31:37.189 --> 03:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
professions have a board or a panel of
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
people experts who actually look at this
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
thing yeah overall the Departments are
 
03:31:44.510 --> 03:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
not opposed to to the panel um it's the
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
stuff that was outlined um as of right
 
03:31:49.510 --> 03:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
now as representative PR mentioned we
 
03:31:52.189 --> 03:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
the current director has spent a lot of
 
03:31:54.269 --> 03:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
time over the past two three years
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
revising the the investigative process
 
03:31:59.469 --> 03:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
um internally the investigator does
 
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
their investigation U poses that
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
information to the director and the
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
bureau chief of EMS uh currently both of
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
them right now are both paramedics um
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief of EMS is required to
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
be a paramedic has part of a job
 
03:32:14.349 --> 03:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
requirement um before this information
 
03:32:16.229 --> 03:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
goes to the commissioner to make a final
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
decision it's vetted by um the senior
 
03:32:21.630 --> 03:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
staff of the division um to provide that
 
03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the commissioner so
 
03:32:26.309 --> 03:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily a formal board but
 
03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
um there is a recommendation um provided
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
at the par at least the paramedic level
 
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
um going to the commissioner so it
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
sounds like he's taken a lot of steps to
 
03:32:39.710 --> 03:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
professionalize that um under his watch
 
03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
or is it he or she
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so but the problem I that I see is
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
um as representative pu said if that
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner leaves the next
 
03:32:51.389 --> 03:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner could undo all that um and
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
it could just go back to one person um
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
if if it was a panel of of individuals
 
03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
who had to vote on taking a a step as
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
far as just revoking a license and the
 
03:33:05.790 --> 03:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner were a member of that panel
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it was an odd number panel would
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
that not also be okay or would do you
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
see that is a
 
03:33:14.309 --> 03:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
problem like the Board of Medicine has
 
03:33:17.070 --> 03:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
to vote to take away a doctor's license
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
that's correct So currently the the one
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
difference between the border of
 
03:33:23.469 --> 03:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
medicine and the uh the EMS license is
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety is responsible
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
for 153 which the commissioner is
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for issuing the licenses
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
versus the Board of Medicine is
 
03:33:33.710 --> 03:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
responsible so essentially the The
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
Entity that is responsible for issuing
 
03:33:37.950 --> 03:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
the license is responsible for revoking
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
the license so in this specific case
 
03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's why the commission has that
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
Authority okay thank you further
 
03:33:46.990 --> 03:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
Newman what's the usual impetus for
 
03:33:51.630 --> 03:33:51.640 align:start position:0%
these investigations is it from within
 
03:33:53.790 --> 03:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
the organization or from outside of the
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
organization um it's actually never
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the organization um it's um 100%
 
03:34:02.750 --> 03:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the investigations that are uh looked
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
into are based off a public complaint so
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
a public complaint could be a another
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
EMS provider it could be a patient that
 
03:34:12.870 --> 03:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
was provided care or something to that
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
effect we're not looking um for issues
 
03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh it's always brought to us from the
 
03:34:23.309 --> 03:34:23.319 align:start position:0%
outside of our organization thank
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
you with regard to the uh other
 
03:34:27.790 --> 03:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative's question um
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
streamlining or or putting a a Time
 
03:34:32.590 --> 03:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
certain to complete an investigation of
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
90 days do you feel that that would be
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
far too short or is is do you see an
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
issue with that um it's a it's partly
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
resource issue um at the division um
 
03:34:45.229 --> 03:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
currently we have one time one full-time
 
03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
investigator and a part-time
 
03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
investigator um so and a lot of it
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
really depends on the complexity of the
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
case some of these cases can be
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
significantly complex in regards to like
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
multiple people that are part of the
 
03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
same incident um so 90 days would
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
definitely be uh in some cases
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
um some of these probably could be done
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
in 90 days um but really depending on
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
the complexity of the case um there are
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
some that uh extend past 6 months um as
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
the representative said we had one that
 
03:35:21.070 --> 03:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
was at 11
 
03:35:23.950 --> 03:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
months what percentage are suspended
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
immediately in other words some of these
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
people continue to work still while
 
03:35:29.469 --> 03:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
they're under investigation and they're
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
able to continue making their their
 
03:35:33.389 --> 03:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
salary to feed their family but some of
 
03:35:35.070 --> 03:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
them are suspended sarily right away
 
03:35:37.150 --> 03:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
during the investigation uh that's
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
correct uh if you give me one
 
03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
correct uh if you give me one
second

03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I have it in the written
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um if I I did just see the
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
information I believe in for 2013 there
 
03:36:01.189 --> 03:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
were four individuals that had an
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
immediate suspension done um and most of
 
03:36:07.710 --> 03:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
them are due to a uh felony level arrest
 
03:36:10.990 --> 03:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
um sexual uh sexual assault domestic
 
03:36:13.550 --> 03:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
violence um something to that effect it
 
03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
has to be a severe where um you know I
 
03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
mean there there's a threat to the
 
03:36:19.150 --> 03:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
public of this person being in the back
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
of the ambulance with an underage
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
individual or something to that effect
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative saor thank you
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
I'm curious I learned this earlier this
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
morning that you know something like 80%
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
of the Departments of the are volunteer
 
03:36:39.389 --> 03:36:39.399 align:start position:0%
versus professional uh paid people so
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's any
 
03:36:42.990 --> 03:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
distinction in how people are um
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
evaluated for their certification based
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
on volunteer and paid status uh from our
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
perspective no um all EMS license
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
providers are treated the same uh
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for the same level
 
03:36:56.910 --> 03:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
of care whether you're a part-time
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
paramedic or a full-time paramedic um
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
State there's Statewide protocols that
 
03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
outline the type of care that you are uh
 
03:37:07.510 --> 03:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
required to give um and I mean full-time
 
03:37:09.189 --> 03:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
paramedics have the ability to practice
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
more often um but the level of
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
expectation when somebody shows up on
 
03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
scene um is for them to be able to
 
03:37:16.389 --> 03:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
provide that level of care that they're
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
licensed to um so it it has no
 
03:37:21.070 --> 03:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
consideration in regards to whether
 
03:37:23.389 --> 03:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
they're full-time or
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
part-time is the department um
 
03:37:28.189 --> 03:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
requesting more time to evaluate the
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that was proposed uh we would
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yes okay thank you how
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%

hereby open the executive session on
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1017 relative to the
 
03:38:03.389 --> 03:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
appointment of Sheriff's and I move

inexpedient to legislate do I have a
 
03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:07.030 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate do I have a
second

03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
second you can do it who did it it
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
repr was actually me but I was giving it
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
to someone else
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
want um I'll speak to my motion uh this
 
03:38:23.349 --> 03:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill regarding the sheriff's uh the
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
sheriff's Association every single
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
Sheriff that's currently holding office
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
in the State uh found it inexpedient to
 
03:38:31.950 --> 03:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
legislate or requested it be inexpedient
 
03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
to legislate um it seems to want to
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
hearken back to the good days of let's
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
get the poshi together and ride out and
 
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
get them um unfortunately those are not
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
the days we live in we have National
 
03:38:45.469 --> 03:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
Guard now available to assist in
 
03:38:48.030 --> 03:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
emergencies of that number of people um
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
randomly deputizing people just sounds
 
03:38:53.469 --> 03:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
like um a bit of a nightmare with regard
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
to asking the sheriffs to oversee
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
Federal investigations and law
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions I don't I just don't
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
even know where to begin it seems very
 
03:39:04.510 --> 03:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to first of all it's an
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate on the counties they
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff even if they did
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to get into arguments
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
between the feds and the sheriffs about
 
03:39:13.469 --> 03:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
what they're doing whether it's
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional when the sheriff doesn't
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
have the access to the investigative
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
files and what they're dealing with it
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
just sets up a nightmare scenario that I
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
I just I understand and appreciate the
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsors concerns regarding certain
 
03:39:29.469 --> 03:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
federal actions that we've all seen
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
however that as frustrating as it is it
 
03:39:32.830 --> 03:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
has to be dealt with at the federal
 
03:39:35.550 --> 03:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
level and we cannot micromanage the
 
03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
federal government um from this level as
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
much as we would like to on occasion um
 
03:39:42.870 --> 03:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
whoever seconded would you like to speak
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
to your motion who was
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
it who who seconded that I thought it
 
03:39:51.790 --> 03:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
was no did you representative n did you
 
03:39:54.910 --> 03:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
second represent oh great Stone can
 
03:39:57.150 --> 03:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
whoever yeah Mr chair uh speaking on my
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
second we did hear the testimony from
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
all the sh the sheriff that all the nine
 
03:40:02.990 --> 03:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
sheriffs currently serving agree that
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bad Bill uh in addition I think
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
it was brought up that uh levels of
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
certification come into play if you're
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
carrying a gun in New Hampshire you're
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
obligated to meet the requirements of
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
police DeMent training along with the
 
03:40:15.790 --> 03:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
additional trainings therefore I think
 
03:40:17.550 --> 03:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
it is a practical matter no sheriff is
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
going to be putting anybody they find to
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
be unsuitable as a
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
deputy further discussion representative
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair yeah in
 
03:40:27.870 --> 03:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
addition I think that they would also
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to be physically fit so they would
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
have to pass a physical fitness Entrance
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
Test and possibly an ongoing three-year
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
thing yeah that that that would be
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
highly important U representative s I I
 
03:40:43.469 --> 03:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
I concur I I was actually asking
 
03:40:45.309 --> 03:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative tenar if you know should
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
something like that happen here would I
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
need to be assigned to the water Brigade
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
water bottle Brigade and I I don't think
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
I'm competent to defend our our
 
03:40:54.429 --> 03:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
protections with that you would be
 
03:40:57.150 --> 03:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
promply handed a Remington uh 870
 
03:40:59.349 --> 03:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
shotgun and sent to the front I would be
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
less confident um further further
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Jam thank you
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh during the testimony I
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
asked about 5946 which requires a
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
citizen to render Aid to a law
 
03:41:15.309 --> 03:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer and that was brushed
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
off um the first part of this bill was
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually uh if there was an emergency
 
03:41:23.110 --> 03:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that they could appoint special
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
deputies they don't need to they can
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
already ask members of the public to act
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
accordingly so I I agree with the itl
 
03:41:32.590 --> 03:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation any further
 
03:41:35.710 --> 03:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
discussion scitech I'm not sure this is
 
03:41:38.950 --> 03:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
worth it but I'd like to I'm more
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
impressed with the read reasons not by
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that they all so what they all
 
03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
do it but I want to know their reasons
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%

technically clearly would allow citizens
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
on the side of the road in the middle of
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
the night regardless of their state of
 
03:43:14.670 --> 03:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
inebriation or sobriety to decide
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not something an officer was
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
doing was constitutional and physically
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
resist and assault the officer based on
 
03:43:24.110 --> 03:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
their interpretation of the law at 3:00
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the morning after leaving a bar um in
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
it's just a recipe for disaster and I
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
just don't think we should even
 
03:43:32.800 --> 03:43:34.590 align:start position:0%
just don't think we should even
entertain

03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
entertain
 
03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you I agree with everything you
 
03:43:39.750 --> 03:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
just said in addition uh I disagree with
 
03:43:42.269 --> 03:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
the see everyone has a right to defense
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
at all times in this scenario you have a
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
you have a duty to submit to the arrest
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
and you can handle it later on in court
 
03:43:49.630 --> 03:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
so I agree thank
 
03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:51.870 align:start position:0%
so I agree thank
you

03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:43:55.710 --> 03:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
discussion who represent wayer thank you
 
03:43:57.550 --> 03:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just wanted to say that I
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate what uh my friend
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
representative Manion and you just said
 
03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
um I do think and I'm voting with the
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
itl on this I do think that there might
 
03:44:09.389 --> 03:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
be in some future legislature uh some
 
03:44:11.550 --> 03:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
benefit to looking at the resisting
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
arrest statute and seeing if we can
 
03:44:16.229 --> 03:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
clarify that to make it so that no
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
officer is using the resisting arrest uh
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
charge to as was testified to scoop
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
somebody up who might just be you know
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
belligerent yeah it seems to me you have
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
to have a an arrest that's legal to
 
03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
actually resist it in the first place
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
that's why it's important last year we
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
we came together and we passed the the
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
assault and bad of police officer bill
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
because that is where you draw the line
 
03:44:41.550 --> 03:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
is when you're assaulting an officer
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
resisting arrest seems very vague to me
 
03:44:45.550 --> 03:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
we passed that bill unfortunately our
 
03:44:47.790 --> 03:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side decided to I
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't even know what to do went into
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
that Abyss that some of our bills often
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
go to um further discussion seeing none
 
03:44:56.429 --> 03:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
and ask the clerk to call oh the clerk
 
03:44:57.429 --> 03:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
wants to
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
discuss thank you Mr chair um I was just
 
03:45:02.429 --> 03:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
going to say that I would support this
 
03:45:06.990 --> 03:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill if we added an amendment to um make
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
assault against police officers illegal
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
like we did last year yeah I think I
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
agree I I think first of all we have to
 
03:45:16.269 --> 03:45:16.279 align:start position:0%
discover where it went and see where the
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
status of it is and um if if not we be
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
we can co-sponsor another one next fall
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
if we all survive the election
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
um um with that I'd ask clerk to call
 
03:45:29.469 --> 03:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
the role motion on floor is an expedient
 
03:45:33.149 --> 03:45:33.159 align:start position:0%

chair votes yes
 
03:46:16.990 --> 03:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
20 and thank you with that 20 any
 
03:46:18.990 --> 03:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
objection to consent seeing none will go
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
on consent I got the report on that one
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
too um I believe uh okay with that yeah
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
did we what did we do with 1017 did we
 
03:46:32.830 --> 03:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
put that on consent or not yes we did
 
03:46:32.840 --> 03:46:33.910 align:start position:0%
put that on consent or not yes we did
thank

03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
you um Mr chair yeah who's oh right here
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
this up um uh just just a point of order
 
03:46:43.710 --> 03:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if bills that have a fiscal
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
note are allowed to go on consent do you
 
03:46:49.950 --> 03:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
know um some of them do and some of them
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't I think the clerk will determine
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not our consent vote is Val
 
03:46:56.469 --> 03:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
or not um because some of them say they
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note and then you look and
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
there's no money I I don't know it's
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
killed anyway yeah if it's killed anyway
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's itl yeah it doesn't matter I think
 
03:47:07.790 --> 03:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah but you may be
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know I'm sure the if
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
he's watching will let us
 
03:47:15.389 --> 03:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
know um with that I uh opened the um
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 1372 and
 
03:47:21.070 --> 03:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
I move in expedient to legislate may I
 
03:47:23.830 --> 03:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
have a second representative har Gite
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
seconded I'll speak to my motion um with
 
03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
regard to prohibiting torture the I
 
03:47:33.670 --> 03:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
believe wholeheartedly in the good
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
intent of the um sponsor however that
 
03:47:40.030 --> 03:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
being said every single thing that we
 
03:47:41.389 --> 03:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
could think of is already covered in
 
03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
statute the reason it says outside of
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
the United States and the federal
 
03:47:46.910 --> 03:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
statute is because within the United
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
States we have laws that prohibit all of
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
the things that could be considered
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
torture whereas in other countries
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
someone might take someone to a country
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a law that covers for
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
example starving somebody or withholding
 
03:48:01.630 --> 03:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
medical care or assult so that's why
 
03:48:03.790 --> 03:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
that's there in my belief I do not
 
03:48:07.510 --> 03:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe this is necessary and um it's it
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
seems more political than probative
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
with that representative GA would you
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
second I just wanted to add that um RSA
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
631 did cover most of this as
 
03:48:23.950 --> 03:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
well that's in his
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill open for discussion representative
 
03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:30.309 align:start position:0%
bill open for discussion representative
um

03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
scitec can't neutr
 
03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
system and not any more than um um
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
Weight Watchers I don't think um
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative Reed I think that we need
 
03:48:42.269 --> 03:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
to look at this a little closer given
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
the current Administration I want to
 
03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
make sure I think we it would be in our
 
03:48:48.910 --> 03:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
best interest to make sure all our laws
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
are airtight as far as torture because
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
um we just assume that it's not going to
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
happen but I think um we really need to
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we're covered I would um
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of um any torture
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
allegations under this Administration
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
having said that the um us I would point
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
you to us code um 1983 it says whoever
 
03:49:15.429 --> 03:49:15.439 align:start position:0%
under the color of
 
03:49:18.469 --> 03:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
Law deprives and paraphrasing deprive
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
someone of their rights under the
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution they are criminally liable
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
no that's the Civil one where you can
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
pay triple damages there's also a
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
criminal law that uh covers that so that
 
03:49:29.550 --> 03:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
means if a government official because
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking Federal does something to
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
deprive someone of their rights under
 
03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
the Constitution they're criminally
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
liable so that would Inc include torture
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely um representative
 
03:49:43.389 --> 03:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr chairman and I
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
respect yours and representative goth
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
right's position on this um I'll be
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl and for uh the
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to prohibit torture I uh
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
very passionate believer in what the I
 
03:50:00.110 --> 03:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
think the United States has become and
 
03:50:02.189 --> 03:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
um or against what the United States has
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
become when it comes to how we treat uh
 
03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
foreign combatants and uh uh people who
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
have been picked up and foreign foreign
 
03:50:13.710 --> 03:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
entities and I think that um uh with
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
George W bush running around making
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
paintings about veterans I think it it's
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
uh incumbent on us to start the
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
conversation about torture what it means
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
and I will see your George W bush
 
03:50:28.429 --> 03:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
paintings and raise you Hunter Biden
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
painting there you go well and I don't
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
want to take out George W bush as he's
 
03:50:33.630 --> 03:50:33.640 align:start position:0%
driving up to Kenny bunkport but I think
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
it would it wouldn't be nice to put him
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
on his toes a little bit when it comes
 
03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
to uh some of the actions taken by the
 
03:50:41.149 --> 03:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
federal Administration in the early
 
03:50:43.389 --> 03:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
2000s and I think I would agree that
 
03:50:44.910 --> 03:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
some of the things that went on at gitmo
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
are quite questionable however again
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's why it's outside the United
 
03:50:50.349 --> 03:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
States and if there was torture they
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's why they kept them there and
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
didn't bring them here because once you
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
get here you have civil rights well
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think this would be just a
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
good sort of put them on their toes sort
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
of thing again that's why I said it's
 
03:51:01.070 --> 03:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
more political than probative it makes a
 
03:51:03.070 --> 03:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
statement and if you wish to support
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
that that's fine um representative Stone
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I spoke with the uh Prime
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor after the hearing and uh I
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
advised him of my concerns with it and
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
he reassured me that the intent that he
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
had was for government officials
 
03:51:18.790 --> 03:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
government entities political
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
subdivisions which was not spelled out
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
in the bill he thought the underc of law
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
would have covered it but for most
 
03:51:26.189 --> 03:51:26.199 align:start position:0%
people I don't know if they picked up on
 
03:51:28.349 --> 03:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
that or not but his prime goal was
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
government entities and I kind of told
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
him that as far as I was concerned at
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
this time the bill is not ready for
 
03:51:35.349 --> 03:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
prime time and that if he wants to work
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
on it he should do that but I I just
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
can't see the language of it sustaining
 
03:51:42.149 --> 03:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
a house vote this time
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
around representative
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
cther I think the question was to him um
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
was he specifically talking about
 
03:51:54.630 --> 03:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:57.790 --> 03:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
yes prisoners yeah okay so people that
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
were in custody yeah that's what the
 
03:52:05.070 --> 03:52:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
about I still think that that's covered
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
by our current representative Pratt
 
03:52:12.990 --> 03:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
would we we be better off to hold this
 
03:52:14.910 --> 03:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
in some fashion as opposed to killing it
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.429 --> 03:52:22.439 align:start position:0%
it I would entertain that but in the
 
03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
second year of bium we really can't um
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
like retain bills that you either have
 
03:52:30.389 --> 03:52:30.399 align:start position:0%
to act on them or not um and if I were
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
to do for example say a study committee
 
03:52:36.389 --> 03:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
out of it that would put us in right in
 
03:52:37.870 --> 03:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of the campaign I mean if you
 
03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to work on on it
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm open to the will of the
 
03:52:44.670 --> 03:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative wheeler just to
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative PR point I think he could
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
table the legislation and then it would
 
03:52:51.630 --> 03:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
be his legislation and he could work on
 
03:52:54.550 --> 03:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment on on the floor and then
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'd be in fav table it yeah or yeah you
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:05.189 --> 03:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
that okay representative uh rhs thank
 
03:53:08.349 --> 03:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I don't know how many
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
bills other committees have and I do
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
realize how many we have and we hear
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot from a sponsor that
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
sits in front of us and the very first
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
thing they say is I would entertain an
 
03:53:23.950 --> 03:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I if you want to do that it is
 
03:53:25.950 --> 03:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
not you know it is not our job as a
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee to go in and make somebody's
 
03:53:30.510 --> 03:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
Bill to the point of passable a
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable Amendment if we hear
 
03:53:35.309 --> 03:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
something you know upon the testimony
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but you know when you
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
bring a bill in front of us and you're
 
03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:39.950 align:start position:0%
bring a bill in front of us and you're
intense

03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
intense
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
is for a law that that's a really big
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
deal and I think that a lot of people
 
03:53:46.710 --> 03:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
sponsors need to take a minute and step
 
03:53:49.070 --> 03:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
back and realize that and do the due
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
diligence that is expected when you're
 
03:53:54.670 --> 03:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
trying to change or make a law and not
 
03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
expect other people to do it so
 
03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
therefore I I will be supporting the itl
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
and if anybody wants to write the bill
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
correctly they're welcome to do so and
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it next
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
year yeah just a reminder we do have
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
latest count 56 bills and that without
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
any getting referred to us um so we if
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
you guys want to get out of here in time
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
to work on your Tans um I would suggest
 
03:54:19.830 --> 03:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
we move along quickly representative
 
03:54:21.349 --> 03:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you I'd also like to point
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
out that much of the language in the
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
bill is prohibited by federal statute
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
and State Statute in itself therefore
 
03:54:29.189 --> 03:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's duplicative as far as regards to
 
03:54:30.910 --> 03:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
prisoners there are enhanced penalties
 
03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
for people in custody that if there is a
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
Act of simple assault or other charges
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
that are brought for them that they do
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
face so therefore even even on its face
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
this entire bill is duplicative of other
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
laws that are in existence and if it's a
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
federal case the feds are going to
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
handle jurisdiction if it's a state case
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
state will have jurisdiction thank you
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
represent I sensed you want yeah I I
 
03:54:53.149 --> 03:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
intend to support the itl but um the one
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
thing that does give me pause is the uh
 
03:54:58.030 --> 03:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh the inclusion of the in the Bill of
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
severe uh mental pain and suffering so
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
look at our looking at our assault
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
statutes and some of our other statutes
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't appear that that is that
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is covered um but thinking it
 
03:55:13.070 --> 03:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
through um that's something um you know
 
03:55:14.790 --> 03:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
for me to make a decision on that is
 
03:55:16.870 --> 03:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
going to require more information uh
 
03:55:19.990 --> 03:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
than I have here at this time um and the
 
03:55:23.189 --> 03:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
information that I have at this time uh
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
basically uh leads me to think that if
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
if this is something that we want to do
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
I think I think uh this is something I
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
think the sponsor and the folks who
 
03:55:34.590 --> 03:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
support him need to kind of go back uh
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
and to really think that through in
 
03:55:39.070 --> 03:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
terms of what it means uh not only for
 
03:55:41.910 --> 03:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
this statute but for other statutes too
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
um uh but for us to uh to pass this uh
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
the the way that it is now I think would
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
be a mistake thank you and I agree that
 
03:55:53.070 --> 03:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways that you could
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
keep someone incarcerated without
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
injuring them that would still be
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
torturous um and and have mental um
 
03:56:02.750 --> 03:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
effects on them I just don't think to
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
your point this this is fine-tuned
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
enough to be that vehicle and given our
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
time constraints I do not think that we
 
03:56:10.990 --> 03:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
to your point also could give it what
 
03:56:12.429 --> 03:56:12.439 align:start position:0%
it's due to actually look into it
 
03:56:13.870 --> 03:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler really quickly Mr
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you I just wanted to say
 
03:56:17.950 --> 03:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
to representative Road's point that uh I
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
have no intention of making all of us
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
stay and work on this on this bill I
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to as I was bringing up the
 
03:56:24.990 --> 03:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
tabling motion was for the sponsor if if
 
03:56:27.790 --> 03:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
the sponsor wanted to use some of his
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
time to readjust this bill table it
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
rework it and bring it back to us I
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
