agenda during then during then I move
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
adoption of the consent agenda uh
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%

the regular agenda that are placed there
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
mistakenly they should be on the consent
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
agenda the first is 202
 
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.670 align:start position:0%
agenda the first is 202
24-5

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
24-5
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
exf the other is 2024
 
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
105 both of those are on the agenda they
 
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
they are on the on the um consent agenda
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
on yes they are on the paper one but uh
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
if if you look at the meeting packets
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
they are not okay right those are the
 
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
ones that we decided the last minute
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
work should be on consent so if anyone
 
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.230 align:start position:0%
work should be on consent so if anyone
is

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
confused see director
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
moral all right any discussion of the
 
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.909 align:start position:0%
moral all right any discussion of the
consent

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
agenda all right hearing none those in
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
favor I I those
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
opposed all right consent to agenda is
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
any PI somebody I heard I heard Peter so
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
all right regular the installation
 
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.629 align:start position:0%
all right regular the installation
Standards

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
Standards
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
Board all right so the reason this is on
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
the regular agenda is because the rules
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
are expired they expired in um 4 of
 
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
22 and PLC
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
10223 didn't take effect until August of
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
23 so there was a big gap in between um
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
the expired rules and the new fee rules
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
um so J car may have questions about
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
fees that may have been
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
um collected yes we do have such a
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
question can you answer them Miss yes
 
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
Tina Kelly rules coordinator office of
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
professional Li Insurance certification
 
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
good morning um no fees were collected
 
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 align:start position:0%
during that time and no actions were
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
really for two years nobody applied and
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
and no discipline that is what I I asked
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
um the people from each of those
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
communicated well that sounds like we
 
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
ought to look into whether we really
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
need that board if they can go for two
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
years with nobody uh lying dealing with
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
them I can't say whether or not anybody
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
applied what I can say is no fees were
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
collected no fees were collect ah okay
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
any opposed all right thank you very
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
you all right Department of
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
energy so this is proposal 2024 28 it's
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
Energy 800 the underground utility
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
damage prevention program the agency did
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
file an amended conditional approval
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
which addressed all my substantive
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
comments however there is a note to the
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee regarding a reference to the
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
energy 200 rules those have not been
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
filed with our office yet um as of right
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
now my understanding is that the
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
department is using the Pu 200 rules
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
which they're allowed to do under RSA 12
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
p14 um however that statute only allows
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
the department to use any of their
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
existing rules until the rules expire
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
are repealed are amended Ed or a period
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
of 5 years has passed whichever occurs
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
first and our office did receive a
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
proposal from the Pu to amend their 200
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
rules so once that is adopted the
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy will no longer be
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
able to use those rules um so there is a
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a question about what rules they
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
will be using and how far out they are
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
of creating their own 200 rules I had a
 
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
very brief conversation with the agency
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
before the meeting and it sounds like
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
should the Pu rules be adopted before
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
any energy 200 rules are put into effect
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
um the agency will then rely on the
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
Justice 800 rules um but there's still a
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
question about how soon they will have
 
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
their own 200 rules in
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
morning uh you probably want to turn
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
your microphone on thank you good
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is David shulock I'm
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
the general counsel at the department of
 
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.110 align:start position:0%
the general counsel at the department of
energy

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
um we do have a plan for adopting new
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
200 rules there is a substantial draft
 
00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:10.430 align:start position:0%
200 rules there is a substantial draft
already

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
done um and we intend to go to
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholder sessions uh in November
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
right uh and those would be informal
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholder sessions to make sure that
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
um our regulated Community um is not
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by the procedural
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
rules that we adopt we had originally uh
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
intended uh with the Pu to do these
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
rules later on right because um you know
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
we have many rule sets that we have to
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
adopt or revise and adopt um after the
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
reorganization uh and we we plotted
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
those out based upon expiration date
 
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
essentially and then you know the 800
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
rules were a matter of opportunity we
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
had an attorney who was able to to do
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
those rules those got moved ahead just a
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
um but everything is done by expiration
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
date and because the 200 rules didn't
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
expire those were planned to do later um
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
which would not have an adverse effect
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the regulated Community because
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
they're accustomed to using those rules
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's and actually changing them might
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
cause them a little bit more work uh
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
than than keeping them so uh we plan to
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
go to stakeholder sessions in in
 
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.670 align:start position:0%
go to stakeholder sessions in in
November

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay any B pres bro do you have a
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm kind of concerned
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
that if these These are the practice and
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
procedure rules correct that's correct
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
and from my limited understanding you
 
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to just take the Pu rules
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
change a few addresses and re and adopt
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
them as your rules because you're not
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
changing your practice the procedure
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
very much is that correct or am I
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
mistaken in
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
something well we we do have to make
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
some changes to the rules because in
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
reorganization some things were jointly
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
given to the two agencies some things
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
are given to both agencies and some
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
things are just given to one agency so
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
there's some sorting out to do okay fine
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
so it should take a little thinking to
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
to sort it out but other than that the
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
these should be the easiest rules for
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
do um you you might think that but we
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
had rules that were going to expire and
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
we had to focus on those absolutely I
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and there there are over
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
20 rule sets right that we have to do
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
this for and and that's the order that
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
we're taking them in okay all right I I
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
could understand repres Senator Lang
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I maybe it's for the uh for
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the room but again my
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
question is I think you said 200's
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
expired or is not enforcable anymore and
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
yet the rules they're using are saying
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
that they have to do their hearings
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the rules that are expired
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
is that did I misunderstand something um
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
so right now they can use the pu2 200
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
rules they are not referenced in this
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
rule set they actually site to the
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
energy 200 rules not the PC 200 but
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
under the statute they can still use the
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
Pu 200 until pu reads their rules which
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
they are in the process of doing at the
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
moment um we have their initial proposal
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
already yeah and you know do that follow
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
up so again so the concern is we adopt
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
their 200 rules before they have their
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
200 rules ready for energy and now we
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
have a conflict of some sort right
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
because energy wouldn't be able to use
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
those anymore um so they would have to
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
either have their own rules in or uh the
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
Justice 800 rules are kind
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
of generic template generic procedural
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
rules that agencies can use um but there
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
are certain procedures that need to be
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
in place before they can use those so as
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
long as the department does that they
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
can then potentially use the Justice 800
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
rules in the meantime but once again yes
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
these rules still just site to the
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
energy 200 rules which are not don't
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
exist they're not in exist
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
this sounds like when we separated the
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
Departments the two departments did not
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
um the two departments had very little
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
notice that there was going to be re a
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
reorganization if you remember it went
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
through the budget cycle and not through
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative uh cycle well aware of
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
that um uh after the reorganization we
 
00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
did coordinate we we had uh meetings
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
with uh the Department of Justice with
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
represent representatives from the
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
Department for both uh uh Department of
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
energy and the Pu uh we worked out
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
schedules uh for uh doing the rules
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
basically on this by expiration date
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
schedule uh we do coordinate a great bit
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
so um the when we do a set of rules the
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
Department because it had more resources
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
um does a set of rules for the
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
department and a set of rules for the
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
commission we do all that basic work for
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
them um and then it goes to the
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
commission and the Department of Justice
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
to review to see whether we have
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately divided the rules based
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
upon the jurisdiction that we have under
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
the revised statutes right which is
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
actually the hardest part to figure out
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
right um and and uh then you know we
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
have proceeded to file our notices of
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
rulem at the same time for sets of rules
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
um the Pu for whatever reason decided to
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
move ahead with its 200 rules uh we've
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
asked them not to do that but they're
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
doing it anyhow uh the rules are a
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
little bit uh problematic for us in what
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
they've done because there are some
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
rules that we absolutely rely
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
on uh such as uh the probably the most
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
important one is their rule for waving
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
other rules right once once they amend
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
that uh which they planned to do uh we
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
would no longer be able to wave anything
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
which um is can be quite a hardship on
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
the regulated Community or a rate payer
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
when they're coming in for some relief
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
if we're not able to to wave a rule
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately so we have asked them not
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
to amend the the there's a there are a
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
number of rules that we absolutely rely
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
on and that don't exist anywhere El else
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
and uh they have agreed not to amend
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
those they're going to restructure their
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
rul making so that those are not uh
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
amended and reopt
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
it would that excuse me would that solve
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
the issue of them not having any rules
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
in place no no it will not so um they
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
they do plan to proceed on the uh
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
procedural rules for adjudications and
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
rul makings um and for those
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
that's where we would default to the
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
Justice rules but so but to to clarify
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
should the Pu pull those sections out of
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
their current proposal and not have them
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
changed in any way or just reopt it then
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes the department of eny could still
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
use those rules okay well then that's
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you that sounds like an elegant
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
way of solving it if you've identified
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
specific ones that you need well it it
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't resolve every problem well um
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
the the the the new pu rules will have a
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
um fiscal impact on our agency um and so
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
we need to work that out with them as
 
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.630 align:start position:0%
we need to work that out with them as
well

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
lovely thank you so when do the Pu 200
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
rules expire and when does your your
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
group plan
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
on bringing your P your 200 rules to
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
Jael car is there is there an overlap or
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
so uh 200 rules don't actually expire
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
what will trigger rules of procedure
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um what will trigger our inability
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
to use them is when you actually approve
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
the rules and they're adopted at that
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
point we won't be able to utilize um the
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
any rules that are amended right all
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
right so is it possible then excuse me
 
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
follow up followup is it possible then
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
to wait for the Pu to
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
wait on their adoption of their rules
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
until this
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
group um gets their rules completed so
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't have that conflict so we
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
we have asked them to do that and
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
they've said
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
no uh but they have agreed to pull out a
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
few specific rules that you absolutely
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
need yes all right that that is a start
 
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.549 align:start position:0%
need yes all right that that is a start
at

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.710 align:start position:0%
at
least

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
we'll we we'll blame the hurriedness of
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
the uh separation for for the
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
mess but um I do hope that you'll be
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
able to accelerate
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
the the writing of your own 200 rules so
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
this you don't have to rely on uh the Pu
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
leaving things
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
alone well we we did um schedule them in
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
advance of when we would have worked on
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
them but it it won't the stakeholder
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
sessions won't start until November all
 
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you but it was it was going
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
to be 2027 so so we we have moved them
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
up that's that's beyond my term of Duty
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
so all right move to
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
approve all right Senator Lang moves to
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
approve senator in seconds
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative brassy can sit in for
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lon who won't be
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
here any any discussion comments
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
questions those in favor I I those
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very much
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
Medicine so this is uh 2024 60 it's on
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
examination requirements for Physicians
 
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
and the only reason it is on the reg
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
regular agenda is because it is expired
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
in May of
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
2022 so there may be questions about how
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
these exams
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
were we're done good
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Shantel wheeler
 
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
rules administrator office of
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
professional lure and certification on
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Board of
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
Medicine say so how on Earth could you
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
let your rules be expired for two years
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
well that is a a question I'm not I
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
can't answer we I um director Courtney
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
has um mentioned before we have the new
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
software system so we are implementing
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been working with the boards
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
carefully to identify expiring rules and
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
start the ru making process um the
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements for exams for the
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
board of medicine is in RSA 32912 and
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
they rule applications excuse me have
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
been processed according to the
 
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
statute under
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
that Senator Lang the new rule is
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
basically the same as the old rule just
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
you and I understand there's no fees in
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
this one so you don't have to worry
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
about that issue not this
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
time move to approve second all
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
right then move to approve any
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
discussion comments
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions those in favor I
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
opposed all right and when is your next
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
rule making starting on do you have any
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
other expired rules that's
 
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
other expired rules that's
see

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
yes and you are in the midst of rule
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
making on them I trust we are
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes all right well we'll see you again
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sure thank
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement trust
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
fund all right so this is item 2024
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
112 um the agency did file a conditional
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
approval request which did address a
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
majority of my comments however I still
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
had one unclear comment on page three of
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval text regarding
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
the reports that need to be filed under
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
the statute it is required that the
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
applicants and government entities file
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
an annual report and that they do so by
 
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
September 1st of each year however the
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
way that this particular rule is written
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
it then goes on to say that the
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
department could require more frequent
 
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
submissions now there's not a question
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the department could require this
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
they can absolutely do so just the fact
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of put under the annual
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
report makes it a bit unclear
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
because the annual report is under the
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
statute the statute says annual so they
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
need different Authority in order to ask
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
for those different submissions and
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
additionally there was a question of how
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
frequent Is frequent they needed some
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
criteria to establish when exactly they
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be asking for additional reports
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
um the agency and I did have some
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
discussions and some draft language was
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
made um that I believe they're going to
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
orally amend their conditional approval
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
request uh with that language and if
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
they do so then that would address my
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
comment good morning good morning Alison
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
radme administrator for the
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit at the
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
Services good morning attorney Robin

guino I'm an attorney for the Department
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services um and that
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
is correct uh before uh coming in here
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
this morning uh we are all in agreement
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh there was two sets of proposed
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
language and um I know we have agreed on
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
that we're going to agree on set number
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
one uh which will split out the current
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh a as written um in into uh A and B
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
and kind of expand on b a little bit for
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
reports okay would you
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh read that to us so we can sure sorry
 
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
what you want want us to vote on it
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh okay so the new a will be
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
applicants in governmental entities
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
shall submit an annual report outlined
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
126-a colon 84 IV I apologize I'm awful
 
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.510 align:start position:0%
126-a colon 84 IV I apologize I'm awful
with

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
Romans um to the department by September
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
1st of each year uh the new B will be if
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
the Department's rules Grant contracts
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
or memoranda of understanding require a
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
more frequent submission the applicants
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
and government entities shall submit a
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
the report a above more frequently than
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
once a year the department shall
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
determine the frequency of submission
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
based on compliance with the
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
Department's rules Grant contracts or
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
memoranda of understanding um and then
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
we will Rel relet uh the existing
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
paragraphs uh under the I do have a
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
concern that that allows you to ask them
 
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
to put that report in every week or
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
every day is what's your expected
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
frequency every quarter or every month
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for asking that question uh
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
from a practical standpoint asking for
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
such a report every day or every week is
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
just more than the department I'm sure
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
can bear um I think that there is no
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
necess there's not necessarily an
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
anticipation of asking for reports at
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
this point more frequently than annually
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
just the idea of keeping the option open
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
because we may have Department may have
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh certain in um vendors who are
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
approved that they might want to keep a
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
closer eye on either because they're um
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
new to the market not necessarily has
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
have been in business quite a while I
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
can't see the department and again this
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
would be speculation on my part but I
 
00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
can't see the department asking for
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
anything at the at the worst case
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
scenario more than monthly and I just
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't see that happening I think I think
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
more reasonably it might be by anually
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I and maybe even quarterly but I
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
don't even necessarily see that
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
happening with the weight that they
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
bear can you reread B for me sure okay
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
so B if the Department's rules Grant
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
contracts or memoranda of understanding
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
require a more frequent submission the
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
applicants and government entities shall
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
submit the report in a above more
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
frequently more frequently than once a
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
year the department shall determine the
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
frequency of submissions based on
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Department's rules
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
Grant contracts or memoranda of
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
understanding so the second half of that
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
sentence was the one I I was concern not
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
concerned with but I was trying to
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
understand again that talks about if you
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
have an issue with an a vendor whatever
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
that may be talks about whether they're
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
in compliance or not so you may have had
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
an issue with a vendor and this would
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
allow you to keep closer tabs on that
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
vendor that might have had a
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary type of action and make
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
them keep their data up faster and
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
sooner so you don't have the problem go
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
on again
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
correct any other
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
questions move to
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
approve I'll second right move by
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang seconded by representative
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
Roa any comments or
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions all right so the motion is to
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
to condition conditionally approve the
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
request and uh those in favor
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
I those opposed all right thank you very
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for clarifying that
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much okay all right the
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
last of our business is a emergency rule
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
Services which is a discussion item
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:26.269 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
um this emergency rule came in last week
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
it relates to youth recreation camps um
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
dealing with RSA 126 U and
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
h901 uh it deals with restraints at
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
youth camps youth recreation camps
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
um there the statute forbids uh such
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
restraints for ordinary
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh camps but it does allow that for
 
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.789 align:start position:0%
uh camps but it does allow that for
State

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
facilities um the concern that I had
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
regarding this uh is what the emergency
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
is at this moment why is this different
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
from two months ago or last year uh
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
particularly given that there are only
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
probably a couple of weeks left in the
 
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.950 align:start position:0%
probably a couple of weeks left in the
Camp

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
season yes good morning uh again Alison
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
radme the administrator for the
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit of the
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
Services good morning my name is Dorian
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
shley I'm the manager of the Bureau of
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification at the
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
department and I appreciate the question
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
um it currently the youth recreation
 
00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:46.519 align:start position:0%
program rules don't specify that
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion practices are
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited at camps so this emergency
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
rule will expressly prohibit that from
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
occurring uh we had received questions
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
from some of the youth camps if this
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
applied to them and we wanted to make
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
sure that they all knew they can't
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
restrain and seclude um we do have camps
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
that run all year round to the point
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
about them ending in a couple weeks we
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
have some that are spring some that are
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
summer some that are fall some that are
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
winter some that are all year round um
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that we have
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
been working collaboratively with the
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
camps all year to um enter into regular
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
Ru making and this will also um they'll
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity during the regular
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
rule making for any public comments or
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
hearing that um because it'll be a
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing at that time we
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
anticipate submitting the final rules
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
probably in September so that when the
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
new um Camp season starts for the bulk
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the summer camps in May um it will
 
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
already be part of the regular Ru
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
comments director moral um
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
this requirement regarding restraints or
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
prohibition on restraints is already in
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
statute it's simply not the issue I
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
guess is it's simply not in the rules
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
and there may be some confusion among
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
Camp owners um but I'm not sure whether
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
that constitutes an emergency or not
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
which is up to the committee to decide
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
so if I may also add on to that so RSA
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
126 U and HC 901 does not include camps
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
so they're not part of the required
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
reporting that's would be schools and um
 
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.830 align:start position:0%
reporting that's would be schools and um
residential

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
youth Child Care residential facilities
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
but camps are not part of that
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
unless so the the question is that the
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
statute does not specifically include
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
Recreation camps and some of the camps
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
are concerned concerned that they might
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
not be able to no so let me try to so
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
right now camps want to know if they
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
have to report when they restrain and
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
seclude according to 126 U the point is
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
is they cannot restrain and seclude this
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
isn't about reporting they're not
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
trained um there's specific training
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
required in both of those statutes that
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
camps aren't trained to do we do not
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
want people staff at camps restraining
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
or secluding our youth that's why it's
 
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.269 align:start position:0%
or secluding our youth that's why it's
an

00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
emergency and there is no reporting
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
requirement since there is no action
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
that would require reporting correct
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
correct but currently there's nothing
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
that prohibits it so they could in fact
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
be restraining and secluding children
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
and not reporting it all right thank you
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else director um I would
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
have to disagree without uh regarding
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
there not being a statutory requirement
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
RSA 17 e
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
E34 Roman 1 I uh requires the
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner to adopt rules for
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
compliance with RSA 126 U regarding the
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
use of physical and medication
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
restraint so there is a statutory
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
requirement in place but I admit it's an
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
entirely different chapter and I can see
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
where people might not uh be aware of it
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
well but that doesn't say that the camps
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
can't seclude or restraint it simply
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
says the commissioner has to have rules
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to do
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
so is that I stand to be corrected but I
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
think 126 U
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
says one of the statutes says that um
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
restraints can only be used by state
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
entities I'm not familiar you mentioned
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
that earlier in your test I'm not
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with what you're referring to
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
there I'm sorry I okay that was a
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
surprise s again I I think this falls
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
under Public Safety right in general if
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
you're the kid that's getting restrained
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
you probably or Camp right you're
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
putting the at risk and I think knowing
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
what the rules are are very important
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
and granted it just came to light that
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
this didn't exist and it's important to
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
get it done while you while you go about
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
your regular rule making process so I'm
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay with this thank you you thank you
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
um my uh understanding about the way
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
camps are regulated um is certainly
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
incomplete um but I do know at one time
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
this was the purview of um Dees and has
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
recently fairly recently become uh gone
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
under the uh consideration of
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh I think there probably a number
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
of questions that still are to be
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
answered perhaps there is it it it might
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
be necessary to look at this statutorily
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
at some point but I can live with this
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
um emergency rule at this point so thank
 
00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:02.839 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this forward than you
 
00:36:02.839 --> 00:36:03.710 align:start position:0%
you for bringing this forward than you
anyone

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
else yeah I'd like to say that I'm
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
interested what will come out of the
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
regular rul making but uh I don't think
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
it can hurt anybody to clarify that they
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
are not to restrain or or seclude
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
children thank you very much all right
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have to take any action because
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's an emergency rule but we will look
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
forward to the uh
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
the permanent rle thank you all right
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
anything else oh yes the equalization
 
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
anything else oh yes the equalization
manual

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:41.270 align:start position:0%
 
letter

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
so the equalization manual from the
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration for
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
those committee members who were not
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
here in 2022 or just it was two years
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
ago so also just a
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
refresher the revenue 28 100 rules came
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
before the committee there was some
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not the
 
00:37:02.319 --> 00:37:03.710 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not the
equalization

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
equalization
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
manual had to be incorporated or could
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
be incorporated by reference or had to
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
be in the rule text it was our office's
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
opinion that it needed to be in the rule
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
text and could not be incorporated
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
because it was a document that's
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
essentially made for the Department of
 
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.069 align:start position:0%
essentially made for the Department of
Revenue

00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
Administration um by the assessment
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
board which is Administrative attached
 
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.349 align:start position:0%
board which is Administrative attached
it

00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
essentially gives the department and
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities requirements on what to
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
do when they are doing uh an
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
equalization of uh property values so
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
during that
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
discussion it was agreed that trying to
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
put the requirements in the rule text
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
was very um difficult for the agency
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
because putting it out rule text it
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't in compliance with the manual
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
there would have been a lot of work
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
needed so at the time the committee
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
approved the rules with the
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that the department would
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
go and get a statutory exemption to
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
allow them to incorporate the manual by
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
reference in their rules which they did
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
however back in June I had a call from
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the New Hampshire Board of
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals and she was
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
inquiring about the incorporation by
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
reference of the equalization manual in
 
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.030 align:start position:0%
reference of the equalization manual in
Revenue

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
800 she could not get into the specifics
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
at that time because it was an ongoing
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
case before the board she just wanted to
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
know if we had an incorporation by
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
reference statement for that particular
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh rule set and I was able to explain to
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
her that we did not at that time because
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
the committee allowed them to move
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
forward and have it in their
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
rules before the statutory exemption
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
came but now that they have the
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
statutory exemption they're allowed to
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
incorporate reference
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
after uh a couple weeks uh end of July I
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
contacted the clerk again to see if the
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
board had issued an order because I was
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
curious and wanted to follow up on this
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
issue and she did send me the written
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
order that was uh given by the board of
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeal it was uh concerning
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
to me because the department essentially
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
took the position that the equalization
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
manual was not a rule and that they did
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
not have to strict comply with it when
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
doing this particular uh
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
Equalization in fact uh their director
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
of Municipal and property division is
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
quoted in the order saying the
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
equalization manual is not a statute is
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
not a rule it's a guideline for the
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
towns to use in the equalization process
 
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%

Equalization manual defined as the
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
approved uh the equalization manual as
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
j9a the department shall annually
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
determine the total Equalization
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
valuation of properties in accordance
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
with sections 1 3 and 8 of the manual
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we had the whole discussion
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this manual could
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
be Incorporation by reference because
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's specifically stated in the rules
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
that this manual is a requirement that
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
the department and municipalities have
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
to follow so now that this issue has
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
come to my attention I have concerns
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
that there is some um
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about what rules are
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
and what the equal Equalization manual
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
is as a rule um so I drafted a letter to
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
the department on behalf of the
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
committee which essentially outlines the
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee's options that they could take
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
at this point in time to address this
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
issue should the committee be concerned
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
about it uh the first is that the
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee could um during the next
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislative session remove the statutory
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
exemption uh from statute and petition
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
the department to then enter rul making
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
to put it directly in their
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
rules uh the other requirement or the
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
other option for the Comm is that the
 
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee could adopt a statute that
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
simply says the equalization manual is
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
to be followed is you know the process
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
that needs to be followed so it's
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
statutory as opposed to rules and
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
therefore there's no question about
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not it needs to be
 
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.589 align:start position:0%
whether or not it needs to be
followed

00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
followed
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh the other uh
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
option is um to petition the department
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
without doing any
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
statutory uh changes to just make it
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
clearer that this is what needs to be
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
followed and done uh even though I don't
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
see how that that would take some some
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
thinking because it's pretty clear to me
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the rule says that well that's it
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
strikes me that the issue is that one
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
side of the Dr is saying the
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
equalization manual is in the rule and
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
you and we and and the T must follow at
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
least this part of it when we're doing
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
an equalization and another part is
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
arguing before the board of tax and land
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
appeals that oh no we don't have to
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
follow our rules and I think that's the
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
concern is that
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
the when
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
challenged they're not saying oh you
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
know you're right we need to follow our
 
00:42:48.119 --> 00:42:49.150 align:start position:0%
know you're right we need to follow our
own

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
rules and in which specifically include
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
the equalization manual they're they're
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of their own rules and
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
that that's something that is up to the
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Dr to straighten
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
out uh so at least in my opinion so and
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's this draft letter could be a
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
first step um if the committee reviewed
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
it and wanted to send it to the
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
department to the commissioner directly
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
to notify them that we are aware of this
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
issue and we're concerned about this
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
issue and that should the issue not be
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
addressed further action may be taken
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
um as kind of a first step if you think
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would be able to um do
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
some internal enely within his
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
Department you know I mean his rules are
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear that they that the
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
agency has to follow these these parts
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
of the manual it's in their rules that
 
00:43:46.839 --> 00:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
of the manual it's in their rules that
say

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
so but director moral I I would just
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
note that any material whether entire
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
document or portions of it that are
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
Incorporated by reference are
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
rules yes yes yes so the uh it sounds
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
like the Dr has a uh a rogue entity
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's out there you know suing being
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
sued by the towns for not following its
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
own rules and we ought to thank the town
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
well at molteno wasn't it it was yes for
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
not follow for bringing it to our
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
attention that the arrays not follow
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
following its own rules right so this
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
letter would would you know start the
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
process it would notify the commissioner
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
of Dr that there's a problem that that
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
the jail car is concerned with um we're
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
obviously not going to send that letter
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
until you guys agree that it's something
 
00:44:46.589 --> 00:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
we should do but we think it's the next
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
step to to kind of put them on notice
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
like we we see what you're doing we see
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
that you're not following your rules and
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
acceptable anyone else
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
so representative Schmid thank you madam
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
chair so you have referred to it several
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
times as a draft letter but but by the
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
same token attorney mun has said that
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
the letter has been sent so no no no it
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
has not been sent no no no well if it
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't been sent did wasn't there just a
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
statement made that the commissioner has
 
00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
statement made that the commissioner has
been

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
notified the commissioner has not yet
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
been notified this letter will notify
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and we can use that
 
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
later yeah so I think we should do this
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
because this is clearly an area of
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
concern that should not be left un
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
addressed all right is there does the
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
discussion move to uh recommend they
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
file a letter so it's an understanding
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
that even jalkar agrees that all the
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
rules those Incorporated by reference
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
are rules and need to be followed second
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay any further
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
discussion all right those in favor
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
letter and uh will it we are interested
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
in seeing what the Dr chooses to reply
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
um and if the committee would like I
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
could also when I send it talk with uh
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
just have them come in and maybe give a
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
brief update on what action they've
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
taken to address the issue uh we love to
 
00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
