with House Bill 1547
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
requiring mileage based exit numbers on
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
tier one
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
highways I recognize uh represent voyd
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move interim study for
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.310 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
com also Jack pretty much same time uh
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
discussion you want to speak to your
 
00:24:58.990 --> 00:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
motion uh
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
in in brief uh as we've heard from a
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Department of
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation um they are certainly
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
capable of making the appropriate
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
changes however the funding is not yet
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
available and it's it's going to be
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
inevitable at at some particular point
 
00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
that we will will be making those
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
changes so interim study is an
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate motion I feel uh so that the
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
planning purposes from a financial
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
perspective can can occur in a more
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%

funding recognize represent Boyd for a
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I would move that
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 1488 with fiscal note be
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
moved to interim study second that
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
motion motion made and seconded
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
discussion uh very briefly if I could Mr
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I am absolutely enthralled with
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
this idea I think it is uh the way that
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
the bill was written is appropriate so I
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
want to thank the sponsor rep Aaron for
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill forward I did have
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
conversations with director buckon who's
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing the plan uh and
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
he said that um they would be able to
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
take on those particular duties um my
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
concern for the interim study motion is
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
it's an offb budget cycle request and I
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
I think it should be vetted directly
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
through the the budgetary process so
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
that a more thorough examination of what
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
the true cost of the program might be in
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
order for it to be effective to some of
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
the impacted communities that would
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
benefit from the program so that's the
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
the Genesis behind my interim study
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
motion thank you thank you that
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
represent cluder did you want to add to
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
that second I appreciate the committee
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh represent boy making this motion
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
that's why I second it because I think
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
this is a very important issue and I've
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
been working with representative uh
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
erron not only on for this bill but
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
bills that are in other communities I
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
know it's a bit of a complicated subject
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
but we really we agree that that whether
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's my community of cyon or her
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
community of aworth and other
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
communities in Sullivan County as well
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
as the rest of the state who has
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
suffered damages from the devastating
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
flaws we've been having because of
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
heavier rain we need to address this
 
00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:21.519 align:start position:0%
issue because some of the towns in cyon
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
and aworth are about the same population
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
and these flaws have been so bad they
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
basically consumed each Town's at least
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
half their Highway budgets trying to fix
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
the problems and this is a real burden
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
on the communities especially since we
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
can't sometimes federal aid takes a long
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
time and it's a real pain thank you very
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
much for making this motion thank you uh
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you represent cluder i' I'd like
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
to address something quickly and then
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
we'll take any other comment I during
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
this last winter uh during two events a
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
a winter and a spring event my towns and
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
District day four of my eight had
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
tremendous damage um and repairs were
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
made um FEMA came in and made you know
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
no promises but told us everyone had to
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
take care of their own damage and that
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
they would be there through the process
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
and if the process were to work and it
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
was to qualify and it only qualifies for
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
properties adjacent to the uh to the
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
highway uh it would be a year plus I
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
have two or three towns sitting there uh
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
that these will be budget Busters
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be no other town no other funds
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
are going to be used for highways if if
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
they're not reimbursed I'm totally in
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation the problem is
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
as represent boy brought up we have
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
already done the budget and to open the
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
budget the chairman and many members on
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle are saying this
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
is not the year to open that back up so
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
I think I think inm study going forward
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's enough money and
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping I'm hoping when this comes
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
back out it'll be some sort of
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
compounding fund that will have uh more
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
money put into it as the years go by so
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
if I could I would be supporting this uh
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's good policy on the
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
second year and I too will support
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
intrum study any other one in the
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%

00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%

pulner Mr chairman thank you I have an
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
amendment friendly technical Amendment
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
um you may recall in
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
the uh discussion we had the we
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
discovered that the
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
original Amendment submitted by the
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
chairman inadvertently in drafting
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
deleted the um effective date clause and
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
didn't replace it so this basically
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
keeps the additional language put in by
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative mak's uh Amendment the
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
same as it
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
is and renumbers what used to be the um
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
line two was the effective date Clause
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's now line clause three so it's
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
oversight thank you um any any questions
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
on the amendment before we vote give you
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
a chance to send it along here I I will
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
say while you have a moment to u to read
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
if you haven't seen it before I'm very
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
appreciative of uh uh representative
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
fauler for pulling this together for us
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I was I was out of this meeting I
 
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
just uh I believe I I've mentioned this
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
to most folks um the parking garage uh
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
planning is is already complete they're
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
going out to speak with the city I
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
believe next week uh to share with them
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
the plan U there are monies from the
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
past capital budget for this purpose
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
that they want to shift those funds back
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
to a capital project here in the uh in
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
the state house so that's what that's
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
about and then as you know police
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
training um had come in with u came in
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
one of their Capital budgets with a
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
surplus but they have an issue um in in
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
their building that their new boilers
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
don't communicate with the thermostats
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
so they they need to appropriate money
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to go down the hall
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
every day and turn systems on and off so
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
um if there's more monies left for that
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
then they this legislation will allow
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
them to use a previously appropriated
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
capital budget there's no opening the
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget and spend the monies
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
that uh would you care to discuss your
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
motion I'll make this very brief because
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
I know that the uh the sponsors in the
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
office uh in the committee room and I do
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for bringing forward
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
with the bill um and I certainly
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate and share your concern for me
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
personally it really comes down to how
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
do we enforce this and that's really the
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
for me that is the main concern behind
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
the uh behind the spirit of Bill is how
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
do we actually enforce this so that's
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
why I'm I'm I moved the uh inexpedient
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.349 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you Mr chairman thank
you

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
ument Mills do you care to speak to your
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
second I do not at this time thank you
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
represent cluder uh yeah and I think I
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank the sponsor for bringing this
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
forward but I just I don't know if it's
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
if it's a a big problem I think it's a
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
problem with enforcement of it and I
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm not a legal expert but
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
could this especially if it were doing
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
this against mean is this an a violation
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
of unfunded mandates and I'm not sure of
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
that but I just I I think right now we
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
try in most cases to take care of our
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
yard debris and from my experience I
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
mean I take from my experience and
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
obviously this you know so I think that
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
it is not necessary at the present time
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
now someday we might need it so I will I
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
frankly will vote itl on this
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you please thank you Mr
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
chairman represent J perhaps the U and
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the bringing the bill
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
forward but perhaps it could use a
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
little tuning up I've seen it in the
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I've
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
seen uh you know
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
residents get yach clippings uh grass
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
clipping out into the street sometimes
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
it gets picked up sometimes it doesn't
 
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
it ends up in a catch Basin uh I do see
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
what the intent might be behind this
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
there may be a little more work to be
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
done on it though okay thank you thank
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%

Campton as the Jane Kellogg State
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
Forest um I would accept a motion by
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
Boyd Mr chairman I would move that house
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
um so boy would you represented would
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
you like speak to your motion yes I do
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I think it's
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
worth pointing out all of us received a
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
lot of emails from citizens in the town
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
of Campton that had nothing but glowing
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
things to say about Jane Kellogg and the
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
work that she's done uh for conservation
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
conservation education environmental
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
issues in her own community and um she
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
certainly based on the anecdotes that
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
were that were sent to us which they
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
were joyful to read and I mean that
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
sincerely it's it's nice to see people
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
in their local community having that
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
kind of local impact on some of the
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
things that we all see here sitting up
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
here at a state level so I think we we
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
should be commending and lauding chane
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
kellar for the work that she's doing in
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
the town of Campton but what I would
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
also say is that there are pieces of
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
land that are owned by the town that may
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
be more befitting that may be more
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
visible to um promote
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
the legacy of Jane Kellogg that would be
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
befitting of the work that she's done as
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to a state forest that from from
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
all accounts is kind of tucked out of
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
the way and it's really you know not on
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
the beaten path there there there isn't
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
a place to park there isn't a place
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
where you can you know congregate and
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
recreate in that particular State Forest
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
and I think um we also learned that it's
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
it's still logged for you know they they
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
manage the the land as well with the
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
state so I think um and I also know and
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
as I've learned that the know we
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
generally have a history of not uh
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
renaming State Forest um here so um my
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
reason behind the nxp to legislate is
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
the history of of how we've handled
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
State Pro State forestry property in the
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
past um and it is not meant to be um
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
dismissive to the to the great work that
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh Jane Kellogg has done in the town of
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
Canada I want that to be publicly clear
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
thank you represent boy represent Jack
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
did you want to add comment to your
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
second uh thank you Mr chairman yes I
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
would uh I'm confident that Jane kog is
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
deserving of Honor for the work that she
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
did on the Moose plate program uh the
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee has had a long-standing
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
practice of not naming artifacts of any
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
kind after living people we have made
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that but as a general
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
policy uh the committee does not do that
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh we did hear testimony that Jane
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
Kellogg is living uh the second uh
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
aspect is the state agency uh
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the forest was opposed
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
to the bill and so I am I am comfortable
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
with in expedient to legislate on this
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Jack
 
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Jack
represent

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
pulner thank you I not going to oppose
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the motion just because I
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
understand there are some other reasons
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
but I did want to state that some of the
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard was that the uh
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
applied the state agency as the one who
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
should be naming
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
State properties and that they were the
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
ones who are better
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
than better position than than this body
 
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:39.559 align:start position:0%
to determine whether somebody's
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
contribution was significant enough to
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
the state so I just want to establish
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
that this is the place where people need
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
to come and that it's not the
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
prerogative of individuals in the you
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
state agency to decide yes or no that
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
this is the right right body but uh in
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
this case I understand the reasons
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
against it thanks thank you
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
point out for the committee that I
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%

resources in the information about the
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
moose plate we heard testimony that due
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%

raised the website is showing more than
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
30 million 20 2023 was the 25th

00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't know if their
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
website I would think it wouldn't need
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
to be legislated but maybe the
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
department could consider adding her
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
name under the information about the
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
