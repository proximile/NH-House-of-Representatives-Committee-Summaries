uh and so what I wanted to just um speak
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
to today is uh in light of the request
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
for conditional approval what sort of
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
remains for us uh as concerns based off
 
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:18.519 align:start position:0%
of what uh what we submitted before U so
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh first um I'd like to say we
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comments made by uh the
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
jail car attorneys that um overlapped
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
with some of our concerns and also the
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
changes that were made in response uh to
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
those recommendations by the Department
 
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.990 align:start position:0%
those recommendations by the Department
of

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
Education um what remains for us is uh
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
still concerns regarding Ed 5111
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
C1 um uh in the conditional approval
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
request uh the language of a summation
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the facts we we believe does not
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient um due process
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
notification um we think the language
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
inherently allows for what we explained
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
in our previous correspondence is
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
investigation notification letters that
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
lack uh specific facts as applied to the
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
code of conduct provision um explaining
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
to a credential holder the basis for
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
that uh initiation of the investigation
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
so we we would suggest that uh there is
 
00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:23.959 align:start position:0%
stronger language uh here that uh
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
notifications so that notifications
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
satisfy due process needs while also
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
providing some cons consistency as to
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
how these
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
notifications uh are structured um going
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
forward so that those are consistent
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of who is occupying positions
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
or in the in the department um and then
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
secondly um we still have uh concerns
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
around the uh Ed
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
51101 um H through J uh some of this was
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
addressed so we appreciate the fact that
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment changed um back from
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
from May to shall uh about the
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that the department um
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
create uh issue a report for the uh
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
credential holder um but the fact that
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
it still contains um the provision
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
choose that the department can choose
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
between creating their own report an
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
investigation or using the school
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
districts uh is is still concerning for
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
us in our comments to the state board
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
and in our email to jel car we we
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
commented previously on why we feel this
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
is an issue in our view um and contrary
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
to legislative intent um we have no
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
issue with a department using facts
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
obtained by a local school district to
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
inform their investigation but it is uh
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
the department that is supposed to
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
handle their investigations and it's the
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
department that ought to be generating
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
um the report that that is true in the
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
language that exists currently um the
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
department uh May H uh state that the
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
this uh language helps uh uh cure our
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
concerns because uh if the department
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
adopts the school districts report um
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
the language states that it would
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
provide a summary statement to the
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
credential holder about uh those facts
 
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.110 align:start position:0%
credential holder about uh those facts
uh

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
substantive uh those fact that those
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
facts substantiate a violation of the
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
code of conduct however we're concerned
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
that the summary statement language in
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
there is still uh too General and that
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
would result in statement that are
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
either vague or unspecific and therefore
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
um not substandard for the requirements
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
under the administrative procedures act
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
um we outlined in our email commenting
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the state board's final proposal uh
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
to permit um the department to again
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
pick either to whether to create their
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
own report or rely on the employment
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
report um and we feel that does not
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
provide the employee with a clear
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
process nor does it require the
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
department to handle its own
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
investigations as I said and uh issue
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
its own findings and code of conduct
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
sanction recommendations based on those
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
findings independent of the employment
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
matter that was uh in the uh employer
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
report um and it does not provide a
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
consistent standard on which to make
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
those decisions if the department has
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
essentially unfettered discretion to
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
rely on different types of
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
Investigations on a case-by Case basis
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
um so and we feel that the legislature
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
should not allow the department to
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
codify language such as this um that
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
makes the application of the rules
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
inherently right for inconsistent
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
application so in concl uh in closing uh
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the time of the committee
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
uh for in the hearing today um the time
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
of uh the department and the uh jail car
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys for looking at our critiques
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
um you know and uh we hope that sh car
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
will urge the department and the State
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
Board to address these remaining uh
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
issues that we are bringing before you
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
today happy to try and answer any
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has thank you
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
questions don't see any thank you very
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
much thank you I believe the uh
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I'm ha happy to
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
answer any questions as it pertains to
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
the uh 511 rules that are before you for
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
consideration in short summary uh the
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
511 rules are the infrastructure by
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
which the department administers the
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
code of conduct the code of conduct uh
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
was passed in late 2018 early 2019 and
 
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
the 511s are really what bring that
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
document to life uh so these revised
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
rules were based on the previous uh
 
00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.829 align:start position:0%
rules were based on the previous uh
original

00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
511s those original 511s we tried to
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
create that infrastructure so that we
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
gave proper notice to credential holders
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
um and gave the department the ability
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
to fully
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
investigate since that time we had the
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to figure out what works and
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
what needed to be revised and the five
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
Els that are before you today for your
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
consideration are really um a
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
culmination of that culmination of the
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
Department's experience listening to our
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from just practical
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
experience of of implementing these
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
cases working with the
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
field and working with the Union um both
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
the school boards Association and Nea
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
gave really great feedback the
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
department was not able to incorporate
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
all of nea's feedback some of it was not
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
feasible so for example um one of the
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions was to notify every
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
credential holder whose name is brought
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
to the attention of the department
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
that's simply not feasible every day the
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
department receives n calls and comments
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
and emails about possible educator
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
misconduct some of it falls within our
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
purview some of it does not some of it
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
we refer back to the district and it's
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
simply not feasible for us to notify
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
every single educator who is brought to
 
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.430 align:start position:0%
every single educator who is brought to
our

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
attention that would simply grind the
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
department to a halt but there were
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
other areas such as the report um that
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
the union had a really good point and
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
the department did the best it could to
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
incorporate that so I'll bring it to
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
your attention that um yes the
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
department we work with the field we
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
work with our stakeholders with our
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
partners and it is the district in most
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
instances of educator misconduct that
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
takes the lead on an inves ation because
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
it is happening in their school it is
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
happening with their employee and they
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
have the resources to do that
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
investigation in fact it is within their
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
purview they have an obligation to do
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
that investigation and it makes more
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
sense for an individual District to do
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
that than it does for the Department to
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
come in as an
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
outsider and and do this
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
investigation however the union had a
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
really good point and that was the
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
school district is doing this
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
investigation for purposes of
 
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
employment and now the department wants
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
to take that factual basis and apply it
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
to the code of conduct and that is why
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
the compromise solution was to say we
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
utilize that factual findings in the
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
district's report and apply it to the
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
code of conduct and we provide that
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
summary in how those facts um apply to
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
the code of
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
conduct I would also point out that for
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
the Department to go into to a school
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
district and do an additional report do
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
their separate investigation would be
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
problematic for the sole reason that we
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
are dealing in large part with
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
children and we don't want to subject
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
them to multiple interviews or what have
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
you so it makes good sense for the
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
Department to rely on the field our
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
partners and utilize that
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
report I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time and your
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
consideration of the 511
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
I thank you I have a question how many
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
of this sort of
 
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
Investigations actually happen per year
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
whatever I can get you the exact numbers
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative um I can tell you that
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
every week every week without fail
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
except in the summertime when things do
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
slow down in the summertime um but every
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
week the department receives either
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
emails or calls of concern um now not
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
all calls and emails warrant in
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
investigation but everything has to be
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
looked at we don't have the luxury of
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
looking the other way because if we do
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
we might have missed an instance in
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
which a child is being harmed that being
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
said a lot of the calls that we get are
 
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.510 align:start position:0%
said a lot of the calls that we get are
employment

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
matters um and so we will reach out to
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
the district coordinate with the
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
district and refer it back but we're
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
still provid providing that constituent
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
with the attention to refer it back to
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
the district to make sure that the issue
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
is properly
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
addressed I will also refer you uh
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire that the
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
department does maintain an active list
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
of what we call revoked and suspended
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
Educators those are Educators who have
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
had action taken on their credential and
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
that list is public it is on our website
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
and every time there's an additional
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
name that is updated and sent out to the
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
districts um our partners at the
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
districts cannot hire those individuals
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
and so they appreciate getting that
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
information on a ongoing current basis
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
and roughly how many names are on that
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
list historically so it is an ongoing
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
list there are well over a hundred names
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
on the list but we break the list into
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
the most recent of this year and there's
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
and please don't quote me on this
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I'm going to
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
Ballpark it for you that's F that's all
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for let's say five five for
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
this year of revoked and suspended we do
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
not put people who have had reprimands
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
that's just a written warning that stays
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
in our file um their electronic educator
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
file and it's not
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
public that seems like a normal
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
employment type issue
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
questions M sh yes Senator thank you
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that it that it's not
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
feasible to notify every educator that
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh who comes to your attention um at
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
what point do you notify the educator
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's an
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
excellent question Senator it's one of
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
the things that we worked very uh
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
diligently on with our
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
511s at some point um when we are
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
looking into a situation when we have
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
reason to believe and it's really set
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
out well in the 511s when we have reason
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
to believe that there is a a code of
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
conduct violation that this is a
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
certified educator right because some
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
Educators aren't certified right a par
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
educator might not be certified they
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
don't have a license from the Department
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
of Education so there's no action for us
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
to take and when once we've determined
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
that it is not that it's more than just
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
an employment issue that there might be
 
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
a violation of the code of conduct and
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
that this is in fact a certified
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
educator that it falls clearly within
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
our jurisdiction then we will place that
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
educator under investigation and that
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
really is a term of art it is a term of
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
art within the department and that is
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
set forth clearly in the 511s and once
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
that person is under
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
investigation we send that individual a
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
certified letter informing them that
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
they are in fact under investigation and
 
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.230 align:start position:0%
they are in fact under investigation and
the

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
basis upon which they are placed under
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
investigation and we list out the
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
alleged violation and the provision of
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct that is alleged to
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
have been violated and a short factual
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
summary and then we sent send a um copy
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
of that letter via regular mail to the
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
employing superintendent and a copy to
 
00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:35.990 align:start position:0%
employing superintendent and a copy to
the

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
union you and one more if I might follow
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
follow please um and I forgive me if I
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
didn't quite get it but you talked about
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
a compromise being reached regarding um
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
investigation using the investigation
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
done by the uh school department
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
versus School District versus um your
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
own can you um
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
give me a little more detail I may have
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
just not no no no sure I I appreciate
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
the the clarity um sometimes I think I'm
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
clear up here and uh I'm not always
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
clear I think representative Lynn has
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
experienced that with me arguing in
 
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.669 align:start position:0%
experienced that with me arguing in
court

00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
um when I looked at the feedback from
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
the Union as I as a we we worked on this
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
um at the department we looked at all
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
the comments that we got and the union
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
was gracious to provide a lot of
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
different feedback and it didn't go
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
unnoticed and every time we got feedback
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
we went back and looked at how we could
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
make the rules better um and so in one
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
particular instance it was that idea of
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
the department relying
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
exclusively on the school district
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
report as I said there are reasons for
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
that namely it is the school district
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
that employs the individual at issue it
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
is the school district has that has
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
access to to people who might be
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and it is the school district
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
that has the obligation to investigate
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue on its
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
campus um
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
however the union had a really good
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
point in that that report is done for
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
employment and a policy violation for
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
employment might not equate to the code
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
of conduct and so what the department
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
proposed to do in the 511s that are
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
before for you is to take the factual
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
basis of that school district
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
report and apply it to the code of
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
conduct and that's where the summary
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
report comes in handy right and that's
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
how we would then apply it to the the
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
code of conduct I hope that answers your
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
question thank you yes thank
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
questions representative hecken
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
Phillips I uh I'm just taking a look at
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
the final proposed um page six and this
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
is really um kind of the area that makes
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
me most concerned it's
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
the um section
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
um f and
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
g concerning well really an
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
H um concerning the investigations and
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
the particularly the words may in
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
subsection h of rule 51 01 I'm sorry I
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
think you're looking at the final
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
proposal and not the conditional
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
approval oh good okay because in the
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
conditional approval those have been
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
changed to Shell great thank you for
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
your help
 
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.230 align:start position:0%
your help
okay

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
okay what it representative Lon um thank
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for being here
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
with this information um my question is
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
just if this process um provides
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient protection when the person
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
who's under investigation for COD of
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
conduct has a higher position within
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
there say it's a principal or a
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent or somebody else with
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
more Authority within the district um
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
does relying on that report um still
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative um as always you ask
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
really good questions um you know the
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
department the code of conduct is
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
equally applicable whether it's to a
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
principal or a superintendent and
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
historic the department has shown that
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be true the department has taken
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
action on a
 
00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:34.710 align:start position:0%
action on a
superintendent

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
um the question of the report this is an
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
excellent question school districts
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes do internal reports where they
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
would assign it perhaps to a title 9
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
coordinator or an assistant principal or
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
or what have you more and more often
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
however school districts are utilizing
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
third-party independent investigators in
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
and really what that translates into is
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
a law firm now they're not required to
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
do that but we are seeing that more and
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
more often and as a matter of best
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
practice that is typically being
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
done just because the school district
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
typically takes the lead on on doing the
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
investigation and that is
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
the understandably the correct uh
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
pathway it doesn't Pro prohibit the
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
department from taking the lead on doing
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
an inv investigation and there have been
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
times where the department has done that
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
I.E if there is a conflict I can tell
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
you historically one of the things we've
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh had happen under the code of
 
00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519 align:start position:0%
conduct that has surprised me is uh
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
we've had a handful of people over the
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
past eight or so years come forward to
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
the department and say you know now I'm
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
in my 40s but when I was in high school
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I had a relationship
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
with an educator
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
and the educator is still working in New
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools and in that
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
instance the department has taken the
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
lead on the investigation not the school
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
district and so there are times where
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
the department would take that lead and
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
I would imagine if you have that kind of
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
inherent conflict that the department
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
would act in that capacity I hope that
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
answers your question it does thank you
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you um and thank you again
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
for um taking this question and I think
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
you just gave an example that I thought
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
would I helped to answer some of what um
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about is you know what
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
what triggers the department to do its
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
own so certainly that was a good example
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
is there anything is it is it that
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
concrete I've been with the department
 
00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.149 align:start position:0%
concrete I've been with the department
since

00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
2015 I I think thinking back and So
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
based on my
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
recollection that's been my experience
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
is that when we've had that those older
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
cases and you hear about them in the
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
news um that's when it's not appropriate
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
for the district to take the lead on
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
that investigation um and the department
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
would come in and do that that has been
 
00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:22.149 align:start position:0%
would come in and do that that has been
my

00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
experience I can't think of another
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
instance um but I I will refer back to
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
to representative Leon's question where
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
when you have that inherent conflict
 
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
where you can't investigate
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
yourself right um that would be
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
something that perhaps the department
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
would say it's probably best if we were
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
to to take lead on that but in large
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
part you know our partners uh at the
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
district they take these cases just as
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
seriously as we do make no doubt it's
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
not just the Department of Education
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
that feels strongly about child safety
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
it is the districts that feel strongly
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
about child safety and so I I feel
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable and confident that in large
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
part the districts would make that
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
decision to say we need to have a third
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
party investigator here thank you thank
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
you ATT and Phillips yeah I think along
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
the same line of questioning um is there
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
a you know policy guide or um further
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
points that you know factors that are
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
weighed when that determination is made
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
of whether or not to seek a contract
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
with an independent investigator
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm just wondering about the
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
standardization of that process and
 
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know the department
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
determines to conduct an
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
investigation through the locality or
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
through you know its office instead of
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
using the locality's report I'm just
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
wondering what are what are the factors
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
deter determining that and is it is it
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
like is there a protocol sheet with a
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
clear decision tree I mean I'm just
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
wondering H how standard is that process
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the short
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
answer to your question question is is
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
no there is no decision tree there is no
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
process the school
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
districts have their own initiative we
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
don't govern them we don't micromanage
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
the school districts the school
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
districts have the obligation to do to
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
do a report to do an investigation to
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
ensure child safety and how they choose
 
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
to do that is within their discretion
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
and their purview um and the department
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
can certainly work with them and partner
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
with them but we're not in a position to
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
to dictate how they would do their
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
report or what decisions they would make
 
00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:33.430 align:start position:0%
report or what decisions they would make
with

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mrs chair Madam chair I
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
am actually was the question was
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
referring how does the department
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it's going to
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
rely on the district's report of
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
Investigation versus hiring an
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
independent contractor or versus
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
handling the investigation itself is
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
there a standard standardized procedure
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
that helps make that determination are
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
there factors that it weighs I'm just
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
wondering you know what is that process
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that decision-making process look
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
like thank you for the
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
clarification um so in large part again
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
the the department will rely upon the
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
report that's done at the local level uh
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
we do this for a variety of reasons uh
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
first and foremost it is the district
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
that has access to the people involved
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
and um again we are dealing with
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
children and we don't want to subject
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
children to multiple interviews we want
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
to be thoughtful about how that work is
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
done and so in large part the standard
 
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
protocol is if the district does a
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
report the department will rely upon
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
that if there are if it is an
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
insufficient report or if there are
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
still questions lingering then the
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
department can go in and ask some
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
additional questions get some additional
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
information but first and foremost we
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
will rely upon the report that the
 
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.549 align:start position:0%
will rely upon the report that the
district

00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
conducts okay Madam ch I just I thought
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the law was that the
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
in that the department shall investigate
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little worried about having a
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
default Reliance on the locality's
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
investigation first I don't it doesn't
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
sound like that aligns with the intent
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
law thank you are there are there any
 
00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:19.950 align:start position:0%
law thank you are there are there any
other

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
questions all right is does anyone have
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the unrepresentative
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips comment
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
you I well I guess I
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
mean correct me if I'm wrong Miss for
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
but I I I I I did not interpret what you
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
were saying or even what the what the
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
union representative was saying earlier
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
as meaning that the department just sort
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
of it gets the report and just sort of
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
blesses it I assume that you the
 
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.350 align:start position:0%
blesses it I assume that you the
department

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
makes makes some analysis of the report
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
to make a judgment of its own does this
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
report uh can can we adopt this report
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
is it something that we can say we're
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable with or not um uh so and if
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
that's the case then I don't see what
 
00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
that's the case then I don't see what
you

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
know I I don't I don't have any problem
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
at all with that if the your statement
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
is accurate yes we look at the report if
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
we have other information we'll we'll
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
weigh it all out but yes we look at that
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
report and see if it's applicable to the
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
code of conduct and and if I mean if you
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
came if the if the report was you know
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
something that you came away with saying
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
saying wait a minute this is this is
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
really sloppy or they didn't there's you
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
know there were aspects of this that the
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the that the local school district
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't investigate they didn't
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
interview this person who seemed like an
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
obvious witness or something like that
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
then I assume I would assume that you
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
would say wait wait a minute we're not
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
this report isn't sufficient we're going
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
have to do more or we're going to have
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
to tell the school district to do more
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
or something like that yes
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn you were correct not
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
only do we engage in that practice we
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
have done that practice historically and
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
again it comes down to working with our
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
partners at the district and saying to
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
them this report is insufficient have
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
you looked at this additional
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
information what have you yes everything
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
you said is correct and I I mean I
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
understand where representative hackin
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
ph's point but I it seems to me that if
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
once once you done that then it really
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
is the Department's judgment that to say
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
we we adopt in effect this this uh this
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
report because we think it's it's it's
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
been done properly I I I I guess I don't
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
have any problem with them with the
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
Department doing
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
that okay is there a motion
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative GES I just had a further
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
comment on that you know because I think
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
the administrative procedure is as
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative harken Philips said said
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
requires that they do an investigation
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
and I can understand representative Lynn
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
you say that you know you get the report
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
and and you say you know maybe somebody
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
was missed or something how would they
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
know unless they did that investigation
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
and then what and in what area is there
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
anything in that act that says they can
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
delegate this responsibility of not
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
doing an investigation letting somebody
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
else do it and just taking it ver you
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
know taking that report and saying well
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
we just we accept it because we've
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
looked at it it looks good but without
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
doing an investigation how how do you
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
really know that's the thing and I and I
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
think that's the problem that I have
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
that they should they should do the
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
investigation as well because that's
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
what's required under the the ACT you
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
know legislation is they requiring
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
it yeah Madam chair just to build off
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know how do we know the
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
standardized process of evaluating these
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
local reports qualify as an adequate
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
investigation if the attorney present
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
here today said there's no standardized
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
procedure for for that so I'm just
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble there each
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
district is unique I'm sure
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon I just want to make
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
one clarification the administrative
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
procedures act does not require the
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
department to do an investigation it
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
statute um thank you madam chair um I I
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
recognize that that some of my
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
colleagues have some concerns with this
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
but I I believe that our school school
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
districts are working hard to protect
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
students and to protect the rights of
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
the Educators as well I recognize that
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
they may miss something from time to
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
time but I think that it would be a
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
pretty big systemic issue if we had to
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
if we were not trusting the districts
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
being able to look into these because I
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
do recognize that occasionally there may
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
be a pattern where we do find out that
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
there's a that there's a problem in
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
these investigations but I think that
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
would actually become a much larger
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
issue and I believe that we should trust
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
our local districts unless we have
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
unless we have good reason not
 
00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
unless we have good reason not
to

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right does someone have a
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
motion Senator Ward moves to approve
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
second sen representative Lynn second
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion comments you Senator
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
chandelly I'm sorry I just I noticed
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
that Brian Hawkins was raising his hand
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that's appropriate
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
for him to speak or
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
not it would be just to clarify our uh
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
uh La CH attorney with NE uh just to
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
clarify to that point on the Union's
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
position um and I I think the the
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
conversation's directly uh centered on
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
our concern where you have the local
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
level investigation happening there's
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
certainly that's happening and they're
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
doing generally a good good job at that
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
but the context in which that
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
investigation's happening is the
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
employment context so they have an
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
employment policy that they're looking
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
at when they're doing that investigation
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
they're not looking at the code of
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
conduct and we would argue they don't
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction to look at the code of
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
conduct so that's the report you're
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
getting and so argument and the rules
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
contemplate that the um investigation is
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
done by the doe currently and I think
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
there's been a practice that the local
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
school district's report is adopted
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
however that is the inherent problem
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
with that it's contemplating
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
investigations done by the district
 
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
because you're looking at a different
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
set of policies and so that was our Our
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
concern and now we have a further
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
concern with the change because now they
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
can choose which one they want to do
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
with no standard we don't know which
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
one's going to happen that's hard for
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
the practitioner to represent our client
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
and know are they going to go with the
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
school district report and we have an
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
argument with that or are they going to
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
do their own investigation and why
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
what's the difference we can't counsil
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
them on that that's the inherent problem
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
when you actually start working through
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
these rules when we can't rely on the
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
investigation happen at the doe level
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
and that's the Union's position
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
mainly uh excuse me
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm having a hard time thinking of
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
something that the district would
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
consider a serious employment issue that
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
was not covered by the the Educators
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
code of conduct could you enlighten me
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
if there is such a thing sure uh there's
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
many instances where you might have um a
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment claim or something to
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
that effect or you could have a uh
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
physical contact you could have a a
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
variety of things but they're looking at
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
District policy they might be looking at
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
the restraint law but that's that's the
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
charge that the investigation's on and
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
then you have the code of conduct a lot
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
of times that doesn't just mirror the
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
district policy they're two different
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
analysis so while one they might overlap
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
certainly but there has to be an
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
additional application of the facts to
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct done by the
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
department that has jurisdiction over it
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
could could I I'm I'm you're you're
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
confusing me even more I can't imagine
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
that sexual or physical abuse would not
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
be against both the district policy and
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct it may it may they
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
certainly overlap I mean there's but the
 
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
the problem is the context that you're
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
looking at and you can come up with a
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
variety of examples the employment
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
context that's what the investigator is
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
doing it's it's it's within the
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
employment contact so also the
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
practitioners that are working with the
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
the clients are only speaking to the the
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
job and the termination or something to
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
that effect we're not looking at the
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
code of conduct during the investigation
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
so a if I understand you correctly in
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
some weird case the school district
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
could investigate decide someone has
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
violated their policy and fire them for
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
Vi violating their policy while the
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
department says well it doesn't affect
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct is that correct
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
there may be instances where something
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
violates something on the local level
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
and doesn't violate the code of conduct
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
but it's also I mean you can certainly
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
have the report but you can't stand in
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
the shoes of the local level if you're
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
not doing the investigation because
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
there and there there's going to be
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
instances where errors are made because
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
you have not done the investigation you
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
have not talked to the witnesses you
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
might not know exactly what happened in
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
that investigation but for reading the
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
then please yeah you know I I I believe
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
have to Echo what what the just said I I
 
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
can you give me a a specific example of
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
a situation where some kind of you know
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
sexual you you use the example of uh
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
sexual some kind of sexual harassment or
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of touching of a student um
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
can you give me an example of where that
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
would be something that would violate uh
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
that that would violate the you know
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship between the
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
student I mean between the school and
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
the teacher uh but not be something that
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
the department would have jurisdiction
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
to investigate because I'm I'm as
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
confused as a chair is I don't quite see
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
where that could happen no I don't I
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that's necessarily what I
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
was saying so there certainly they have
 
00:43:17.309 --> 00:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
miror instances but they're two separate
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
matters so I think a lot of times that
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
if you want a more concrete example it's
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's more low-level issues so there
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
might be something in the context of um
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know a teacher speaks to a student
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate fashion but it's a
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
more lowlevel very low-level
 
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
more lowlevel very low-level
conversation

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
just a bit of a boundary issue and and
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
our argument would be at the local level
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
that suffices to handle that matter and
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
it doesn't rise to a level of a code of
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
conduct violation so they should do
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
their own investigation they can't just
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
rely on the lower level it doesn't just
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
mirror exactly what's going on because
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
there's two separate analysis of whether
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
it could be a code of conduct violation
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
but isn't what but when when you say
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
investig isn't the isn't the issue
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
really in that in in the example that
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
you're giving about you know what you
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
describe as a lower level a lower level
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
thing the issue is not the need for an
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
investigation it's what it's what you
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
just said it's whether or not the
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
department should consider this
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient you know of sufficient
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
severity to take some kind of
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action it's not and so in
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
in that context I can't understand why
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
it might not be entirely appropriate for
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
the for the Department to rely on the on
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
the factual investigation that was done
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
by the by The Local District and that's
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
what we're we're saying in in a way but
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
the thing is there that that's a
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
standard practice that we're asking for
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
right so I don't I don't think I think
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is if we have a notice of
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
Investigation to a credential holder and
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
then you receive um that the
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
investigation's complete a day after by
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
the doe and that's all you receive that
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's been a violation found we would
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
like to see an investigation done by the
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
doe or at least notice of what the
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
application of the code of conduct is to
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
what the investigation report was done
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
at the district where there has to be
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
level isn't that what the rule says that
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
if they adopt the factual basis it'll
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
provide a summary statement informing
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
the viil that it has adopted the factual
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
basis and how those facts substantiated
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
a violation of the code of conduct so
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
you can't just say yes we received the
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
report and you're reprimanded you have
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
to say we received the report analyzed
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
it and these actions as reported by the
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
district violate the code of conduct in
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
this way is that the kind of thing that
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
would be in the
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
report I've never as a practitioner I've
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
never received that I've received just a
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
letter saying it's a violation so that
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
certainly is a good step we would agree
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
well that's yeah that's what the rule
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
says that they'll be doing um so the the
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
issue is that in your experience that
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened I have never received a
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
full report analysis from the doe in a
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
case well that sounds like something
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
that they uh are signing up to do by
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
this revision to the rule representative
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
ly just to sort of follow up in what
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
Miss foron was saying I mean
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
is if the department has to do its own
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
investigation then you know let's take
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
the example of the sexual harassment or
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
sexual assault situation what you're
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
really saying is after the school
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
district has interviewed the child or
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the department has to do it
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
again and isn't there really a strong
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
interest in not having uh children
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
subjected to multiple interviews uh
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
about these kind of things I mean I I I
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
I would think this that there's a strong
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
interest in in not having to do that
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
again unless it's necessary I mean I
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
could certainly see if the school
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
district really did a very sloppy job
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
and left things un absolutely I think
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
you have a very valid point but if the
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
department looks at it and and and
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
determines that the school district did
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
a really good job then to just say well
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
you you know you have to do it sort of
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
all over again um I I can I don't see
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for that and I can see really
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
strong reasons why you would not want
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
that to happen repres
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um looking at
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
this it's not only adopting the factual
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
basis the school district's in
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
investigative report it also includes a
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement's investigative report
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
so if we're looking at sexual assault of
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
a child uh the going through three
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
processes between the district law
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the department would
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
just have a chilling effect on children
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
reporting this I don't think that's an
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
and it's an or so it could be the school
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
district's independent investigative
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
report or law enforcement report so it's
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
not an an situation and then where would
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
be the criteria so I the question is do
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
we have there is needs to be some level
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
of some amount of discretion that's
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
applied on a reasonable basis because
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
are we going to have a statute are we
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
going to have the rules specifically
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
call out when it's when it's relying on
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement because it's potential
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
that in a case of of um potential
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
assault between um even between adults
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
within the school the law enforcement
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
may not have decided to to take this up
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
they may have decided not to the case
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
then do we just have have a default
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
where we have to rely on the law
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement report um when they've
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
decided that there's not enough for them
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
to investigate and then we wouldn't look
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
at the school district um I I I
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
recognize the challenges with this and I
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
see echoes in other areas within our
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
laws and administrative rules when
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
especially when children are involved um
 
00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
but I I see that this is evolving based
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
upon what we're learning with the code
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
of conduct and the idea that you know
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
this may not be the final last answer um
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
I think is something for us to consider
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
but I'm still trying to understand how
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
boundary issues with a student wouldn't
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
be under the code of conduct when it
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
says that un unprofessional conduct
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
should include but not be limited to um
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety and well-being of
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
students um I I I see that the code of
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
conduct possibly goes broader than the
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
employment issues but I have a hard time
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
seeing where an employment issue other
 
00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
than maybe attendance or calling out for
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
too many sick days um wouldn't fall
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
under the code of conduct and I think
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
that too many sick days or something
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
else like that um really would be
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
dismissed as any potential code of
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
immediately anyone else um just a
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
clarification on or um or does mean and
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's one or two or both you would
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
have to say one or two not both to to
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes so that if there is a law
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement report it will be considered
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure in many cases there
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
isn't all right anyone
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
else all right the motion is to approve
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
the ru
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
the amended
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh amended conditional
 
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.750 align:start position:0%
uh amended conditional
approval

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay those in favor Hi I hi was opposed
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
no okay we have two representative
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
grassy and hacken Phillips voted no and
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I think that the
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
department will need to make sure that
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
those reports do include the information
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
that the union says is not always there
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
or they haven't seen because that that
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
is an important part if you're relying
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.870 align:start position:0%
 
investigations

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
right Department of uh environmental
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
services so this is
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
20246 it's uh regarding the voluntary
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
certified salt applicator program um and
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
the only issue with with this is that it
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
is a delay in Ru making the laws were
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
promulgated in 2021 and we are just now
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
getting rules now and there is a fee in
 
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
the rule of $450 uh doar so there this
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
is a voluntary program but there there
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
may be questions about how it was
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
enforced before the worlds yes there are
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
definitely questions about how it was
 
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.390 align:start position:0%
definitely questions about how it was
enforced

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Courtney Lockwood
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
attorney for the Department of
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and good morning
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
Steve Landry Department of Environmental
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
supervisor yes so I was I remember with
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
passing this law and have have you been
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
issuing these voluntary certifications
 
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.510 align:start position:0%
issuing these voluntary certifications
since

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
2021 not for the municipal program yet
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
so that program is not in place yet
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
because we haven't had rules so we have
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
not collected application fees under the
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
municipal part um we are not going to do
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
that until these rules are adopted what
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
other part is there other than Municipal
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
the municipal was added there's a
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
commercial part
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
already so we were collecting fees under
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
applicators this only includes the M
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
Municipal ah
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay I don't remember the distinction
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
but thank you for for
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
clarifying are there any questions from
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
the committee repr hack and Phillips um
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
not a question but just a comment under
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
the um public comment section for the
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
definition of a snow
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
boss uh this was quite humorous to me
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
when I read it um you know the comment
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
seems that uh snow boss seems old school
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
appears negative and less professional
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
and as a result the department chose to
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
change the name to the green snow Pro
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
coordinator I I just want to throw it
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
out into the universe that I believe
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
snow boss was totally a positive
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
connotation and I I'm sad to see its
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
name go and replac it with to to more
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
words but um you know if there is some
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
sort of movement to bring back snow boss
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
I would be supportive I uh completely
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
agree with you but it was not a reason
 
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.150 align:start position:0%
agree with you but it was not a reason
for

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
objection Green Snow Pro coordinator I'm
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the uh
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
regulated Community still uses the term
 
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.470 align:start position:0%
regulated Community still uses the term
Snow

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
Snow
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
else can I make a motion to approve yes
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
second any further discussion questions
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
comments those in favor I oppos
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
Nursing Madam chair this is an emergency
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
rule from uh the board of nursing
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
involves uh LNA lure uh by competency
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
exam or comparable
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
education uh a couple of concerns um one
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
is that the basis for this is
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
that um there is a imminent Peril to
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
Public Health or safety due to a
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
shortage of lnas but I think that's an
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
ongoing problem that's been around for a
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
few years um I and I don't don't think
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
that has changed the big problem is that
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
when the emergency rule was done it was
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
based on a set of rules an old set of
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
rules uh from 2022 since that time
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
another set of rules had been adopted by
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
basing on the rules in
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
2022 uh the emergency rule actually has
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
the effect of not allowing uh
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
experienced military medical personnel
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
or EMTs from using that experience to
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
fulfill the requirements of an LNA
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
license uh this was just an oversight by
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
U and there are other things there is
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
conflict with uh two that the statute
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
requires um military uh medical
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
experience and trained EMTs from uh
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
being allowed uh there is also um a
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
conflict with RSA 3104 because it's
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the old PLC that's
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
overseeing this and by using the older
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
version of the rule it's the board uh
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's also a conflict now uh with one
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
forms this could be remedied by the
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee petitioning the Board of
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
Nursing to repeal the emergency Rule and
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
then if they if the Board of Nursing
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
felt that there was still an emergency
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
they could at the same meeting uh adopt
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
rule from the board good morning Madam
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
chair my name is Shantel wheeler I am
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
rules administrator with the office of
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
professional Li insur and
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
certification you have to be closer to
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
the mic not being picked
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
up better oh yeah and so do you have any
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh issues with us doing as director
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
moral suggested no issues the board is
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
meeting next week and I anticipate that
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
this could be remedied then thank you
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd like to say I'm very
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
disappointed that the board is using
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
a an old ver old version of the rules as
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
the basis for anything because we have
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
made a number of changes to statute that
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
are reflected in those rules and uh I
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
hope they will use the correct version
 
00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:53.230 align:start position:0%
hope they will use the correct version
this

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
time we write them any other uh
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:59.349 align:start position:0%
time we write them any other uh
action

00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
you Department of Safety let's hope we
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
can get out of here before the bag pipes
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
start Madam chair yes uh if the
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to uh request nursing
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
to repeal the rule then we would there
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
need to be a motion and a
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
vote I will so move I'll second okay
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
those in favor I I opposed okay thank
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
you very much you've been officially
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
safety director
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
moral thank you um this is an emergency
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
rule regarding um the majority of safc
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
1800 commercial driver licensing rules
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
um it appears the basis for emergency is
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the regular rules expired in
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
mid-February um as I was going through
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
the emergency rules yesterday in
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
preparation for the meeting I decided to
 
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:13.160 align:start position:0%
do a a look back into the filing history
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
for safc
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
1800 uh prior to the emergency rule
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
there were 10 rule makings uh three of
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
those simply dealt with amending a few
 
00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:26.789 align:start position:0%
those simply dealt with amending a few
sections

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
out of the other seven uh four of the
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
rules expired two of the others uh two
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
of the remaining three uh would have
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
expired but for interim rules adopted
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
the same day that the rules were expired
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
pattern

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
pattern
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
yes you from the Department your your
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%

01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
regards to the emergency requests on the
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
rule set um you know certainly this is
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
not a position that we want to be in um
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know and so what I will say is I've
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee before
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
I've been in the position that I'm in
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
for uh just over two years now we um
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
within the division are making
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
amazing strides with regards to um
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
administrative process and um making
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
sure that we're looking at uh our rules
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
the laws uh our forms and that we're
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
doing everything uh by the numbers for
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of the committee and what we
 
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
should be doing um for process within
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
the agency I will say that um within the
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
driver Licensing Bureau which is where
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
this rule Set uh ultimately lives we
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
have had some supervisory changes there
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh over the past year um and uh so how
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
do we Rectify this in the future better
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
oversight I can tell you that I have a
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
um monthly meet meeting with um
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety legal we review all
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
legal requests that are in there often
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
times um there are rule requests that
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
are in uh the legal unit request
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
SharePoint that being said we just
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
recently established a monthly meeting
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the month with
 
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety legal we just had
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
our first one last week we went through
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
the 28 rule sets that are on the DMV
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
website uh fortunately we've been heavy
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
with rule updates over the past two
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
years with some of our biggest rules
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
with um title registration driver
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
licensing uh we just reviewed and and
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
forwarded the uh motorcycle rider
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
training program rules the ignition and
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
the lock device rule set that I've
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee before
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
mobile inspection rules uh we just
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday went through the Pupil
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation rule set um and we're
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to be do doing the same with the
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
driver's education rule set I say all
 
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
that um because it's a partnership
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
between the DMV and Department of Safety
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
legal and what we're going to be doing
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
is at the beginning of every month we
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a standing meeting to review those
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
28 rule sets we already did there are
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
only I believe five that are coming up
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
in 20 uh 25 and 26 um so we we are in a
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
good position however uh this is
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
unacceptable and um we uh we will track
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
it in the future
 
01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
and have you been issuing uh commercial
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
driver licenses in the meanwhile yes and
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
collecting the fees
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
yes are those fees only in the rule Mr
