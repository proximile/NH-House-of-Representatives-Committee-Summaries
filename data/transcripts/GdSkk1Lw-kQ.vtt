00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.500
All right, it's 9.06 or so, and I'm going to call the House Judiciary Committee to order.

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.500
And first, please stand and join me in the Pledge of Allegiance.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:57.000
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God and I'm gonna call the prime sponsor representative jr hool good morning everybody representative whole excuse me serving the towns of dunbarton hooks at allenstown and epsom here in support of houseville 1664.

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.500
um hooks at allenstown and epsom here in support of house bill 1664.

12
00:01:03.500 --> 00:02:05.000
the bill before you um expands some of the options available to those who choose to detransition why do i say that we currently have in our laws medical malpractice options we have them for for lots of could be someone had a surgery a friend had a hernia surgery and the mesh they put in created unintended consequences this is routine we do this all the time the difference we're talking about here is we have a minor who may or may not have consented, and I'll come back to that point, to various drugs along the way, or medications, or even surgery, who then potentially years later, excuse me, finds out that there were some unintended consequences of what they did.

13
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.500
Now, in the state of New Hampshire, we limit what miners can do.

14
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.500
I'm going to pass out a bill that passed in this house in 2015.

15
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:32.000
We decided in 2016, or sorry, 2015, because some young woman had cancer resulting from tanning, that we would prohibit going to tanning booths at age 18.

16
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.500
And that passed, became law.

17
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.000
House Bill 136, I'm sending it around right now.

18
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Why does that matter?

19
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We realized as a legislature that minors don't have certain cognitive skills necessary to make really difficult decisions.

20
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.500
And in this case, that was relative to tanning.

21
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Now, I voted against that bill because I believe there could be compelling reasons that a minor may want to go to a tanning salon prior to a prom or whatever else.

22
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.000
There might be medical reasons to go to a tanning salon.

23
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But at the end of the day, this legislature and the Senate and the governor agree that this was a good prohibition to have in place.

24
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.500
if we're going to prohibit something as mundane as scanning for minors, theoretically, we could prohibit something as significant as surgery.

25
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.500
This pill doesn't do that, though.

26
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.000
I don't like to try and prohibit things with the use of government.

27
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.500
I don't know that that's the appropriate use sometimes.

28
00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:14.500
I think it makes more sense to make sure the playing field is level between the patient and the provider, such that when they learn about the unintended consequences of some of the decisions, they have legal options later on in life.

29
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.500
We already have, under RSA 507E, right, a cause-based system relative to medical injury.

30
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:37.000
All this bill is doing is extending it to those who might realize later on in life that they had permanent harm relative to the procedures they received as a minor.

31
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The important point in all of this is we're talking about minors who are making lifelong medical decisions, and we don't allow minors that level of authority in anything else.

32
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.500
We've determined as a society, 18 is the age where someone now is legally able to consent to something.

33
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:22.000
So in the case of minors who have, quote, consented, unquote, to whether it's medical treatments, whether it's medical surgery, they may not have the cognitive skills necessary to understand what they have been told to do or allowed to do.

34
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Who is liable during that period of time?

35
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Is it the provider?

36
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Is it the parent?

37
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:45.000
There's an adult somewhere in that room who is making, is signing a piece of paper because the minor can't sign that piece of paper to say yes for seed.

38
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.500
This allows that minor their only shot at getting a chance to address any unintended harm from what happened.

39
00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:15.000
Cutting off testosterone or estrogen doesn't seem like a big deal, but theoretically, that could have real long-term effects to the patient or to the minor as they grow up when their reproductive organs haven't fully developed or have developed incorrectly.

40
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:28.500
Obviously, transition surgery potentially causes real harm by cutting off functional body parts to the point where this person may not be able to ever have children.

41
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.000
We might sterilize these minors before they're an adult.

42
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I think they have, they deserve the right to address that issue.

43
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:54.000
This bill just goes through, it creates the definitions necessary to be clear about what you can do relative to cross-sex hormones, transition surgery, medical detransition, and puberty blocking drugs.

44
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:50.500
And then in 507E7e and this is page two it starts to allow for the minor to have access to a longer time period necessary to figure out if there was harm done and i did it with a fixed date as opposed to after it like they start their detransition because that's a little bit more nebulous in my eyes than this here which is they get they get to their mid-30s well late 30s and i said that because the average age that not the average age the top end of the age where children where adults are now having children is in their late 30s That's where society has moved.

45
00:07:50.500 --> 00:08:05.500
My wife and I had our children in our early 30s, but unfortunately as society has moved on, a number of parents are having their children in their late 30s.

46
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:30.500
If it's only then when the child has a chance to learn that maybe they're sterile, maybe there's unintended consequences, and they're having trouble having children, why can't they then go back to their provider and ask for some remuneration because what happened to them as a minor sterilized them?

47
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:58.500
So in summary, the bill takes our current law and allows those who would like to seek detransition because of some harm a chance to get a level playing field with the provider that happened along the way that's about it um i can answer any questions specifically to the legislation if necessary all right Kutub.

48
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:06.500
Can you please point to me where it states that this only applies to a minor?

49
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:26.000
Because the way I'm seeing it, this applies to anybody, including a 50-year-old adult, except that a 50-year-old would have a three-year statute of limitations and a minor would have 20 years from the time that they turn 21.

50
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You're correct.

51
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.500
It could apply to anybody.

52
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:48.000
The biggest issue that we're seeing, and if we need to tweak the legislation a little bit, I want to aim this toward the minors because I don't believe minors have the ability to consent.

53
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:03.000
They don't have the ability to consent legally to buy a car, to do a bunch of other things, take out a loan, much less have potentially a life-altering surgery.

54
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So I want to focus on that narrow group more so than anybody else.

55
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.500
So if we need to tweak the language, I'm with you.

56
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.000
This extends the time period for minors.

57
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
The three years exist today, effectively.

58
00:10:22.000 --> 00:11:50.500
Someone who chose to transition as an adult and then detransition could be could sue under today's laws at least the adult has the ability to make an informed and decision and actually consent the minors don't have that option i don't believe they they can consent at all legally and it's hard to make an informed decision when you're when you're just at i don't know 14 15 16 the ability to make to fully understand and grasp the long-term ramifications of these type decisions yeah follow-up sure so i guess my other question is is that let's say that you were 22 at the time then this bill would apply to say that you would have three years from the time so at that point you'd be 24 why isn't it three years from the time you turn 21 why is it 20 years why is it a different standard for one group and another standard for i interpreted the 20 years um okay the three years exist today this was an extension of 20.

59
00:11:50.500 --> 00:12:38.000
I was trying to get to the late 30s we could say we're on page two line 10 where it says 21 we could make that 18 instead of 21 there which would bring the final age to 38 which was my intent and it's really about the minors who start right who start transition a lot of this transition surgery isn't happening in your 20s a lot of this is happening prior to 20 during the development phase other representative horick i'll make this quick this is more of a would you believe question.

60
00:12:38.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You seem to say that it's just a very new phenomenon for women in their late 30s to give birth, but would you believe that, and this is not an isolated example, that for example my maternal grandmother gave birth to my mother when she was 42, and that was in 1931, so women in their 40s giving birth is is would you believe that's not a new phenomenon and the cutoff date which i mean i'm not sure if i agree with this bill at all but the cutoff date obviously the late 30s is probably younger than when women stop having babies so thank you representative horgan yes i believe that women have children well into their 40s.

61
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The current data shows that there is a growing trend where the first child happens in the mid to late 30s, which is the part I'm talking about.

62
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.000
You don't find out that you're sterile until you start trying to have kids.

63
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:45.500
And if you don't start trying to have kids until you're mid 30s and it takes a year or two or three to figure out that there's issues, that's why this bill allows for that extended period of time and yes families continue to have children well into their 40s so thank you other questions for this witness yes representative turr yeah thanks and thanks for taking the question um might be a two-part question i as i'm reading this um we're adding this to essentially the claims for what amounts to malpractice.

64
00:14:45.500 --> 00:15:05.500
The issue, as I'm understanding what you're saying, is really not that any sort of standard of care or the current rules regarding consent being properly given, which is what's embodied here in paragraph three, which is the existing rules.

65
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:14.000
I'm not hearing anything in here that says that any of those things were actually structurally violated.

66
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:33.500
So we're basically, it sounds like opening the door to having, you know, liability malpractice cases brought, even though all of the rules and standards of care were followed that were in place at the time that that happened.

67
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.000
Is that an accurate reading?

68
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
No, it's not.

69
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.500
So a minor can't consent.

70
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:50.500
Let's all acknowledge in this room that 18 is the age that we as society have determined that Thank you.

71
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.500
No, it's not.

72
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.000
So a minor can't consent.

73
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Let's all acknowledge in this room that 18 is the age that we as society have determined that a minor can consent to something.

74
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So what we're talking about in this case, and this is relatively to Representative Katab's question on line 10, page 2, 21 versus 18.

75
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
It should be 18.

76
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Okay.

77
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:32.500
A minor who is trying to go through this is not signing the paperwork, does not have the insurance.

78
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.500
Okay.

79
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.000
That's allowing for this surgery.

80
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.500
This is happening around them.

81
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.500
Now it may be done in a very supportive way.

82
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.500
That's fine.

83
00:16:46.500 --> 00:17:34.000
But when the minor becomes an adult years later and finds out harm happened, unintended consequences because they've they've chosen to undo some of this they that's when it triggers that they can they can have access to a liability claim all up yeah one so one follow-up and and again i'm crossing over into another bill before us a little bit um to ask this we heard a bill that was your bill last year last week sorry um you know CROSSING OVER INTO ANOTHER BILL BEFORE US A LITTLE BIT TO ASK THIS.

84
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:56.500
WE HEARD A BILL THAT WAS YOUR BILL LAST YEAR, LAST WEEK, SORRY, YOU KNOW, WHICH I BELIEVE IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF A MINOR BEING GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION AT ITS HEART BUT THEN SORT OF EXPANDED INTO THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION QUESTIONS.

85
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:07.000
DOES THAT SAME THOUGHT NOT APPLY TO B, are you, are you, am I being clear about what I'm asking here?

86
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
No, you're not.

87
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Cause the last bill I was in here had to do with qualified immunity, which was a completely different domain than this.

88
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So I'm not sure what bill you're referencing, but I'll gladly take your question.

89
00:18:27.000 --> 00:19:02.000
If you can get me to a bill number or a title that, that, that it, correct bill and my understanding um is that the underlying concept behind that had to do do with prescription or at its at its outset prescription medication no no the qualified immunity has to do with if a state actor okay chooses to pursue a case in my case we, we had provided medication.

90
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:15.000
That was the example I used, but the state act, the qualified immunity had to do with the state actor pursuing a case beyond imminent danger.

91
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Imminent danger is measured in minutes, hours, might even be days, but it's definitely not weeks or months.

92
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Okay.

93
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.500
Qualified immunity has to do with the state interfering and acting.

94
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.500
In this case, what we're talking about is completely different.

95
00:19:36.500 --> 00:20:33.000
We're talking about a person who cannot make an informed decision, who cannot legally consent, who then takes and does something or something is done to them, who then finds out years later, there are unintended unintended consequences i don't think there's anybody in this room who wants to sterilize children if you do please raise your hand i'd love to see that group but i don't believe anybody in this room wants to see children sterilized unfortunately that is the net effect of some of these surgeries and i have real concerns i believe we as the adults in the room need to do our best to protect these children from this.

96
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Representative Smith.

97
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Thank you.

98
00:20:37.000 --> 00:21:03.500
Representative, if the physician filed appropriate procedures to do whatever the physician did, and no one's saying that the physician didn't i don't understand why you are suggesting going after the physician rather than after the parent who um okay was who supported uh had to have supported whatever the procedure was it.

99
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.500
Okay.

100
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:13.000
Who supported, not to have supported, whatever the procedure was that gets you upset here.

101
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
That's a great question.

102
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Thank you.

103
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.500
So, I'm going to put.

104
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:29.000
You know, when people say it's a great question, I don't ever know if they mean it or not.

105
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
No, I do.

106
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
No, legitimately, it's a great question.

107
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.500
Why the provider versus the parent is the question.

108
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:51.500
So let's put yourselves in the shoes of a parent who has a child who's a little bit confused right now about what their gender is.

109
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.000
They like hanging out, right?

110
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I have one girl, three boys.

111
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.500
I'm going to take my daughter, for example, right?

112
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:16.500
She hangs out with her brothers and realizes, you know, being a boy is fun, climbing in the woods, running through the woods, whatever, climbing trees, playing with the dog.

113
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.000
Maybe I am a boy.

114
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.500
That's not what she's decided.

115
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:29.500
But for a hypothetical, you have a loving parent who wants to do the best thing.

116
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:36.000
They're not going to be a medical expert about things like unintended consequences.

117
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:49.000
They're not going to be a medical expert about hormones and the net effect of growth of organs relative to hormones, how many hormones are needed.

118
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
They're not going to read the medical journals.

119
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.500
Who's reading the medical journals?

120
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500
Presumably the provider.

121
00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500
Who's studying this?

122
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.500
Presumably the provider.

123
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.000
Who has the professional expertise?

124
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Presumably the provider.

125
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So in this case, the person who's most knowledgeable in that room that's having this discussion isn't the child or the parent.

126
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
It is the provider.

127
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So that's why I think the provider is a better person to hold accountable than the parent, because the parent is trying to love their children.

128
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:52.000
They're hearing all these things about this might save them from a potential suicide attempt, or it might this gender-affirming care might be the right thing to do, but they don't have any expertise that they bring to the table.

129
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
They're relying on the medical professionals as well.

130
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.500
So that's why I think the provider is more liable than the parent.

131
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.000
Other questions for this witness?

132
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Representative DiLorenzo, yes.

133
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Thank you for taking my question.

134
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
So what if the child is in an emancipated minor?

135
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.500
Would they be eligible for legal remedies?

136
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.500
I'm not sure what happens to get an emancipated minor.

137
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500
Do they have full legal rights?

138
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.500
That I don't know.

139
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:36.000
I'll leave that up to someone who's in this room who might know that better.

140
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:59.000
maybe the chairman of the committee would know what what rights an emancipated minor has i i can't speak to that may i follow up of course yes certainly now is um medical transitioning is that legal in new hampshire i don't know of any prohibitions.

141
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Thank you.

142
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.500
Other questions for this witness?

143
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.000
So I guess I do have just one question.

144
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I want to sort of follow up on Representative Smith and Representative Turr's questions.

145
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.500
I want to make sure I understand.

146
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:33.000
Let's suppose in a hypothetical situation that a parent decides that, you know, whether the parent decides that it's okay for their child to have, let's say, transgender surgery.

147
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
You know, a child under 18.

148
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
And the doctor advises the parents of, you know, every risk under the sun.

149
00:25:43.000 --> 00:26:22.000
You you understand your daughter or maybe it's a son they will not be able to have children you understand that there you understand that there's a risk of x y everything under the sun they advise them and the parents say yep i agree so now the surgery is done yep is it your view that and the sir and let's assume also that that it's legal in those circumstances for the doctor to do the surgery.

150
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Yep.

151
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:40.500
Is it your view that there is still a cause that the child can say after the child turns 21, I don't care what my parent did, I didn't know all the risks.

152
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.000
And so, doctor, you're liable.

153
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.500
So that's a great example.

154
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:52.000
And I think this allows for this to go through a court case.

155
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And the court case, the doctor can say, look, I have this signed form.

156
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.500
I asked them to read.

157
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.500
We read through this document verbatim.

158
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:11.000
It said, line one, that you risk your child being sterile for life.

159
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.500
And the person initialed right after that.

160
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:22.000
And then we went down and I went through this step by step with them.

161
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And the parents still insisted, judge, I am not liable.

162
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I gave them the best information I had available at the time.

163
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.500
And the parent chose to proceed anyway.

164
00:27:36.500 --> 00:28:14.000
Your honor, I didn't, I didn didn't cause this i didn't sign this paperwork that said yes proceed i gave them all the information necessary for them to say no i encouraged them to say no and they still proceeded anyway okay and so i'm sorry i guess i'm so what happens then the judge so that that so the judge could reject that and say well you might have that, but your child didn't.

165
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:40.500
Well, no, but what I'm saying is the judge will have that sounds like a great defense in a medical malpractice suit, especially if it's been documented as thoroughly as you've just mentioned, where the judge can look and say, yes, it's clear that this doctor did what he could to prevent this.

166
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.000
And the parents did insisted that this go forward.

167
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:54.500
I think that's a great case, and that ends the case, presuming the judge is making a balanced decision.

168
00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:20.000
I guess what I'm wondering is if that isn't, rather than sort of expose the doctor to the potential of a lawsuit, isn't what you really want to prevent is you want to prevent people that are minors from being able to consent or for the parents being able to consent.

169
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Isn't that really what you're asking?

170
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
But that's a prohibition.

171
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
It says that.

172
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
So that's a prohibition.

173
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:36.000
And I said earlier in my testimony, I'm not in favor of strict prohibitions.

174
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.500
I try and tend to avoid that.

175
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.500
I don't know that that's a proper role of government.

176
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:51.500
In this case, I believe there is real harm for some of these minors.

177
00:29:51.500 --> 00:30:06.000
But I believe the best way to address it is to level the playing field between the patient and the provider, because the provider knows some of these things.

178
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:20.000
If the provider is aware that there's going to be long-term consequences, the provider will be highly incentivized to make sure the parents know this before they proceed.

179
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.500
Back to the example of what you just asked.

180
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:29.000
The doctor can say, you know, there's real harm.

181
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:40.500
You understand as soon as we start taking, as soon as I start providing these puberty blockers, they're gonna have less less estrogen.

182
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:52.000
There is a chance their ovaries and their fallopian tubes aren't going to develop correctly or their uterus isn't going to develop correctly.

183
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And then they're going to have long-term pain.

184
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:14.500
Are you okay that if we start giving this medication to your daughter because they don't want to be a daughter anymore, they want to be a young boy, that there's going to be some unintended consequences.

185
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.500
I think the doctors are the perfect people to have that conversation.

186
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:32.000
I think they are more than often more informed than anybody else in the room, and I want them to have that conversation.

187
00:31:32.000 --> 00:32:21.500
The best way to do it is to level the playing field between the patient and provider, because right now, if a minor 14-year-old this hits 18 guess what time limits up they're done that's where the problem is let's solve that problem all right other questions for this witness yes representative perez thank you i have two quick questions number one i have two quick questions number one are you aware that there are many law cases going on right now all over the United States where young people who transition are now suing medical companies and doctors?

188
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.500
I am not aware.

189
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:29.000
It would not surprise me for that statement to be true.

190
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.500
And I say that because this is kind of experimental surgery and treatment.

191
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.500
And some countries have started to ban it.

192
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.000
Some states have started to ban it.

193
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
As I said earlier in my testimony, I'm not thrilled with just straight prohibitions.

194
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.500
I don't like that approach.

195
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.500
I don't think that works for many things.

196
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:06.000
So a better solution is to allow for the legal system to help determine whether harm was actually done.

197
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
This doesn't guarantee a win against the provider.

198
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.000
It just allows for the potential for the patient to address the unintended consequences that happened.

199
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.500
One such case is the Chloe Cole case that we're all aware of Chloe Cole.

200
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:45.500
Also, as far as emancipated minors are concerned, are you aware that they have rights of an adult except for things like they can't buy alcohol, they can't vote, they can't quit school if they're under the age of 16.

201
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:52.500
So emancipated minors, are you aware that there are limitations for them as well?

202
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.500
Thank you.

203
00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:06.500
I actually have, I believe you, I have never studied, I have never studied what the, what an emancipated minor can and cannot do.

204
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.000
So I can't make, I can't speak to that.

205
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:23.000
I do know as a society, we've determined that 18 is the magic age by which someone transitions from a minor to an adult.

206
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
All right.

207
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.500
Other questions for this witness?

208
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.500
Representative Manos.

209
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.500
Thank you, Mr.

210
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.500
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

211
00:34:35.500 --> 00:35:10.000
You gave the example earlier of your friend who had, I think you said it was kidney surgery and some wrapping was left behind and I can understand that as perhaps traditional medical malpractice but your section on page 2 number 2 new section medical injury actions and you add what appears to me to be new claims defined as medical malpractice that are not traditionally viewed that way.

212
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And I wondered if you could address that and they seem I just wanted to also add they seem to be what are called per se claims that you don't have to actually prove the injury but if these occurred it would per se be medical malpractice and i wondered if you could address that also thank you so in section two um let me first i'll answer your question it was um um her surgery.

213
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:57.000
One of the treatments for hernia surgery is to put in a mesh to reinforce the lower abdomen.

214
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.500
Unfortunately, there's been, I'm not even sure if it might be class action suits at this point.

215
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:17.000
I know there are a number of suits relative to the unintended scarring due to use of an artificial mesh for hernia surgery..

216
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.500
So they were told to do something.

217
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:26.000
This was the best recommendation, and unfortunately, it caused long-term consequences.

218
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
That's traditional medical malpractice.

219
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:40.000
I'm fully with you, but it wasn't like a surgery where a piece of fabric was left behind or a tool was left behind.

220
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Those are different.

221
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
This was, they did exactly what they intended to do.

222
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:59.000
The surgery went fine, but three years out, people find out that the mesh that was being used at the time had created issues.

223
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:11.000
In this case, paragraph one, starting at line six and through 10, okay, is in fact a list of particular items that are new.

224
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:53.500
line 11 through 15 is in fact something that would be if if you had surgery and someone ended up sterile because of that surgery you were going in for instance to do a hernia surgery and you ended up damaging something because of that surgery, you were going in, for instance, to do a hernia surgery, and you ended up damaging something in terms of a reproductive organ, and the person was of childbearing age and ended up scarred fallopian tubes or whatever else.

225
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.000
They did something during surgery.

226
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
That would clearly be a medical malpractice suit.

227
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:09.500
This just says if the person is infertile, that is clearly grounds for convincing evidence that harm was done.

228
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:22.000
The other is going to have to be, you're going to have to make the case for the section one that those are real harm.

229
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.500
Section two being sterile is in fact a very defined case.

230
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.000
It's either yes or no.

231
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.500
All right, other questions for this witness?

232
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

233
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500
Thank you.

234
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.500
Next, I'm going to call Beth Scar, please.

235
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.500
Or Scar, please.

236
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.000
You need to turn on the mic.

237
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
That's it.

238
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
There you go.

239
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Okay.

240
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Hi.

241
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.500
Dear committee members, I'm testifying in support of HB 1664 because my niece deserved better.

242
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:10.000
My niece's mom took her to Planned Parenthood at the age of 17.

243
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
My niece had severe ADHD and a chaotic family life.

244
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:24.500
She and her mom respected and trusted the medical professionals at Planned Parenthood to properly diagnose and treat her.

245
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:42.000
She was administered testosterone instead of getting the treatment she needed for her mental health, and this led her to spiral down into depression and opiate addiction, and she died of an overdose at 21.

246
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
I miss her terribly, and this didn't have to happen.

247
00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:07.500
And our friend Katie Anderson, who tends church with us in Nashua, was administered testosterone and had her breasts and her entire reproductive system, including her uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix removed after being misdiagnosed by medical professionals as transgender.

248
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:18.500
Now she is at much increased risk of early osteoporosis and early dementia and she has lost the ability to have children.

249
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:24.500
The medical professionals Katie trusted misdiagnosed her and she has no recourse.

250
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:42.000
Now she has to deal with a lack of standards of care and a lack of diagnosis codes to get the treatment she needs to recover her health as much as doctors are able to.

251
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:54.500
It breaks my heart to see her love and devotion for the kids at church and to know she can't have any of her own.

252
00:40:54.500 --> 00:41:09.000
Doctors are making money off these confused young people and not paying any price when these young people's brains mature and they realize it was all a horrible mistake.

253
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Vote ought to pass on HB 1664 to help hold the medical professionals accountable and give detransitioners justice.

254
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Thank you.

255
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Questions for this witness?

256
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

257
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Next, I'm going to call on Matthew Hood.

258
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Oh, sorry.

259
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.500
I wasn't sure what you were saying.

260
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.500
Proper pronunciation.

261
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.500
Thank you, Mr.

262
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.000
Chair, members of the committee.

263
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
For the record, my name is Matthew Hood, like H-O-O-D.

264
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Okay.

265
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.000
I am Vice President for Government Relations at Dartmouth Health, and I'm here in opposition to the bill.

266
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:27.500
Actually several of the points that I was going to make have been raised by members of the committee, so I will be short and reiterate those points, one of which is that we're concerned that it's a rather significant deviation from the current medical malpractice legislation, which doesn't enumerate any particular practice area, cancer care, genetics care, take your pick.

267
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:34.500
We're concerned that it's a slippery slope if you start to enumerate particular services.

268
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:42.000
If a physician or a provider performs out of the standard of care, there's liability.

269
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
If they haven't, then they shouldn't.

270
00:42:45.000 --> 00:43:54.500
What I would say, in addition to just enumerating it, is substantively, excuse me, it's a fairly significant deviation in that it extends the duration of liability from the standard three years or when discovered to 20 years this seems like a fairly long period of time second it switched the burden of proof finding harm if there's infertility which can be rebutted I don't know if it's the intent of the drafting but I'm not sure how you rebut whether someone's infertile or not so that doesn't seem like a reasonable burden of proof to switch further it leads me to the point that not only is there no violation, there be a requirement for a violation of the standard of care as raised by Representative Tourer, but we know that gender affirming care often results in infertility.

271
00:43:54.500 --> 00:44:01.500
And so you're setting up a provider for failure by having actually successful outcome.

272
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:21.000
And my other point is there seems to be a lack of recognition of parental involvement with the minor's decision in this case, so there's never a minor that's subject to procedures in this space without significant parental engagement.

273
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:35.000
And my final point is that there is in fact a bill that would prohibit transition surgery for minors, including referrals for out-of-state care that pass the House.

274
00:44:35.000 --> 00:45:06.500
So I'm not sure that this bill would be strictly necessary thank you mr chairman questions for this witness yes representative page thanks thank you mr hood for taking my question um this relates to the standard of care in the medical field and how that's arrived at or changed according to science i suppose i suppose the law could help do that.

275
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:14.500
It's probably the least efficient way to have doctors figure out how to stand up care.

276
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:30.500
But could you just, just in general, describe kind of what the medical profession does when they're looking at procedures and science and understanding what the best course of medical treatment is?

277
00:45:30.500 --> 00:46:09.000
Is there a rigorous process with that um thank you for the question I it is a substantial question for the VP of government relations to answer what the what the medical field does in that space but I will certainly attest to the fact that our providers have standards of care evidence-based practice from which the care is provided, studies over years, thousands of people who are engaged in these studies to come to a conclusion.

278
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:34.000
There's exceptions in terms of experimental studies and clinical trials, of course, but to answer your question, of course, there's a rigorous basis of science and medical practice that goes into making determinations for each clinical area, whether it's, again, OB or clinical care or cancer care, et cetera, orthopedics.

279
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.500
Other questions for this witness?

280
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.500
Representative Alexander.

281
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500
Thank you, Mr.

282
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.500
Chair.

283
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.500
Thank you for taking my question.

284
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.000
Does Dartmouth Health typically perform these surgeries?

285
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:58.500
Can you give me a little bit more detail about how often they happen and what the procedure entails?

286
00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:06.000
Can you talk to me a little bit more about what Dartmouth Health specifically does?

287
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Dartmouth Health does not provide gender transitioning surgeries for minors.

288
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:25.500
And in fact, I don't believe that they're performed in the state of New Hampshire, but I wouldn't want to speak for all of the providers in the state.

289
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.500
Follow up?

290
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:32.000
So why are you weighing in on the bill?

291
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.500
I guess I'm just wondering.

292
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:41.500
If you don't perform the surgeries, why are you weighing in on the bill?

293
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:48.500
Because we're, well, there are other provisions of the bill, hormone therapy, et cetera.

294
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:54.000
And so for that reason, we're weighing in on the bill.

295
00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And we're also significantly concerned about changing the paradigm of medical malpractice.

296
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Thank you.

297
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Yeah.

298
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.500
Other questions for this witness?

299
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.000
Seeing none, thank you very much, sir.

300
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Thank you.

301
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.500
Next, Stephen Scare, please, Scare.

302
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.500
Good morning, Chairman Lin and representatives.

303
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:24.000
I'm asking you to support this bill and hold the medical industry accountable.

304
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:34.500
No one can give informed consent if the parents are threatened with their children's suicide or if they're given false information.

305
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:39.000
My friend detransitioner, Preisha Mosley, wanted to be here.

306
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
She can't, so she sent me this testimony.

307
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Gender-affirming care, from its procedures to its results to its very name, is a fraudulent farce.

308
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Manipulative language has been carefully crafted to deceive you, but gender-denying care is not health care.

309
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.500
The goal of health care is health.

310
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:11.500
I shouldn't have been able to go to my doctors as a distressed teen and become more sick.

311
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:17.000
I deserved ethical, evidence-based care for my mental illness and trauma.

312
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:25.500
No child can consent to a health-destroying lie, even if they're sick enough to thank their abusers.

313
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:31.500
Dartmouth Health has testified that gender-affirming care is safe and well researched.

314
00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:42.500
This contradicts the findings of the systematic reviews of medical panels in Sweden, Norway, Finland, England, France, and the World Health Organization.

315
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:50.000
They made that announcement last month, and I've included the executive summaries in my testimony.

316
00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:01.500
The panels each concluded there was no sound evidence of benefits to puberty blockers and hormones, so they should be considered experimental treatments.

317
00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:10.000
They expressed concern about how these treatments affect bone health, fertility, intellectual development, and cause premature menopause.

318
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.000
They recognize that trans identities can be transient and seem to spread as a social contagion.

319
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.000
And they warn that children with mental health disorders and autism are especially vulnerable.

320
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:35.500
So why the difference between what's happening in Europe and what's happening in the US and what's happening in New Hampshire.

321
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:50.500
Our major medical associations dropped medical science and they assumed a religious model that teaches we have gendered souls or gender identities that we're born with and they don't change.

322
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.500
They're immutable.

323
00:50:52.500 --> 00:51:04.500
Any attempt to tamper with them will likely result in suicide, so it's better to try to correct the body with chemicals and scalpels.

324
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:12.000
The ideological view was the foundation of the American Academy of Pediatrics Transgender Care Policy.

325
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:20.000
It was written by one man, Jason Rafferty, who agreed to take full responsibility for it.

326
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.500
It's easy to look at.

327
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:30.000
You can pick out your phones or go onto the computer and check his footnotes.

328
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:44.000
You'll find it doesn't provide any research to substantiate his claim that helping children learn to be comfortable with their own sex body is a dangerous conversion therapy.

329
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.500
Instead, what he does, he referred to things regarding sexual orientation.

330
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:54.000
Our medical societies refuse to respond to international criticism.

331
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.500
They forbid debate at their annual conferences.

332
00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:16.500
The publications that they're affiliated support their view with a low quality research, like this 1% regret rate which keeps getting bandied about, which is about, among other problems, it's old data based on adults and their surgery.

333
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:23.000
It's not relevant to this conversation and the number of detransitioners at all.

334
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:30.000
I hope you'll pass this bill and help detransitions get the compensation they deserve.

335
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:42.500
And please keep in mind that the research that we have shows the average time it takes to feel the regret is over eight years.

336
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.500
So thank you.

337
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.500
Questions for this witness?

338
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.000
Seeing none, thank you very much, sir.

339
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Representative Alonso, I didn't see you, sorry.

340
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Thank you for taking my question.

341
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.500
So can I ask you, what do you do for work?

342
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:16.000
I am not a medical doctor, but the people I gave each of you the executive summaries that have all of the experts' testimony there.

343
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
You shouldn't trust me.

344
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
You should trust that.

345
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And I realize that some of you might be tempted because you disagree with it to put these in the trash or the recycling bin without reading them.

346
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.500
That would be consistent with what the medical industry is doing in the United States.

347
00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.000
Other questions for this witness?

348
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Representative Horrigan.

349
00:53:46.000 --> 00:54:22.500
Yes, you, I'm not sure whether that was your statement or who's the woman whose statement you read at first that's my first question what was her name then trisha something i didn't catch the name i'm sorry presha mosley trisha wensley okay fine so anyway either you or patricia wensley or both were saying uh attributing the medical you know medical professionals uh view on on trans surgery to their religious beliefs.

350
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:34.000
And I won't get in the argument whether or not you actually stated their religious beliefs accurately or whether they all share them.

351
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:46.500
But if it is religiously motivated, isn't that covered under the right to religious freedom, which is guaranteed by both the federal and state constitutions?

352
00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:52.500
No one has a First Amendment right to mutilate and sterilize children.

353
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.500
All right.

354
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.000
Other questions for this witness?

355
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.500
Seeing none, thank you very much, sir.

356
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.500
Next, I'm going to call am Shannon McGinley.

357
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:13.000
I am a volunteer executive director with Cornerstone Action, a Christian advocacy organization here in New Hampshire.

358
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
I am here to testify in support of HB 1664.

359
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:47.000
i had some previous testimony that i was planning to talk about but based on the testimony here this morning i want to hit on a few points that were actually um i felt missing from the testimony before and it also i'm referencing senator kevin avard's testimony on a very very similar bill, SB304, in the Senate.

360
00:55:47.000 --> 00:56:04.500
I just want to be clear that this bill does not create legal remedies for those who are detransitioning because under RSA 507-E, New Hampshire already has a general cause of action for medical injury.

361
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:16.500
This cause of action is open-ended and it can include any type of medical injury so long as the elements of 507-E are met.

362
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:25.000
Under our current law, there is nothing stopping a detransitioner from bringing a medical malpractice suit tomorrow.

363
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:42.500
The problem is that because this is a developing area, there's great uncertainty about how our medical injury statutes would apply in a suit by a detransitioner, especially with regard to the statute of limitations.

364
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:57.500
The goal of this bill is not to create a fundamental new cause of action, like I said before, but to give greater clarity to both detransitioners and medical professionals.

365
00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:10.000
A secondary goal of this bill is to clarify under 354-A, discriminating against someone for being a detransitioner is a form of gender identity discrimination.

366
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.500
I argue that this is already the law under the U.S.

367
00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:23.000
Supreme Court's decision in Bostock, but this bill's modification to 354-A would make that explicit.

368
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:39.500
I first want to distinguish this bill from other bills on this issue that we see around the country, like Representative Hohl said, that this is not a total ban on medical detransitioning.

369
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:49.500
Should this bill become law, a patient will not be automatically entitled to a monetary award just because they've detransitioned.

370
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:58.500
They will still have to meet the regular elements and of our existing medical injury law in 507-E.

371
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:06.000
There will simply be less ambiguity ambiguity about how that law is going to apply.

372
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Under RSA 508 colon four, New Hampshire uses what's called the discovery rule, which was mentioned before to determine when the statute of limitations starts to accrue in a medical practice action.

373
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:31.500
Currently, you must sue for medical injury in New Hampshire within three years of when you discovered the injury.

374
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:40.000
The problem is that in the case of a detransitioner, it's not clear when the discovery happened.

375
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:48.000
When detransitioner suits start to be filed in New Hampshire, they will be brought for sure.

376
00:58:48.000 --> 00:59:00.500
Whether this bill is passed or not, both parties will have to spend undue time and expense litigating the issue of when this discovery happened.

377
00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:04.500
This bill will resolve that question going forward.

378
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:18.500
If you allege that you were medically injured by a transition, that three-year timetable will start to tick when you begin to detransition and no sooner than that.

379
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:28.500
So again, detransition here means that you're receiving medical treatment to help reverse some of the effects of medical transitioning.

380
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:40.500
For example, a woman who starts taking estrogen trying to heal some of the damage to her vocal pitch from testosterone will be detransitioning.

381
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:47.000
Finally, let me just say something about the non-discrimination piece in this bill.

382
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000
In its decision in Bostock v.

383
00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:07.500
Clayton, the Supreme Court said that to determine whether there was discrimination, quote, because of, end quote, some factor, a court must ask whether there would be a different outcome if that factor was different.

384
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:22.000
For example, if you fire a male employee for identifying as a woman, the court asks whether you would have fired the employee if he identified as a man.

385
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.500
If the answer is no, then you discriminated because of gender identity under RSA 354-A.

386
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Now, what if someone is discriminated against because they are a detransitioner?

387
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:40.000
This has already happened right here in New Hampshire.

388
01:00:40.000 --> 01:01:00.000
For example, last year, a New Hampshire Holiday Inn location right here in Concord was ordered by its corporate office to cancel a planned event hosted when they learned that Chloe Cole, a detransitioner, was the speaker at the event.

389
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The Holiday Inn shut down Cole's event because while Cole used to identify as a man, she now identifies as a woman.

390
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.500
If she pursued a claim under our laws, this would be a violation of 354-A.

391
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:31.000
That's because if Chloe Cole still identified as a man today, there would not have been a so-called controversy and she would face no discrimination.

392
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:40.000
This example shows that discrimination because of someone is a detransitioner simply is discrimination because of gender identity.

393
01:01:40.000 --> 01:02:06.000
In closing, while I believe that this is a common sense application of current law, I hope that making this explicit in RSA 354-A will help to deter unlawful discrimination in New Hampshire and encourage detransitioners to vindicate their rights as full and equal members of our society under our state laws.

394
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Thank you.

395
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I'll take any questions if you have them.

396
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Questions for this witness.

397
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Representative Alexander.

398
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Thank you, Mr.

399
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Chair.

400
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Thank you for taking my question.

401
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.500
I'm looking at page two lines six through ten.

402
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:34.500
There's a previous question about the age that the person may bring such action.

403
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.000
Why is it 21 and not 18?

404
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.500
Do you think it should be, do you think the clock should start at 18?

405
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:53.500
honestly I think that lines 6 through 10 are a bit confusing in this particular bill.

406
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:58.000
The Senate version does not have that particular section.

407
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:07.500
And I think that the rest of the bill is very straightforward and that enters in some complicated language.

408
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:14.500
I think that the committee could have a conversation about perhaps removing that section.

409
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:27.500
I believe that the bill overall is totally solid because it doesn't change anything under current state law as it relates to a cause of action.

410
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.000
Other questions for this witness?

411
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Mr.

412
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Kue.

413
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Yes, Representative.

414
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Thank you.

415
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Thank you for taking my question.

416
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yes, ma'am.

417
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:54.000
As regards to line 13 on page 2, there's a definition of medical care provider that seems to be really, really extensive.

418
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.500
It's almost as if anyone, any employee who stepped into that hospital or medical place is viable.

419
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
I'm sorry.

420
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:11.000
I just want to clarify the line that you're looking at, Representative DeLorenzo.

421
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.500
You're looking at page two.

422
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.500
You said line 13?

423
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.500
Yes.

424
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.500
Medical care provider.

425
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.500
That's Roman two, medical care provider.

426
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500
I'm sorry.

427
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
I'm sorry.

428
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.500
I'm not seeing it.

429
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.500
That's page one.

430
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.500
Sorry.

431
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500
Okay.

432
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.500
That's current law.

433
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.500
I was just getting ready to say it.

434
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.500
I'm sorry.

435
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:46.500
That's just the current law of the definition.

436
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.500
Okay.

437
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Okay.

438
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.500
Sorry.

439
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.000
I was just trying to track it.

440
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.500
Other questions for this witness?

441
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:13.000
So I guess I have one, and I'm not quite, I mean, I think you're generally correct that this bill doesn't make really very many changes to existing law.

442
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.500
And so I guess one question is, if that's true, why do we need it?

443
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.000
But more importantly, the question I have is this.

444
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:51.500
The one area where it seems to me that it does make a difference is the statute of limitations because under current law, under the discovery rule, a minor would have three years from the time they discovered or reasonably should have discovered the injury and its causal relationship to the actor's conduct.

445
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.000
This would extend that to 20 years.

446
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.500
Why for this particular kind of injury should it be 20 years as opposed to three years?

447
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:17.500
Well, that kind of goes back to the response that I had to Representative Alexander, that that section of line six through 10 definitely, I think, complicates it.

448
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:32.000
And that's why I would suggest that the committee consider to remove that, because I think it's fair to stay consistent with current state law being the three years.

449
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
This bill, the reason why it's needed, Mr.

450
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:53.500
Chairman, is because we need to clarify when the clock ticks, like I said in my testimony, because this is such an unknown area of law that it's unclear when the clock begins to tick.

451
01:06:53.500 --> 01:07:05.000
So this way, we're not wasting time in the courts trying to determine that statute of limitations and when that clock kicked in.

452
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:22.500
And so what it means is that at the time that the person starts to detransition, like the example that I gave about taking the estrogen, et cetera, that that's when the clock would tick.

453
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:27.500
But you know, I guess, where does it say that?

454
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.500
I know you said that before.

455
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:34.000
I don't see that in the bill.

456
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.500
Where does it say that the clock starts when you start to detransition?

457
01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.000
Sorry, I'm just flipping through this to make sure.

458
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Sure.

459
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Representative Hool?

460
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Yes.

461
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.500
That doesn't say when the clock starts.

462
01:07:54.500 --> 01:08:01.500
That doesn't say, that doesn't have anything to do with when the clock starts.

463
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:15.500
No, it says that the detransition means that the treatment received by an individual for the purpose of reversing or mitigating the effects of the gender transition surgery.

464
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:20.000
So it's referring, it's defining what medical detransition means.

465
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Right.

466
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.500
Where does that, how does that say that, how does that say that's when the clock starts?

467
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:53.000
In fact, actually, that would, that would, I mean, I don't think it says it in either case, but if anything, it would seem to suggest that that would say when the clock starts, if someone were bringing an action for negligence in the D-transitioning.

468
01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:05.500
so that if someone were saying, you know, you started to give me some anti-transitioning medication or treatment or whatever, and you did that negligently.

469
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:27.000
And now that's when, I mean, first of all, I don't think it says anything about when the clock starts, but that definition of what constitutes detransitioning, how is that relevant to whether there was some negligence in the original treatment to transition?

470
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.500
I just don't see it.

471
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:44.500
I'm going to have to read it again, and I'm going to have to look at the statute there that's referenced, and then I'll get back to you on that.

472
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500
That's fine.

473
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.000
Other questions for this witness?

474
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Thank you very much.

475
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Thank you.

476
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Ava Hawks, please.

477
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Good morning, Mr.

478
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.500
Chair, members of the committee.

479
01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:12.000
For the record, my name is A Hawks and I am the director of advocacy for the New Hampshire Medical Society on my pin card.

480
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I did list that I had copies of my testimony and as it is a Wednesday morning, I printed a different bell.

481
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:30.500
So I'm happy I'm limiting my remarks based on how far we are on time.

482
01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:45.500
And also a lot of this arguments that were going to be made in my testimony were articulated through some of the questions raised by committee members, particularly the chairman.

483
01:10:45.500 --> 01:11:13.000
So the Medical Society is opposed to House Bill 1664 as we have concerns that this would unjustly put our state's gender-affirming care providers in a uniquely difficult position as the bill would target this specific provision of health care and create a carve-out in the RSA that's being referenced and invoked in this bill.

484
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And it would target the specific provision of this care by dramatically increasing the potential medical malpractice liability for doctors who provide such care.

485
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
The Medical Society is not alone in opposing legislation such as this.

486
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:44.500
We stand alongside the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, alongside our local New Hampshire chapters as well oppose this policy.

487
01:11:44.500 --> 01:12:03.000
In efforts to safeguard the provision of gender-affirming care around the country, and here in New Hampshire, we would continue to oppose efforts that would dissuade our providers from providing this care out of fear of litigation.

488
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.500
And I will leave it at that.

489
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.500
I'm happy to take any questions.

490
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500
Thank you so much.

491
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500
Questions for this witness.

492
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Representative Perez.

493
01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.500
Thank you.

494
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.000
Thanks for taking my question.

495
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Of course.

496
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Are physicians that give gender-affirming care subject at this time to malpractice?

497
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I don't want to ask a question to a question malpractice for the provision of gender affirming care.

498
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:48.000
If I'm a doctor and I give whatever or perform surgery or give hormones or anything am I liable for a malpractice?

499
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.500
Am I can I someone file a malpractice suit against me?

500
01:12:53.500 --> 01:13:15.000
So, while I wish I was one, I am not a lawyer, but what I do know is if a patient feels that they have suffered a medical injury, current state law already affords them the opportunity to seek damages from a provider.

501
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I know, and the reason I reference that is I know we shouldn't invoke other pieces of legislation but a prior testifier did so I will say there's a similar bill with similar legislation and the New Hampshire Association for Justice testified to that point that under current state law if there is any medical injury folks already have recourse.

502
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
All right other follow-up.

503
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yep follow follow up.

504
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:59.500
So if I'm a doctor performing transitioning or giving hormones, I'm liable for malpractice, is if I assume we're assuming, correct?

505
01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:04.000
I don't know if I can agree with that.

506
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.500
I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know exactly how I would answer that question.

507
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:24.500
You know if there is a medical, I'm not here to argue whether or not the provision of gender affirming care and the range of care.

508
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:31.500
I feel like the question's insinuating that there's medical injury associated to that care.

509
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.500
Okay.

510
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.500
Okay.

511
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.500
Sorry.

512
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.000
I must be misunderstanding then.

513
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:56.000
No, I just, if you're liable when you perform it, why wouldn't somebody who's transitioning, the doctor also be liable for that, I guess was the point I was trying to get.

514
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Thank you.

515
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.500
All right, other questions for this witness?

516
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:04.500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

517
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.500
Molly Brennan, please.

518
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:34.000
you hey everyone good morning uh molly brennan where i'd like to um speak in opposition to this bill um my i'm gonna speak uh anecdotally over and over again with all of these trans eradication bills that I've sat in in the House and Senate since I moved back to New Hampshire from Chicago.

519
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:53.500
I hear all of these experts talk about the benefits of gender affirmation care and how much more beneficial they are and how small the margin is of people who are injured and who make a choice to detransition.

520
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.500
So we've heard all of that.

521
01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:02.500
And what I'd like to actually provide today is some anecdotal experience.

522
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:11.000
I was in Chicago for 30 years and I ran a community space that centered transgender artists.

523
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.500
I had hundreds of transgender artists in my backyard and in my home.

524
01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:24.000
The problem that they had was not that they had been medically injured.

525
01:16:24.000 --> 01:17:20.500
In fact, the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the makes it sound like it's like a vending machine and you go up and you get your estrogen, you get your testosterone you get your surgery and it's not like that even in illinois which has some of the most liberal laws about this there's a huge process that you have to go through to get any of this as an adult and certainly as a child as well and the struggle is about people accepting them, their families, their classmates, their co-workers.

526
01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.500
This is the struggle, all right?

527
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.500
That is where the injury happens.

528
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:33.000
It isn't largely by the numbers because of the care that they receive.

529
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.500
And I feel for detransitioners as well.

530
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:50.000
And mostly I feel for them because they are carrying now physical or vocal characteristics that people are going to clock them as being queer and wrong.

531
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.500
And that is the thing to address is how are we treating everyone?

532
01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:06.000
And how are all of these bills that are, again, the agenda is to get rid of trans people.

533
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It is not compassionate.

534
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It is not kind.

535
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
It is not caring for children.

536
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It is to eradicate trans people.

537
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.500
And I know a lot of them.

538
01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.500
They're real.

539
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.000
They are who they say they are.

540
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And it is hard to get this care.

541
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And you are told about the sterility and you are given options about that.

542
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
You can get your ovum saved.

543
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You can get your sperm saved.

544
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.500
So that if you want to have children in the future, that is a possibility.

545
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.500
There's just a lot of mythology that's happening.

546
01:18:53.500 --> 01:19:13.000
And I don't know if you're interested in asking me some questions, but I literally have had hundreds of trans people in my life, and I may be able to shed some light on the real experience of this.

547
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Thank you.

548
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Questions for this witness?

549
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Seeing none?

550
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
All right.

551
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Thank you very much is there anyone i don't have any other pink cards on this bill is there anyone else who wishes to be heard on house bill 1664.

553
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That's fine.

554
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.500
They're a little bit busier than us, believe it or not.

555
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500
No, that's fine.

556
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500

558
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And when I am in my district and I see people from my district, I generally ask them questions like, do you have any comments, concerns, questions, criticisms?

559
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Is there anything that the government, is there any way the government is keeping you from doing your job, regulations or whatever?

560
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And that's kind of a standard.

561
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:11.500
And I was talking with a waitress that I often would have at a place in town that I eat sometimes.

562
01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.000
And she said, yes, actually.

563
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Her, I do not remember exactly the relative, whether it was grandson or nephew, but had gotten involved with drugs.

564
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And he had gone through rehab and he came out and the family wanted to have him live with them so that they could support him and keep him out of drugs and keep him clean.

565
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.500
But they lived in Section 8 housing.

566
01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:59.500
And they were told that if, because he had been involved in drugs, they were told that if he came to live there, they would be kicked out.

567
01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:07.500
So here you have a family who has to decide between their family and their home.

568
01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.500
And I said, you're right, that isn't reasonable.

569
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:38.500
Because A, we want families to stay together in where they are, and B, we want people who are trying to get clean from drugs to be able to do that and have the support they need so that's why I put this bill in questions for this witness representative Stapleton thank you mr.

570
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:57.500
chair and thank you for taking my question relative to section 8 how does you know making allowance for the recovery of the drug use affect the federal statute and monies that come forth out of Section 8?

571
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.500
Is it positive, negative, any restrictions?

572
01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:05.500
I am not sure because this is, I know education.

573
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.000
I don't actually know this.

574
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.500
I was just trying to do what I could.

575
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.500
And yeah.

576
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:19.000
So I mean, well, first, are there other questions?

577
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:30.500
So I think Representative Stapleton's question is really, I mean, I don't think that this is federal law, but I'm certainly not sure.

578
01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:56.000
If federal law were to say if you're a drug user, you can't be in Section 8 housing, whether you're the primary tenant or a relative or whatever, I think it might be hard for us to say to pass this bill because it would be in conflict with federal law.

579
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:20.500
On the other hand, if, as may be the case, federal law simply says you don't have to have, you know, you don't have to allow someone to be a tenant that if they're a drug dealer or a drug user, I should say, then this may be okay.

580
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:25.000
And I don't know the answer to that question.

581
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
It may be that the next witness does, and we'll find out.

582
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
So thank you for considering it.

583
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And, yes, the researcher when I went to do this also didn't know the answer to that question.

584
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:52.500
So we said let's just go ahead and put it in and maybe somebody will know because they didn't.

585
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.500
Thank you very much.

586
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.500
Thank you.

587
01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.500
Are there any other questions for Representative Durr?

588
01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:17.500
Yeah, and maybe this is related because my one note when I was reading this is where the definition, right, the sort of analysis of completing a substance use disorder treatment rehab program is.

589
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:48.000
and it sounds like it might be the inverse of some clause that's in section 8 um regulation that says that folks that are are in some way involved in substance use are prohibited is that is that kind of how that reads I'm just wondering whether this needs to be clarified to make it clear what situation this is exempting.

590
01:25:48.000 --> 01:26:10.500
The situation it's exempting is when the drug rehab is done, as opposed to somebody who's actively involved, and that if the person became actively involved, they would be kicked out, but the other people, the rest of the family would not be kicked out.

591
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.000
Yeah, just a quick follow.

592
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I guess what I was really wondering is do we need to reference somehow that provision somehow to make it clear what this rule is exempting?

593
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.500
And do you know where that's defined?

594
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500
That I don't.

595
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.500
I'm sorry.

596
01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.500
Representative DeLorenza.

597
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.500
Representative DeLorenza.

598
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.000
Thank you thank you Mr.

599
01:26:40.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Chair thank you for taking my question um when you mentioned section 8 housing you mentioned the bill mentions public housing was this actually public housing or was it about your program I believe she just said public housing and the Section 8 ended up being written in.

600
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000
It was just so I'm not.

601
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Yes, I.

602
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.500
I don't know what all of those titles are.

603
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.500
Like I said, I know education.

604
01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500
I don't know this.

605
01:27:18.500 --> 01:28:13.500
I'm hoping that you do and you can figure out how to deal with the situation that I came across okay okay so there are two types of section 8 housing one is public housing mm-hmm the other section 8 vouchers which are traveling vouchers so go it was she said public housing okay do you know what that's the so no it was she said public housing okay do you know what city she lives in Hudson does that has it does Hudson have a public housing authority development I don't know that we do we do have we do have um in a variety of places we have.

606
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.500
Oh, actually, no, the waitress lives in Hudson.

607
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:22.000
I do not know what town her family lives.

608
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
No, thank you.

609
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Sorry.

610
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I'm sorry.

611
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Did you have another follow up?

612
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Well, yes, I was in touch with HUD yesterday and talked with them about the bill.

613
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:56.500
And they said essentially that according to Section 8, a person who has gone to rehab and shows that they successfully finished rehab, they could be considered to become a family member of the household.

614
01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500
Do you understand?

615
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:05.500
Yes, I do, and that's interesting because that's not what the family was told.

616
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:12.000
The family was told they had to leave if they took him in.

617
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Sure.

618
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:41.500
So I'm not know i don't know that the entire situation there may be more to the story but um i don't think passing a bill like this would change anything because it's already in the hard regulations that a person can um be allowed to live in the place if they've gone through rehab.

619
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:46.000
But there are a lot of very extenuating circumstances.

620
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:55.500
But that's cool to know because then I mean we didn't find that when we were researching the bill.

621
01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.500
Sure.

622
01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:06.500
But if that is the case, that's awesome because then I can go back and tell her that.

623
01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.500
Okay.

624
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:22.500
And then there's a difference between being a drug user or being a person who is selling drugs or someone who has a meth lab in a property.

625
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:26.000
So there are a lot of variations.

626
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Yeah, no, this was somebody who had finished, completed his rehab, and they wanted to take him in to keep him clean.

627
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
So as a property manager, that's my background.

628
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I've had cases like that and we would have the person mitigate, you know, the circumstances.

629
01:30:49.000 --> 01:32:11.500
For instance, you know, okay, we had a guy, he was in prison for so many years and he left prison and no actually while he was in prison he completed a lot of training programs he had tons of certificates um he left prison and he was looking for housing and no one would take him well we took him in we first we screened him we asked him you know he came in with a binder full of certificates a binder like that full of certificates of programs that he that he achieved and everything and um we ended up letting him in letting him move in and he was a fabulous tenant i will tell you so there are success stories and oh i i know of success stories that's why i was so disturbed that this one was the opposite sure and if you like, you know, like after this hearing, you and I can talk and I can show you.

630
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.500
That'd be great.

631
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.500
Yes.

632
01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500
Okay.

633
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:25.000
Then I can take that to her and she can give it to her family.

634
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
All right.

635
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Thank you.

636
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Thank you very much.

637
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
You had a question.

638
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
So it's more of a comment.

639
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I did, I did end up finding the, would you believe that the, that the federal statute actually states that the person can be allowed to live there?

640
01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:16.000
However, if they relapse while they're a member of the household, then the entire household could be terminated because it's, if any member is determined to be illegal using drugs or whose illegal drug or alcohol abuse is determined to be a threat to others that the entire household could be terminated.

641
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.500
And is that a could or shall?

642
01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:23.000
That is a could under 42 U.S.C.

643
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
13662A.

644
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:31.500
So then this law would not necessarily contradict that because that's a could.

645
01:33:31.500 --> 01:35:15.000
and we could say, well, in our our state we don't evict the family we just evict the person right is that correct yeah I mean I I want to look at it a little more carefully but that may be you might be right you may be right well it says that they shall establish standards for it though right but that those standards could include that you could include but you have to establish standards yeah so and then just follow up when i spoke with the president had exactly an email when he looked at the bill and he said that the bill is more restrictive than what HUD has on its books so this bill is more restrictive than what's on the books for HUD okay cool so I'd be happy to work with you and to work with anybody else and make this so that it does what what i'm hoping it will do without harming anybody else well rather than go directly to me they could also go to legal services all right other other questions anybody else have any questions for this witness thank you very much thank you thank you next i'm going to call on Josh Meehan, please.

646
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Thank you.

647
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Good morning.

648
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.500
My name is Josh Meehan.

649
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:34.000
I'm the Executive Director of Keene Housing, the City of Keene's Public Housing Authority, and Chair of the New Hampshire Housing Authority Corporation's Legislative Committee.

650
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:53.000
I'm speaking in opposition to House Bill 1672, which, if enacted as drafted, would throw the state's affordable housing programs and the private, public, and nonprofit organizations participating in them into disarray and considerable legal and financial jeopardy.

651
01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:36.500
First, despite amending RSA 203, which applies to public housing authorities, the bill would regulate almost every federally assisted housing program in New Hampshire, including housing owned and managed by private and nonprofit owners specific specifically the bill states in Roman numeral 4 quote in the operation or management of section 8 rental assistance or other public housing assistance by including section 8 rental assistance in its language the bill unambiguously applies to all types of housing covered by Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937.

652
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:51.000
This includes properties in the project based rental assistance or PBRA program, which are typically owned by private or non-profit owners and not by public housing authorities or PHAs.

653
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:58.500
PHAs are not involved in approving or disapproving tenancies in the PBRA program at all.

654
01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:06.000
This language would also apply to individual property owners renting to Section 8 voucher holders.

655
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.500
So it raises the question, which federal housing programs does the bill intend to regulate?

656
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:58.500
The bill title is, quote, an act relative to tenants in Section 8 public housing but there is no such housing program section 8 of the housing act of 37 includes the housing choice voucher also known as the section 8 voucher and pbra programs but not public housing public housing falls under section 9 of the 37 act if the bill's reference to section 8 is accidental and it intends to apply only to public housing which which I'm not sure we heard from the bill's author just now.

657
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.500
It's still a little bit unclear.

658
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500
One must ask why.

659
01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:21.500
Public housing accounts are just a portion of the federally assisted affordable units in New Hampshire, whereas combined, the Section 8 voucher and PBRA programs account for the largest share of affordable housing in the state.

660
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:41.500
Nonetheless, unless otherwise indicated, the rest of my comments will assume that the bill intends, as it's drafted, to effect eligibility screening in both Section 8 and Section 9, so all the voucher program, PBRA, as well as public housing.

661
01:38:41.500 --> 01:39:12.000
If enacted, the bill would conflict with federal law pertaining to eligibility criteria in federally assisted housing programs and the chairman had asked some questions around that very issue early on federal statutes and the regular regulations derived from them prohibit PHA's housing authorities and PBRA owners from assisting certain applicants Housing Choice V voucher participants, public housing or PBRA tenants.

662
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:28.500
For example, level 3 sex offenders and anyone previously evicted from federally assisted housing for methamphetamine production are prohibited by federal law from ever participating in the Section 8 or Section 9 program.

663
01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:34.000
There are also prohibitions related to income ceilings and immigration status.

664
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:48.000
PHAs who fail to comply with these regulations are subject to HUD findings, which could result in prorated funding, more frequent program audits, or even eventually federal receivership.

665
01:39:48.000 --> 01:40:08.500
PBRA owners violating these prohibitions could lose subsidy and potentially have their housing assistance payment contracts with HUD terminated, which would result in defaults on debt service to lenders and eventually the residents being forced to find someplace else to live.

666
01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:22.000
Despite an indirect violation of federal law, the bill appears to prohibit housing providers from applying any eligibility criteria to applicants who have completed a rehabilitation program.

667
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:36.000
PHAs and PBRA owners could no longer consider criminal background, income, housing history, credit, or immigration status when screening household members who had completed a drug rehabilitation program.

668
01:40:36.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So for example, if this bill were enacted as drafted, it appears that a PHA or a PBRA owner would be breaking state law if they denied eligibility to a level three sex offender who did not have eligible immigration status, was a millionaire, and had previously been evicted from public housing for producing meth, so long as they'd completed a drug rehabilitation program.

669
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:15.500
It's also important to note that— So can I just interrupt you for a second?

670
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.500
Sure.

671
01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:23.500
So could we fix that part of it by simply saying— May.

672
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:27.500
And has not— for, you know, Section 8.

673
01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:32.500
Yeah, I think that would that would likely fix it.

674
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:42.500
I'm I'm not an attorney chairman, but I think that would fix it or change the shall to a may.

675
01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:44.500
OK, I'm sorry.

676
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.500
I didn't mean to.

677
01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.500
No, that's OK.

678
01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:53.000
I mean, this is a really, really important question.

679
01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:17.000
In particular, because if the state were to pass a law that required housing providers to violate federal law, we would have no choice but to sue for relief from the state law, since following it would expose housing providers to substantial, even existential, financial and legal risk.

680
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:26.500
Another question that is raised, though, that isn't fixed by your question, is who would enforce this new law?

681
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:33.500
The Section 8 and Section 9 programs are funded and regulated by the U.S.

682
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:36.500
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

683
01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:56.000
Except for the PBRA program, which HUD contracts with New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority to oversee on HUD's behalf, there is no state agency or regulatory body with jurisdiction over the voucher or public housing programs in the state.

684
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:07.500
If this bill were to become a law, the state would need to create a mechanism for auditing PHA and PBRA applicant files.

685
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:28.000
The state would incur costs to stand this new enforcement mechanism up, and PHAs and PBRA owners would be subject to even more oversight than the onerous HUD and investor audit and management reviews that they are already subject to annually.

686
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.500
The bill could also cause overcrowding and municipal health and fire code violations.

687
01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:41.000
PHAs in many municipalities have occupancy standards to prevent dangerous overcrowding in apartments.

688
01:43:41.000 --> 01:44:09.000
If this bill were enacted as written, a PHA or PBRA owner could not deny a resident's request to add a household member who'd completed a drug rehabilitation program, even if doing so would result in the unit becoming overcrowded and in violation of local health or fire codes or the PHA or owner's occupancy standards.

689
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:29.000
As I've stated, I'm not an attorney, but if state law, in fact, would preempt local regulation, then municipalities would be forced to exempt Section 8 public housing and PBRA units from health or fire codes related to occupancy standards.

690
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And then I think maybe it's representative Stapleton who raised the question about the definition of substance use disorder treatment.

691
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
We have this question as well.

692
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Is there an applicable definition of substance use disorder treatment or rehabilitation program as referenced in the bill?

693
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.500
Are these programs typically accredited?

694
01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:57.000
Is there state licensure or certification requirement?

695
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.500
What would suffice for verification if not?

696
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:08.500
Would it be left to the housing providers to determine what constitutes a bona fide program?

697
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:24.500
And if so, what protections would housing providers have against claims of disparate impact if they found one program to be legitimate, but another not, absent some definition provided by the state?

698
01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:36.000
And finally, as Representative DiLorenzo mentioned and others, current HUD regulations don't prohibit individuals with substance use disorders from eligibility in any case.

699
01:45:36.000 --> 01:46:02.500
Other than those statutorily prohibited from participation in federally assisted housing programs that I described earlier, PHAs and PBRA owners already have the regulatory flexibility to consider mitigating factors like completing drug rehabilitation programs when screening applicants who'd otherwise be denied assistance because of prior criminal convictions, poor housing, credit issues, et cetera.

700
01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:17.500
In fact, HUD recently issued guidance encouraging housing providers to revise their eligibility screening procedures so that applicants with concerning histories can provide documentation of mitigating circumstances prior to denial.

701
01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:28.500
In the past, housing providers denied first and then allowed applicants with mitigating circumstances to apply for reconsideration through a hearing process.

702
01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:44.000
Now, allowing applicants to demonstrate mitigating circumstances up front accelerates the screening process for applicants and owners and removes an intimidating and time-consuming step from the screening process for the applicant.

703
01:46:44.000 --> 01:47:02.500
In other words, existing rules already allow for individuals who've completed a drug rehabilitation program to be admitted into Section 8 and Section 9 programs, but they are not admitted by right, as this bill would do.

704
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:12.500
Instead, they must otherwise be eligible for assistance according to the federal laws and regulations that apply to all applicants.

705
01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:55.500
Okay, I apologize for the length of my testimony, but as you can see, this is a very technical issue, and the bill creates basically a cascade of problems, and I really wanted to try and share some of the breadth of the problems and I actually cut some out from my testimony so is the bottom line here for our purposes that this really isn't necessary because whatever whatever information Representative Lekas' constituent may have said about what was told to her, it's not correct.

706
01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:04.000
There's not a prohibition, a flat prohibition on somebody being a tenant if they've gone through rehabilitation.

707
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Yeah, that is correct.

708
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:21.000
I mean, without knowing the particulars here, often when folks are denied housing that they've been waiting for for a long time, they hear that and understandably get really upset.

709
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And there's often more to it.

710
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:38.500
And unfortunately, the regulatory labyrinth that we have to navigate is hard to wrap your head around, even if you've been doing it like I have for 24 years.

711
01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:49.000
And so trying to explain it to somebody who's desperate for housing, why they're not eligible can obviously make people upset.

712
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Questions for this witness?

713
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Mr.

714
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Chair.

715
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Representative DiLorenzo.

716
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.500
Thank you for your testimony.

717
01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.500
It was excellent.

718
01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.500
Thank you.

719
01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:20.000
One of the questions that came up when I spoke with a gentleman from HUD was I asked him if the New Hampshire legislature has the authority to make rules for HUD programs.

720
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
What is your opinion on that?

721
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Well, I'm not an attorney, but I think what you will encounter is supremacy clause issues where the states, and again, I'm not an attorney, but a state typically, I don't think, can pass a law that directly countermands a federal law, and this bill as drafted would do that.

722
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
You're welcome.

723
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
All right.

724
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Other questions?

725
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Representative Stapleton.

726
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.500
Yeah, thank you for taking my question.

727
01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:17.500
Government applications and forms tend to be rather lengthy and thorough, and I've got to imagine that the Section 8 HUD housing applications are fully replete with all kinds of questions relative to this subject matter.

728
01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.500
Is that the case?

729
01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.500
Yeah, that is correct.

730
01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:39.000
I mean, we do the best we can within the regulatory flexibility that we're provided to make those applications as penetrable as possible, but they are much longer than we would like and quite thorough.

731
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:44.500
And of course, things like criminal background, we do those checks.

732
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:48.500
We have to do a criminal background check.

733
01:50:48.500 --> 01:51:03.000
But a lot of sort of the end of my testimony is sort of focused on, and what DiLorenzo mentioned as well, is that we can consider mitigating circumstances.

734
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:12.500
You know, it's not, there's just a few federal statutory prohibitions, and those are the ones that I mentioned.

735
01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:16.500
And there's no getting around those from us.

736
01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:23.000
We put our funding at risk if we try to work around those.

737
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
You're welcome.

738
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Other questions?

739
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Representative Tripp.

740
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Thank you for taking my question.

741
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Since we're not really sure where this person is trying to find a place to live, can I ask if the HUD regulations in Massachusetts are the same as they are in New Hampshire?

742
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
They are.

743
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
It's a federal program.

744
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000
The 1937 Housing Act was an act of the U.S.

745
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Congress.

746
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:11.000
So we could have some certainty that if we tell Representative Lekos that what you've told us is true in other places.

747
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I've worked in Massachusetts and Texas.

748
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Thank you.

749
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
You're welcome.

750
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.500
Other questions for this witness?

751
01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:24.000
Seeing none, thank you very much, sir.

752
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Thank you.

753
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000
It was a very informative testimony.

754
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
I appreciate it.

755
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Thank you very much.

756
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
All right.

757
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.500
Do you have your testimony to give to us?

758
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.500
I do.

759
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:44.000
Where should I bring it?

760
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Right up front.

761
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.500
Right here would be great.

762
01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.500
Thank you.

763
01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.500
Okay, sure thing.

764
01:52:52.500 --> 01:53:07.000
Actually, you could give it to Representative, well, I was going to say you could give it to Representative Horrigan right there, and he'll get it around to us.

765
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Thank you.

766
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Okay, you're welcome.

767
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Thank you.

768
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Is there anyone else here who wishes to be heard on House Bill 1672?

769
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:38.500
Seeing none, I'm going to close the hearing on House Bill 1672 and fortunately for once we're actually a little bit ahead of the game so we will recess until 11 o'clock to hear House Bill 1684.

770
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.500
Thank you.

771
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.500
Thank you.

772
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.500
Thank you.

773
01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:46.500
Thank you.

774
01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.500
Thank you.

775
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500
Thank you.

776
01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.500
Thank you.

777
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.500
Thank you.

778
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.500
Thank you.

779
01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.500
Thank you.

780
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.500
Thank you.

781
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.500
Thank you.

782
01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.500
Thank you.

783
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500
Thank you.

784
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.500
Thank you.

785
01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.500
Thank you.

786
01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:12.500
Thank you.

787
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.500
Thank you.

788
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.500
Thank you.

789
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.500
Thank you.

790
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500
Thank you.

791
01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.500
Thank you.

792
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500
Thank you.

793
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.500
Thank you.

794
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:29.000
Thank you so much, Mr.

795
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.500
Chair, and thank you, Honorable Members, for the record.

796
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.000
My name is Ellen Reed.

797
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:53.500
I represent Rockingham 10 New Market and New Fields, and I am here to introduce HB 1684 on behalf of the recently resigned Honorable Dan Hines, but I'm not just doing it as a formality.

798
01:54:53.500 --> 01:55:02.500
I actually offered to co-sponsor this, so I am personally fully in support of the bill as well.

799
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.500
Representative Wallace.

800
01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.500
Thank you.

801
01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:49.500
So consortium, when we talk about liability, consortium is the effect effect the emotional damage one experienced from losing companionship we do have a loss of consortium already in the books but it only extends to spouses and it is not defined so this bill quite wisely i think and and i think well defines loss of consortium that's the very first that section uh roman number one as the loss of love companionship you wisely, I think, and I think well, defines loss of consortium.

802
01:55:49.500 --> 01:56:12.000
That's the very first, that's section, Roman numeral one, as the loss of love, companionship, comfort, care, assistance, protection, affection, society, and moral support, the loss of enjoyment of sexual relation of a spouse, or the loss of ability to have children with a spouse.

803
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:22.500
So it gives a definition, a pretty good definition for consortium, which again, we already have loss of consortium for spouses.

804
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:43.500
It then extends that loss of consortium, first of all, to children, which if you can imagine someone either negligently or intentionally harming or killing your child, you know that the damages far exceed whatever monetary impact that might have on you.

805
01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:49.500
That's probably one of the most awful things a person can experience.

806
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:54.000
And we don't extend that consortium to children currently.

807
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And then it also extends loss of consortium to pets.

808
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.500
And I think most of us have probably had a pet.

809
01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:16.000
And again, we know that if someone were to intentionally kill our pet, that it's not just the replacement value of the animal.

810
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.000
That would mean nothing to us.

811
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:25.500
A few hundred dollars or what have you would mean nothing to us.

812
01:57:25.500 --> 01:58:04.000
It feels quite unfair that you can't go after someone for intentionally taking away this, and it may sound trite, but a member of your family so for those reasons i am fully in support of this bill and i'm happy to take questions i will say that the honorable heinz is in is a lawyer um and will probably be able to better answer legal questions but i'm happy to do my utmost representative Thank you.

813
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I have a question.

814
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:21.500
So if someone, if I have a dog and someone kills that dog, are you saying that there is no law that says I can't go after them for doing that?

815
01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:24.000
For the, like, monetary damages.

816
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.500
So let's say you spent.

817
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.500
Criminal charges.

818
01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:58.000
Well, the criminal charges, but we we're talking about so all of this section 507 is liability so that's civil like going after them civilly and right now an animal is considered an object and so if if you got anything you would get the replacement value of that animal in terms of buying a new puppy, for example.

819
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:01.000
You wouldn't get your dog back.

820
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:09.000
You know that your dog is not replaceable, and certainly not for a few hundred dollars.

821
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:29.500
So when someone takes your pet away from you like that, that is them doing significant emotional damage to you in a very unfair and unjust way, and people should be able to go after people who do that to them.

822
01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:43.000
So what this bill is saying that not only what could I get the value of my property the dog back but I could get emotional damage.

823
01:59:43.000 --> 02:00:37.500
In so many words it's it's It's not general emotional damages which would be a broader category it's specifically loss of consortium which again we already have when it comes to spouses so right now if someone were to like vehicularly homicide my spouse and i know i just butchered grammar there i could go after them for for civil loss of consortium they hurt me by removing my companion but we don't do that with anything else and I think everybody should be able to grade children should fall under that category and so should your pets representative Tura yeah thanks thank you for taking the question I.

824
02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:48.500
I guess in your introduction, you mentioned that this is about the death of a child or the death of a pet.

825
02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:59.000
When I'm looking at this, it looks like the specification of death is only related to the Section 4 on pets.

826
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:19.500
So I'm wondering, is this intended to be, I mean, I guess my traditional understanding of LOSA Consortium is it means it does not mean your spouse has to have died, but rather that something has interfered with your loving relationship.

827
02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:31.000
Is that, could you clarify what the meaning of that is if this were to be expanded beyond sort of just your spouse?

828
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Thank you.

829
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:44.500
So again, not being the lawyer that drafted it, I'm happy to refer details of that question to the lawyer that drafted it.

830
02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:54.000
But in the definition that's given here, it's the loss of love, companionship, comfort, care, all of those things.

831
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:01.000
So however that loss takes place, in many cases, it would be a death.

832
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:09.500
But however that loss takes place is, you're still that companionship, and therefore that should be covered.

833
02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:12.500
Any other questions for Representative Reed?

834
02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.500
Seeing none, thank you.

835
02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.500
Thank you.

836
02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:18.500
Former Representative Dan Heise.

837
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.500
Thank you, Mr.

838
02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:22.500
Chair.

839
02:02:22.500 --> 02:03:05.000
And I did submit written testimony last night representative Reed did a good job of summarizing adding to my testimony to answer the representative's question that was just asked so I am distinguishing between pets and children to me they're the same but to others not so much so the difference in this bill, if it expands to pets and children, is children, I'm leaving the standard as negligent or intentional, which is the current standard for loss of consortium for loss of a spouse.

840
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:12.000
But when it comes to the pets, I upped the mental state to reckless.

841
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.500
So it's a higher burden of proof.

842
02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:20.000
But also I did limit it to just death.

843
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:31.500
I would be happy to support an amendment that did expand it to injury, but I figure a start is better than nothing.

844
02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:40.000
So as it refers to pets, this bill specifically for lust consortium would only be for death.

845
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:48.500
But for children, it would be the same as it is for a spouse, injury or death.

846
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:56.000
And so Representative Reed did a good job of describing what a loss consortium is.

847
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:03.500
And to answer the other representative's question, so it's basically an additional cause of action.

848
02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:14.000
So right now, if someone killed my spouse, I might have other remedies, one of them being emotional infliction of distress.

849
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
We don't have that for animals.

850
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:32.500
I submitted in my written testimony a decision by a judge, which I believe is case law throughout the state, that we just don't extend that emotional distress damages to pets.

851
02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:41.000
So unfortunately, yes, if someone intentionally murders my pet, I can get the replacement value of that.

852
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I got my dog in a shelter eight years ago.

853
02:04:46.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I a couple hundred dollars no animal pet is worth two hundred dollars to someone um so this bill instead of expanding it broadly just to all emotional damages does limit it to um what specifically i'm defining as loss and for consortium and um as was pointed out our state law doesn't have any definition of it so certain there's probably case law on it.

854
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.500
I don't handle loss of consortium claims.

855
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:31.500
But I picked what I believe loss of consortium to be and what another state uses the definition.

856
02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:35.500
The other thing I'd like to just address.

857
02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:38.500
So other states do allow this.

858
02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.000
In my written testimony, I submitted a journal article.

859
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.500
I believe five states have it in different forms.

860
02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:57.500
And some of them are broader than what this would be, and others more limited than what this would be.

861
02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:01.000
So it's kind of a middle ground.

862
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:08.000
The way this is potentially broader than other states is not limiting the damages.

863
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:16.500
So if there were to be a cap on it, I still think that's better than nothing.

864
02:06:16.500 --> 02:07:02.000
I don't think there should be a cap cap i think the jury should be able to decide so what would happen is if someone brought a case um and proceeded to jury trial someone would testify how much that pet meant to them and what type of assistance they gave um so i can foresee an example if someone has a guide dog or some type of animal that they use for a disability would expect that would have a lot more value than someone whose hamster might have died.

865
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:10.000
So at the end of the day, someone would be able to testify to the loss.

866
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And the purpose of our civil system is to make someone whole when they've been the victim of an injury.

867
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:28.000
In this case, the animal being injured, but that injury just doesn't extend to the animal.

868
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000
It touches upon their owner and other people.

869
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:45.500
In regards to other states that have passed it, one of the things is Tennessee, I believe it was, defined knowingly to also include the word unlawful.

870
02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:53.000
So I think that might be a good amendment if the committee were so inclined.

871
02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.500
However, our statute, I believe, does have built-in protections.

872
02:07:57.500 --> 02:08:19.000
So I expect a lot of the opposition to this bill would be an argument that veterinarians, if they're injuring animals or killing animals, that they shouldn't be held liable because their costs will go up and therefore your costs will go up.

873
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I think if veterinarians are recklessly or intentionally harming animals, then their costs should go up and they should possibly be going out of business that a better vet could come in.

874
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:46.000
But we have medical malpractice laws and we don't use that same logic saying, hey, you're going to increase our medical bills.

875
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.500
Let's get rid of all medical malpractice.

876
02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:52.000
That just doesn't make sense.

877
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.500
Again, there's protections in this bill, my language specifically, to make it reckless.

878
02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:16.000
And in regards to knowingly, if it's unclear, let's just say the vet is putting the animal to sleep per the wishes of the owner, I do not think this bill would apply to that.

879
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:28.500
But just to make it clear, if you wanted to add the word unlawfully with knowingly, that might make sense to do just to clarify.

880
02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:42.500
But the built-in protections are the original bill has the words in a proper action, and then it further goes on to deal with what's called comparative negligence.

881
02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:55.500
So, for example, if I'm negligent in harming you, but you somehow are also negligent, then what a jury will do will typically offset the damages.

882
02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:59.500
So that's already built into the existing statute.

883
02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:02.500
So I copied that language over.

884
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:07.500
But it might make sense to add the word unlawfully.

885
02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:49.000
The reason I don't think it might not be needed is our statute for loss of spouse doesn't presently have that so i can imagine if my if someone kills my spouse but that person who killed her was acting in self-defense certainly that's not murder i can't imagine a jury proceeding with or even a court allowing this to go to um a jury trial on that issue so i don't think it's needed but it might make sense just to clarify.

886
02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:56.000
And then other states that did do it, they did have some further exceptions.

887
02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:21.000
So I'm happy to resubmit the testimony of the couple other states that do have similar bills, because they have various exceptions, some applying them to bets, some applying them to nonprofits, some of them applying when animals are basically in someone else's yard, injuring fowl or things like that.

888
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:26.000
So it might make sense to build those things in.

889
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:36.500
But the difference between this and the other states is, so I'm limiting it specifically to loss consortium and non-economic damages.

890
02:11:36.500 --> 02:11:42.000
So other states that have dealt this, they do further protections.

891
02:11:42.000 --> 02:12:10.500
So they allow veterinary expenses and other burial expenses, things in that match nature that are considered economic so they don't fit in the loss of consortium statute they might be in a better place or a different place of law um i think that is pretty much it and i'm happy to take any any questions.

892
02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:12.500
Questions for this witness.

893
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.500
Representative Perez.

894
02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:16.500
Thank you.

895
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.000
Thanks for taking my question.

896
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:27.500
Would you be adverse to putting a monetary value in Section 4 when it came to pets?

897
02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:37.500
And the reason why I say that is because you're leaving it up to the judge, and judges are human.

898
02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:45.000
If they like dogs, they may say do one thing, or pets, or they don't.

899
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:59.500
If your shepherd was killed, and I'm a judge, and I have five shepherds that are my family, would you be opposed to putting a monetary value in there?

900
02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:05.000
I think it would make more sense to put a cap.

901
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:47.000
So at the end of the day day um in new hampshire entitled to a jury trial i believe it's fifteen hundred dollars so i expect most of these cases are going to go to a jury so at the end of that i think the jury is in the best position to listen to the testimony and see how much harm was really done to that person but i believe it was tennessee has a cap i think they set it at five5,000.

902
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.500
So I think a cap's still better than nothing.

903
02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:59.500
But I think at the end of the day, it's just we can't imagine all things.

904
02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:37.500
So like I said, if someone has a seeing-eye dog or someone that they really use to assist their entire life, $5,000 might be very inappropriate for that person where someone else might be entirely appropriate other questions yes representative stapled yeah thank you and thank you for taking my question again in the section Roman for damages recoverable shall be subject to diminution to the extent and in the manner provided for in RSA 507.

905
02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:41.500
Can you talk about that a little bit?

906
02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:44.500
I'm not sure what that means.

907
02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:48.500
Yes, so that was our comparative negligence statute.

908
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:58.000
I believe when I, I didn't relook it up last night, but I believe that's a comparative negligence statute.

909
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:09.000
So my example was if I, if the person who is harmed or in this case, the pet, I guess did something.

910
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:25.000
So let's say in this case, if my animal was like provoking someone else or something like that, running at them, attempting to bite them, something like that, might bar recovery altogether.

911
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000
But at a minimum, it's certainly going to offset it.

912
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.500
So it's basically a comparative negligent statute to potentially offset damages.

913
02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:47.500
So a jury would look at how much liable one person is versus the other and kind of calculate and do a percentage generally.

914
02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:49.500
Yes.

915
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:51.500
Okay, that's helpful.

916
02:15:51.500 --> 02:16:11.500
Is it possible that, you know, in making a case for the amount of harm that you incurred on loss of consortium, is it not very highly subjective and could be variable to a large extent on a case-by-case basis?

917
02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:51.000
And this is a job for judges and juries to parse through and, you know, difficult culture in other words it certainly is difficult um but our laws um i mean they're not always black and white each case is different and the goal is to make someone whole so we have emotional um infliction of or infliction of emotional distress already um those yes i one jury could award a hundred dollars and another might award a million.

918
02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:57.000
At the end of the day, I think each case is different.

919
02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.500
The facts will be presented.

920
02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:13.500
And in this case, so like I said, we also have a loss of consortium for wives, so the same argument would apply, but we still allow it.

921
02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:28.000
At the end of the day, I think the jury is in the best situation to listen to all the facts and how someone is affected by that loss.

922
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Yes.

923
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:39.000
So in one case, a person is distraught and maybe has to take some pills for a depression.

924
02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:57.000
In another case, if they're admitted to treatment, clinic, or hospital, because they're really off the deep end, and are there other mitigating circumstances or contributing circumstances, this could still be a complex ball of wax.

925
02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Can it not?

926
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Yeah, absolutely.

927
02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:13.000
And I do believe at the end of the day, the jury is in the best situation to answer that question or address damages.

928
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:37.000
if they do find liability then the next step would be damages other questions yeah just just an open question um the idea of expanding the loss of consortium definition to children and pets i'm wondering why um the the base definition remains with spouse and why YouTube.

929
02:18:37.000 --> 02:19:35.000
LOSS OF CONSORTIUM DEFINITION TO CHILDREN AND PETS, I'M WONDERING WHY THE BASE DEFINITION REMAINS WITH SPOUSE AND WHY YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO ADDRESS OTHER TYPES OF, YOU KNOW, LOVING RELATIONSHIPS THAT HUMAN ADULTS, I GUESS I'LL CALL IT, YOU KNOW, THAT MIGHT FALL INTO A VERY SIMILAR SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCE AS SOME OF THE of circumstance as some of the ones that you've included particularly say around pets or or you know the love you have for your children thank you um sarah boleyn might be able to better do some statutory interpretation so the reason i put the word spouse in two parts of the definition is there's no good way to put it.

930
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I don't want people claiming certain sexual losses of a pet and a child.

931
02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
That's just ridiculous.

932
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I don't think any jury would do that.

933
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:55.000
That's the reason it's limited just so someone doesn't even try to do that.

934
02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:04.500
But the word spouse in the two spots I do have it should not include all the other commas.

935
02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:54.000
least that that's my interpretation that's my intent um if that is incorrect i would hope it gets uh changed to meet my intent representative de lorenza thank you mr chair um thank you for taking my question uh representative honorable dan hines um so since we're applying human characteristics to pets can we switch that around and say you know let's say I was murdered and I have a pet would my would my pet be um eligible for consortium they wouldn't just because pets can't proceed with any type of cause of action it's an interesting question.

936
02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:00.000
But no, this only applies to the owner and not the PEP.

937
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Thank you.

938
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.500
Other questions for this witness.

939
02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:08.500
So can I, I just have a couple.

940
02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:11.000
Am I understanding correctly, Mr.

941
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Hines, that the way this is drafted, the, a parent would be entitled to make a claim for loss of consortium of a child Thank you.

942
02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:39.000
that the way this is drafted, a parent would be entitled to make a claim for loss of consortium of a child, even if the child was not a minor.

943
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:48.500
So if my 53-year-old daughter was injured negligently by someone, I could make a claim for loss of consortium.

944
02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:55.000
Yes, and the reason for that is I think each case is different.

945
02:21:55.000 --> 02:22:03.000
So if that child lives with you, I think that is something that should be recoverable.

946
02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:11.000
You are losing companionship, love, comfort, care of that person, even if they're not a minor.

947
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.500
So I did not limit it to a minor.

948
02:22:15.500 --> 02:23:29.500
If the committee thinks that's better, I still think it's better than nothing that's the reason that and the other thing is it does that it also there's no limitation that only one person gets the consortium so that for example if my 53 year old daughter is married and she's injured her husband can file a claim for loss of consortium and so can i yes i think the damages would potentially be different in that case i would think the spouse had would should require them be able to recover the most damages especially if they were planning on having a child with that person um but uh yes it all three could recover um and so you might be able to better explain it so i know a lot of times when there's recovery, it kind of gets split amongst parties if there's joint liability.

949
02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:36.000
So I don't know if that concept would kind of apply or anything.

950
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:50.000
I don't think my wording would, if it does make sense to kind of limit it so that there's one pool of money that gets split amongst people.

951
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Maybe that makes sense to do.

952
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.500
And just one final question.

953
02:23:55.500 --> 02:24:00.500
Do you know, put the pets aside for the moment.

954
02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:10.000
Can you tell us how many other states allow loss of consortium for the, with respect to a child?

955
02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Yep.

956
02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:21.500
So I don't have the exact number, but in doing research just last night, it looks like some do.

957
02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:27.500
And then of those states, some also allow it for the parents.

958
02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:34.000
So there are states that allow it some one way, some the other.

959
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:42.500
The more common one is the one for the child, but some states also do allow it.

960
02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:45.500
Can you give us a number?

961
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:49.500
I mean, how many states roughly allow this?

962
02:24:49.500 --> 02:25:01.500
I don't know, but I'll get that answer to you as I further submit testimony or the written testimony just of those two statutes.

963
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:06.500
So I will try to get that answer for you.

964
02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:08.500
All right, great.

965
02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:10.500
Thank you.

966
02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:13.000
Other questions for this witness?

967
02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Thank you very much.

968
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Thank you.

969
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.500
Next, I'm going to call on Stacey Ober, please.

970
02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:26.000
Good morning, Chair Lynn, members of the Judiciary Committee.

971
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.500
My name is Stacey Ober.

972
02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:35.500
I am the New England Manager of Government Relations for the American Kennel Club.

973
02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:44.000
And I'm here this morning before you to express opposition to Section 4 of House Bill 1684.

974
02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.500
The American Kennel Club was established as a nonprofit in 1884.

975
02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:56.000
And we are a recognized trusted expert in canine health breeding and training.

976
02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:11.000
We're going to be talking about the American Kennel Club was established as a non-profit in 1884, and we are a recognized, trusted expert in canine health breeding and training.

977
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:20.000
We advocate for the purebred dog as a family companion and promote the ideals of responsible dog ownership.

978
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:30.500
We also represent over 5,000 dog clubs nationally, including 13 here in New Hampshire, which represent thousands of constituent dog owners.

979
02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:45.000
The New Hampshire Dog Owners of the Granite State is our federation of dog clubs, and they have submitted testimony to you this morning, but have a scheduled conflict.

980
02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:52.500
They're down testifying in front of the House Environment and Agriculture Committee at this time.

981
02:26:52.500 --> 02:27:05.500
I wanted to acknowledge that House Bill 1684 would expand the relationships eligible for potential loss of consortium damages to include individuals relationships with their pets.

982
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:19.000
Our understanding is that loss of consortium was originally designed to respect the sanctity of a spousal relationship and the companionship that comes from a spousal relationship.

983
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:32.000
And the calculation of damages in those cases are very subjective and are typically based on shared activities by a couple, housework, cooking, the sexual relationship.

984
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:43.500
They base it on the severity of the spouse's injury, and also a jury would look at the state of the couple's relationship.

985
02:27:43.500 --> 02:28:01.500
Our concern is that House Bill 1684 would have unintended negative consequences by including pets in the category of loss of consortium, even though more and more American Society views and has pets for companionship purposes.

986
02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:16.000
And the reason I say that is that non-economic damages are traditionally only allowed in cases involving close family of people who have died or have been severely injured.

987
02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Allowing them in cases with pets may signify an implicit change to the legal classification of animals as property, which would destabilize the predictable and reliable system of laws that protect both animals and owners' rights.

988
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.500
So what do I mean by that?

989
02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:48.000
Basically, here in the United States, laws governing animal ownership and animal care have been remarkably consistent for over 200 years.

990
02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:59.000
The traditions provide that pets are considered the legal property of their owners while benefiting from laws governing their care and treatment.

991
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:05.000
It does not mean that we care for our pets any less.

992
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Rather, it simply provides the legal framework by which owners derive the right and the responsibility to provide care in a manner that is best for the animal.

993
02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:47.500
When combined with criminal laws prohibiting animal cruelty and dog fighting and civil laws addressing both intentional and negligent injury and killing of animals, the classification of pets as legal property has served as the foundation of a stable legal system that promotes responsible animal ownership, deters animal abuse, and promotes innovative, affordable, and quality animal care.

994
02:29:47.500 --> 02:30:01.500
So we would respectfully request the committee to strike section 4 of the bill and I'm here to answer any specific questions that you might have as well.

995
02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:03.500
Questions for this witness.

996
02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:05.500
Representative Stapleton.

997
02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:10.000
Thank you, and thank you for taking my question.

998
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.500
I think you just hit something there.

999
02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:16.500
Animals as legal property, not persons.

1000
02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:18.500
Yes, sir.

1001
02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:21.000
That's a pretty significant distinction.

1002
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:25.000
That's the position of the American Kennel Club.

1003
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:38.500
We consider ourselves an animal welfare organization, and there are some organizations that philosophically have been advocating for animal rights analogous to the legal rights of humans.

1004
02:30:38.500 --> 02:31:09.000
And so we frequently will see legislation proposed that would include pets in a category of other vulnerable human categories like children or the developmentally disabled in the spirit of, yes, trying to incrementally change the laws and have the laws treat and categorize pets synonymous with those who enjoy legal rights but are unable to independently protect those legal rights.

1005
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:34.500
So I see this bill as an example of that movement to signify a change in the legal status and framework and our concern is that it would significantly disrupt a system that, for instance, protects animals by imposing on owners that responsibility to provide care for their animals, for instance.

1006
02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:46.000
So if that were a fundamental change to happen, I think it would basically throw the legal framework into some degree of disarray.

1007
02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Thank you, and thank you for that background.

1008
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.500
Other questions for this witness?

1009
02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:55.500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

1010
02:31:55.500 --> 02:32:00.000
I'll submit some written testimony for you as well.

1011
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Thank you.

1012
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Thank you.

1013
02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.500
You know, I wonder, Mr.

1014
02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:14.000
Hines, I wonder, since you're here, if I could ask you one other question, please.

1015
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:30.500
Can you tell me, and I'm not sure I know the answer to this, but I think that this may be true, that a claim for loss of consortium is a derivative claim.

1016
02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:56.000
In other words, can somebody, if, for example, if my wife were injured in an accident, not killed, but just injured, and she decided not to bring a lawsuit against, let's say, the other driver, could I bring an independent action for loss of consortium where she didn't bring an action?

1017
02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
I actually don't know the answer to that.

1018
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
I think the answer is no, but I'm not positive on that.

1019
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I'm not sure.

1020
02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:11.500
I'd be happy to look into that.

1021
02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:21.500
So I gather it's by case law as opposed to statute, because I didn't see anything in reading the statute.

1022
02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:24.500
So that could be the case.

1023
02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:31.000
If it is, I guess our – So here's what I'm worried about.

1024
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:38.500
If that is the case, and I think it might be, but I'm not positive.

1025
02:33:38.500 --> 02:34:30.000
If that is the case, then this expansion that you want, I mean, I could – would that also be limited that the, in other words, there can only be a claim for loss of the consortium relating to a child if whoever is able to bring a lawsuit for the child, and obviously if the child is an adult, it would be the child itself, but if the child is a minor, the parent would have to bring a claim for the law, in the name of the child or for the benefit of the child in order to get the consortium.

1026
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Is that correct?

1027
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Without knowing, I guess, the derivative issue, I'm not sure.

1028
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:44.000
If so, I believe this would be the statute to get rid of that.

1029
02:34:44.000 --> 02:35:53.000
So I'm not sure when that i guess i'm i'm unsure because i think i think regardless the parent would still have a claim whether it's um just like the spouse of the former spouse or unfortunate or it could be dead spouse um would still be bringing a claim so if you're saying they need to bring another claim to get this one in i think they still could have that um if you're saying that the decedent would have to bring the claim um i gather a parent definitely could do that for a minor um i think if someone's i guess i'm not sure exactly when i guess since I was just tracking the language of a spouse, I didn't think of this issue, but I would think it would still be allowed to proceed.

1030
02:35:53.000 --> 02:36:08.000
But maybe it makes sense to make it so that this is an independent action that doesn't require other actions, just because I don't know the answer to that question.

1031
02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
All right.

1032
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
No, thank you.

1033
02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Thank you very much.

1034
02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.500
I was able to find the answer to your other question.

1035
02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:24.500
32 states have some form of familial loss of consortium.

1036
02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:26.500
Filial.

1037
02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:28.500
Sorry.

1038
02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:31.500
So allowing the child to bring.

1039
02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:33.500
Okay.

1040
02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:35.500
All right.

1041
02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:37.500
Thank you.

1042
02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:39.500
All right.

1043
02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:42.000
Other questions for this witness?

1044
02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Thank you very much.

1045
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Joan O'Brien, please.

1046
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Thank you, Jim.

1047
02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:52.000
My point was made already, so I'll pass.

1048
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Joan O'Brien please.

1049
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
All right.

1050
02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:05.500
So is there anyone else here who wishes to be heard on House bill 1684 yes Come on up.

1051
02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:09.500
Secretary, you should have a card that we...

1052
02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:11.500
Oh.

1053
02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:13.500
It was packed.

1054
02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:16.000
For Kirsten, Shelton, Jim Hedon.

1055
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:20.500
Is there one right in front of you there?

1056
02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:22.500
Okay.

1057
02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:25.500
Sorry, I, I didn't see you.

1058
02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:27.500
All right.

1059
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.500
Yeah.

1060
02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:31.500
Thank you.

1061
02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:33.500
I'm Kirsten Schultz.

1062
02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:36.500
This is my colleague, Jim Hadam.

1063
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:39.500
We're both attorneys with Nixon Peabody.

1064
02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:46.000
We're here with Nixon Peabody in the Manchester office here in New Hampshire.

1065
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:59.000
We're here on behalf of State Farm, one of the leading writers of auto and home insurance in the United States and here in New Hampshire.

1066
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:06.000
We'd like to express our opposition to HB 1684 relative to loss of consortium.

1067
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:14.500
I think I'll speak first if that's all right, and then I'll pass it over to Jim.

1068
02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:24.500
I'm going to bring a sort of litigator perspective to this, I think, and Jim has a more insurance-specific perspective.

1069
02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:33.500
We've also submitted our written statement for the record, and I'll just summarize the main concerns in there.

1070
02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:53.000
Primarily, the bill is concerning because it significantly expands the definition of loss of consortium, along with the categories of family members who are entitled to seek those damages in ways that we think are inconsistent with existing law.

1071
02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:05.500
So by their nature, as Chairman Lynn, you just noted, you've already picked up on this most important point, loss of consortium claims are derivative.

1072
02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:17.500
You know, if there's no liability on the merits for an underlying injury claim, then there is no loss of consortium claim available either.

1073
02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:25.500
So, and at its common law origins, essentially consortium was defined in a really limited way.

1074
02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:39.500
It was sex services and society, sex services and society, and it was only available to a husband for injuries that his wife might have sustained, physical injuries.

1075
02:39:39.500 --> 02:40:03.000
And it was only in 1967 that New Hampshire took the sort of necessary but bold, I suppose at the time, step to extend the availability of those lost consortium damages within a marriage to wives for similar damages that they sustained when their husbands were injured.

1076
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:17.500
Since then, our courts have consistently declined to recognize causes of action for lost parental consortium brought by a child or for a parent's loss of a child's consortium.

1077
02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:29.000
And this there's a line of cases extending from I think Siciliano, the capital city shows back in the early 80s on forward.

1078
02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:36.500
More recent one is Harrington, the Brooks drug and the courts cited the same concerns.

1079
02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:44.500
I think that State Farm is raising today essentially about extending consortium claims in those cases.

1080
02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:54.500
They were worried about an unwarranted expansion of liability and that recognition of such claims would lead to increased litigation.

1081
02:40:54.500 --> 02:41:32.500
For example, in Siciliano, where the court had declined to recognize a parental right of consortium for a minor who had been injured or killed, I think injured in that case, the court stated its concern that the social burden of providing damages for this loss will ultimately be borne by the public through increased insurance premiums or an enhanced danger that accrues from the greater number of people who will choose to go without insurance.

1082
02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:43.000
And later the Harrington court echoed these same concerns in a similar type of claim between a parent and a child.

1083
02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:53.000
And based on its own analysis to of public policy considerations, as well as the common law and existing statutes.

1084
02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:04.500
And, you know, extending to essentially a bereaved pet parent is also very, very inconsistent with the derivative nature of lost consortium claims.

1085
02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:23.500
And I believe it was Representative DiLorenzo who asked the question before about whether a pet could pursue a claim, and that is the heart of what is sort of wrong, the logical fallacy essentially underlying this bill.

1086
02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:30.500
Of course, we can all understand the emotional appeal of allowing such a claim.

1087
02:42:30.500 --> 02:43:08.500
No one would deny that pet owners can feel truly profound loss if a pet is taken from them but as again the siciliano court had recognized you know not every relationship is even legally recognized relationships necessitates its own cause of action and it does not follow logically that a pet owner could pursue lost consortium damages because there's no underlying claim for bodily injury or personal injury from which that consortium claim could derive.

1088
02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:11.500
The pet cannot bring a claim.

1089
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.500
He has no claim.

1090
02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:15.500
There's no cognizable claim.

1091
02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:38.500
You know, there are a lot of creative legal arguments, I think, out there in academia that talk about recognizing the rights of non human animals and they're really interesting to read and lots of smart people thinking about those things, but we're not there yet.

1092
02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:45.500
And those efforts have been universally unsuccessful in all other jurisdictions in states elsewhere.

1093
02:43:45.500 --> 02:44:17.000
And so for those reasons, I think we think it's appropriate to follow the weight of authority that exists in other states that, you know, from my, you know, just general research that what I've looked at, I think there might be between maybe 12, anywhere between 12 and 17 other states that recognize some degree of familial consortium claims in non-death cases.

1094
02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.000
But it's far from the majority.

1095
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:23.000
It's far from the vast majority.

1096
02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:32.500
And so for these reasons, we would ask you that you vote an expedient to legislate on this bill.

1097
02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:39.500
And I will turn it over to Jim, but happy to answer questions too.

1098
02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:46.500
All right, questions for this witness first before we hear from the other one.

1099
02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:48.500
All right.

1100
02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:50.500
Thank you.

1101
02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:52.500
Yes.

1102
02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:56.000
Yes, again, Jim Hadam for the record.

1103
02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:06.000
And I'm here as a non-litigator to give you a perspective on why this is a concern to State Farm.

1104
02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:31.500
And, you know, whenever we see a bill that comes up that involves the increase of a definition of a category of damages and the addition of parties who can claim those damages, we inevitably wonder how that's going to impact the policyholders in the state, the citizens of New Hampshire.

1105
02:45:31.500 --> 02:46:22.000
As Kirsten testified earlier earlier it's clear that a bill like this would have some impact on the insurance and insurance rates um and you know and what we do is and we do this in many other circumstances whenever there's a bill that um has has a potential impact on rates there's an opportunity to actually ask the actuaries who can to quantify what that impact impact might be in the House Commerce Committee frequently does this when a bill is in front of them where they would be asked to adopt mandatory benefits in the air of health insurance.

1106
02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:34.500
And by getting that information, you as legislatures and policymakers have an opportunity to see the cost versus the benefit of these types of bills.

1107
02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:44.000
I'm going to, there is this expansion of the laws of consortium is not just happening in New Hampshire.

1108
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:51.000
It's happening in many other states, and it happened last year in New York.

1109
02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:59.500
And the governor vetoed a bill that was going to expand the loss of consortium rights substantially.

1110
02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:32.000
And part of the reasons that the governor vetoed the bill was that it indicated, an actuarial study indicated that there would be a 40 percent increase in rates and so I'm not saying this would increase 40 rates by 40 percent but that's the type of information I think it'd be important for the legislature to have before it before it makes this decision.

1111
02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:39.000
State Farm can only speak from the perspective of an auto and homeowners insurer.

1112
02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:48.500
You've heard from the folks, one of the businesses or a business that's in the area of pet care.

1113
02:47:48.500 --> 02:48:04.000
You'd also have to think about how it might impact medical by practice insurance, which is, we all know, very expensive and very hard to get for our health care professionals.

1114
02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:09.500
And also it would have an impact on businesses in general.

1115
02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:26.500
So before you would consider this bill further, I would suggest that an actuarial study would be appropriate so that you could have all the information in front of you before making a decision.

1116
02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:28.500
So thank you.

1117
02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:30.500
Thank you.

1118
02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:32.500
Questions for this witness.

1119
02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:34.500
Representative Greese.

1120
02:48:34.500 --> 02:48:37.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1121
02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:46.000
How many claims of loss of consortium are there presently that State Farm then has to pay?

1122
02:48:46.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Well, I would say plenty, but I don't have a number and you know that's actually what goes into the actual study they look at how many claims involve loss of consortium and then they quantify the awards in the in the settlements and you know they come up with the number the actuaries come up with a number so Other questions?

1123
02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.500
I thought I saw somebody.

1124
02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:23.000
Representative Wallace, did you have a question?

1125
02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1126
02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Okay.

1127
02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Any other questions?

1128
02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
All right.

1129
02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.500
Thank you very much, sir.

1130
02:49:33.500 --> 02:49:35.500
Thank you.

1131
02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:37.500
Thank you.

1132
02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:39.500
All right.

1133
02:49:39.500 --> 02:49:46.000
Is there anyone else who wishes to be heard on House Bill 1684?

1134
02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Seeing none, I'm going to close the hearing on House Bill 1684.

1135
02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:58.500
And before we recess for lunch, I wonder, I'm speaking for myself now.

1136
02:49:58.500 --> 02:51:24.000
My inclination is that there are at least two bills, I would say, but one in particular that we might be able to exec right now if the ranking ranking member agrees and i'm thinking specifically about uh hb 1672 which it sounded like we pretty much we heard we pretty much heard evidence that there was not that that this was not a problem that the uh somebody might have been given him the representative might have been given miss the constituent of the representative might have been given inaccurate information but that this isn't really necessary so if the ranking member agrees I would think we might be able to um exact this now all right so um Ben um on House Bill 1672 um I would move inexpedient to legislate second seconded by representative wallace um is there any discussion on 1672 all right then um i would ask the uh clerk to call the roll please on uh motion of inexpedient to legislate on House Bill 1672.

1137
02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Vice Chairman Wallace.

1138
02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000

1158
02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000

1161
02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Not here.

1162

Rep Smith?

1163
02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Yes.

1164
02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Rep Horrigan?

1165
02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Yes.

1166
02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Rep DiLorenzo?

1167
02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Yes.

1168
02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Rep Devine?

1169
02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Yes.

1170
02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Rep Lanza?

1171
02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Yes.

1172
02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Rep Manos?

1173
02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Yes.

1174
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Rep Chair?

1175
02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Yes.

1176
02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Chairman Lin?

1177
02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Yes.

1178
02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.500
Motion passes 14 to 1.

1179
02:52:48.500 --> 02:54:06.000
Any reason that this can't go on the consent calendar all right yeah representative testament are you are sorry if it goes on the consent calendar no no consent all right all right we'll go on the regular calendar oh okay i'm sorry i'm sorry all right consent thank you all right great thank you um so then again i um with regard to uh 1684 the loss of consortium my inclination is we may be able to this now my sense is that this is that this is that this is not a good idea at least based on the current information that we have certainly I I would say extend expanding this to pets just I mean I again I'm speaking for myself if other and I I completely understand how people love pets they love their pets but to extend legal liability in this manner seems to me to be a stretch.

1180
02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:19.500
And I am concerned even with the expansion to children because of, I mean, the expansion of potential impact on insurance rates and that kind of thing.

1181
02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:41.500
But the other thing that sort of bothers me is, given the way it's drafted, it would be, I could see situations developing where it's not limited to minor children, where you could have a situation of causing some kind of problems within families.

1182
02:54:41.500 --> 02:55:00.000
If the spouse is the one that would get, under current law, would be the one that would be entitled to consortium benefits if the spouse that was injured brought a lawsuit but only in those circumstances.

1183
02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:13.500
Now you'd have the potential that the, you know, the mother or father of the person potentially would have a stake, so to speak, in the recovery.

1184
02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:17.000
How does that interact with the spouse?

1185
02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:23.000
It just seems to me that this is not a good idea.

1186
02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:35.000
So I would be inclined to ITL it, and I guess I'd ask the ranking member her view on whether we should do that.

1187
02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
All right.

1188
02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.000
So I guess what I want to say is this.

1189
02:55:42.000 --> 02:56:06.500
I don't want, if members of the committee want to have more time before we exec this, if people are sort of conflicted or think we should take more time, I don't want to rush to a vote if there are people that think we should not do that.

1190
02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:30.000
But if the ranking member and I, you know, but but if there if people do have a different if if people don't have a different view, then I would be prepared to to, you know, to move to make a motion and have us vote now.

1191
02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Representative Katah.

1192
02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:52.000
I'm wondering if it may make sense to interim study this to kind of look into some of the things that were brought up, because I mean, where there's 32 other states that are allowing this, at least for children.

1193
02:56:52.000 --> 02:57:18.000
I mean, I get, I take your point about, you know, this isn't just involving minor children, and perhaps that needs to be looked into more, but I mean, I think the loss of a child is a pretty significant thing, and I'm just wondering if perhaps we should look into it.

1194
02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Sure.

1195
02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:46.500
The only question, the only thing I would say is, and I want to hear from Representative Smith also, but the only thing I would say is, as Representative Smith pointed out before, if we take into the interim study route, that means that we need to do something else at some point.

1196
02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:57.500
And so that's the, I guess that is, you know, are we, do we want to do something else at some point?

1197
02:57:57.500 --> 02:57:59.500
That's really the question.

1198
02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:02.500
Representative Smith, I think you want.

1199
02:58:02.500 --> 02:58:04.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

1200
02:58:04.500 --> 02:58:06.500
Thank you.

1201
02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:10.500
I just had a question for Representative Kutab.

1202
02:58:10.500 --> 02:58:18.000
Will you be chairing the subcommittee on this bill over the summer during election year?

1203
02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Thank you.

1204
02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
So I'm sorry.

1205
02:58:22.000 --> 02:59:15.500
I guess, is it possible that maybe we could hold it and maybe we could potentially look into some of these things now and amend it prior i don't unless i want to hear what rep smith has to say i guess first we get a lot of bills in this committee um not as many as education but a lot of bills it is not the committee's responsibility to take a bill that may or may not have a core idea and then do all the work necessary to get it into a bill where the committee could take ownership of the quality of the research.

1206
02:59:15.500 --> 02:59:32.500
I think that our former colleague said probably a dozen times, yes, this is a problem, but the committee could find the answer, or this isn't quite right, but the committee could amend it.

1207
02:59:32.500 --> 02:59:46.000
With all due respect, and we certainly miss him and wish he was still here with us, I don't think this bill is ready for prime time.

1208
02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:54.000
There are a lot of issues that are raised that would need a lot of work.

1209
02:59:54.000 --> 03:00:11.500
I mean, I just think when the attorney who's representing the Allstate view talked about the kind of research that would have to be done, I don't think any of us are ready for that.

1210
03:00:11.500 --> 03:01:16.500
If this is a good idea, then there'll be members of this committee and others who will do the work on their own and come in with a bill that's ready for the committee to consider and i just don't think this one is uh representative stapleton and then representative greece i concur completely with representative smith representative greeson the uh what i see in here is an opportunity for a right of consortium for loss of a child and i agree it should be limited to minor child but i don't see anything where there's a loss of a child, and I agree it should be limited to minor child, but I don't see anything where there's a loss of a parent or a claim by a minor child.

1211
03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:19.000
I think about my wife.

1212
03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:42.000
She was seven years old when her father was killed by a drunk driver, so she got to live the next 11 years without a father before she moved out, not to mention her four-year-old sister and her one-year-old brother who grew up without a father.

1213
03:01:42.000 --> 03:02:12.000
So I don't see any right of consortium there, and so you can't tell me that the loss of a father isn't a pretty significant event on the life of a child with a loss of love and companionship and comfort and care of a father, unless we want to go ahead and declare right here that fathers are irrelevant.

1214
03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:17.500
I'll take personal exception to that one just so you'll know.

1215
03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:20.500
I happen to have two children.

1216
03:02:20.500 --> 03:02:37.000
So I think the bill actually is forgetting one portion where it could be, but I also agree that it is not the onus is not on the committee to do the homework.

1217
03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:41.500
So I would think that it would be okay.

1218
03:02:41.500 --> 03:02:53.000
It's acceptable to me anyway to put the onus back on the bill's sponsor to write an amendment and get it to us.

1219
03:02:53.000 --> 03:03:07.500
If we hold off on executing this for at least another, I guess it would be not next week, but the following week, give time to draft an amendment.

1220
03:03:07.500 --> 03:03:15.500
I definitely think you need to drop the pet section, though I can't go for that.

1221
03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:17.500
Mr.

1222
03:03:17.500 --> 03:03:19.500
Chair?

1223
03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:21.500
Yes, Representative Lorenzo.

1224
03:03:21.500 --> 03:03:31.500
As far as, you know, including children in this bill, isn't there already a basis for remedy in tort law?

1225
03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:44.000
Well, I mean, certainly a parent, if a child is injured or harmed, certainly a parent can bring a lawsuit in behalf of the child.

1226
03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:55.500
The difference here would be that when the parent brings a lawsuit in behalf of the child, the recovery is for the child.

1227
03:03:55.500 --> 03:04:05.500
This would allow sort of an additional recovery for the parent, which is not sort of allowed under current law.

1228
03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:13.000
So, look, as I say, I would be prepared to vote on this bill now.

1229
03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:17.000
It sounds like Representative Smith would be also.

1230
03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:32.500
On the other hand, I don't want, if people think we should give this more time and are not ready for a vote, then I'm not going to have a vote.

1231
03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:45.000
And so I guess my, let me just ask initially, just for a show of hands, who thinks we should not vote on this now?

1232
03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Anyone else?

1233
03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
Representative Perez.

1234

Thank you.

1288

Thank you.

1289
03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
Thank you.

1290
03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
Thank you.

1291
03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000

1294
03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
Thank you.

1295
03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Thank you.

1296
03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
Thank you.

1297
03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
Thank you.

1298
03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Thank you.

1299
03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Thank you.

1300
03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
Thank you.

1301
03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
Thank you.

1302
03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Thank you.

1303
03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
Thank you.

1304
03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Thank you.

1305
03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Thank you.

1306
03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Thank you.

1307
03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Thank you.

1308
03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Thank you.

1309
03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
Thank you.

1310
03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:13.000
you like being retired all right um it's after one and i'm going to open the work session on House Bill 1002.

1311
03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:40.500
and so I guess what I'd like to just ask as a general question first to the members of the committee is just this general thing is it was the bill was remanded to us by the house to consider additional, consider other information, as I recall, or additional potential ways of dealing with this.

1312
03:08:40.500 --> 03:08:49.000
So I guess the general question I have for everybody is, are people open to considering options?

1313
03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:59.000
In other words, is there anybody whose view is, this bill is just bad and we should just kill it?

1314
03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:03.500
No matter, there's nothing that would change your mind.

1315
03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:13.500
Can I just ask you for a show of hands, if people have that view, would you let me know?

1316
03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:32.500
All right, so that's one 1002 1002 right okay, so that's a show of hands again, so it's one two Three four five six seven eight okay, so eight people would not be in favor of any change.

1317
03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:34.500
All right.

1318
03:09:34.500 --> 03:09:49.000
Okay, so I guess, so Representative Kutab, I think you have some proposed things for us, for those of us who are willing to consider other options to consider.

1319
03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
Excuse me, Mr.

1320
03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
Chair.

1321
03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.000
Maybe I need to back up a bit.

1322
03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:40.500
I'm saying as well as of what we know right now it's straight no for me if an amendment comes to me that I think we could work with and that's fine but right now there's nothing okay all right no I'm sorry then I then I maybe it maybe I was not as clear as I wanted to be what I I'm really saying is, are there people on the committee that there are no amendments that could possibly get you to agree with this bill?

1323
03:10:40.500 --> 03:10:43.500
That's what I was really asking.

1324
03:10:43.500 --> 03:10:45.500
So, yes.

1325
03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:48.500
I'm rude, and I'm interrupting you.

1326
03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:52.000
I'm sorry, and I apologize for that.

1327
03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.500
No, it's not all right.

1328
03:10:54.500 --> 03:10:56.500
I do apologize.

1329
03:10:56.500 --> 03:10:59.500
But this is a work session.

1330
03:10:59.500 --> 03:11:01.500
Right.

1331
03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:32.000
I'm wondering why you choose to begin the work session that way rather than saying this is a work session, we are going to consider what's before us, which, and there has been some work done to be presented to us and not ask people whether their minds are closed before they've even seen the work that disparate groups have done.

1332
03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:59.500
Well, I guess what I would say is my sense is that if there are people that say there's nothing you can do that's going to cause me to change my mind, then I guess my view would be, okay, So we, you know, we don't, we're not going to be able to accommodate you.

1333
03:11:59.500 --> 03:12:02.000
So there's, so let's talk.

1334
03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
I mean, the.

1335
03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:35.000
view would be okay so we we you know we don't we're not going to be able to accommodate you so there's so let's talk i mean the discussion basically would be among those who who are open to to uh consideration i i guess i would say i mean that's that's fine and it's just a different approach that I use.

1336
03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:42.500
I try not to make my mind up until I know what the options are.

1337
03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:51.000
And when I know what the options are, I can then say yes, no, or maybe so.

1338
03:12:51.000 --> 03:13:38.500
But I don't want to be in a situation where I'm told don't let the facts get in your way of your decision and that's the only that's the only comment and if it's I don't mean to challenge you I mean and I don't it's just a different way of looking at it I guess and so having said that I back no no no I hear what you say I guess what I'm saying is I mean, I'd like to think that my philosophy of dealing with things is the same as yours.

1339
03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:59.500
I want to hear what, but it sounds like from, I mean, I asked the question because it sounds like, at least with respect to this issue, that there may be some people who don't have that view with regard to this.

1340
03:13:59.500 --> 03:14:03.000
And that's why I asked the question.

1341
03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:14.000
But anyway, to move on to Representative Kutab, could you just tell us you have a proposed way of handling this situation?

1342
03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.500
And I wonder if you could just explain that to us.

1343
03:14:19.500 --> 03:14:21.500
Sure.

1344
03:14:21.500 --> 03:14:25.000
So I'm going to hand these out.

1345
03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:31.000
So I did work with Right to Know New Hampshire, who Ms.

1346
03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:48.000
Coco had a coalition of several people who were initially in opposition to the bill, including but not limited to the ACLU and the Press Association and a big kind of coalition of people.

1347
03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:58.000
And we worked together to really try and find somewhere that we might be able to meet some common ground.

1348
03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:13.500
And so what this amendment does is it changes it to first say that the cost would only be for for-profit companies that were using it for a commercial for-profit purpose.

1349
03:15:13.500 --> 03:15:25.500
But it also added that in order to give the charge, that they'd need to give an itemized estimate, so not just an estimate.

1350
03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:29.000
These other pieces are the same here.

1351
03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:42.500
And then for the purposes of this section, commercial use means a request for information for use or purpose that furthers in commercial trade or profit interest.

1352
03:15:42.500 --> 03:16:04.500
It does not include a request that's made for the purpose of attaining information for publication or broadcast by an individual employed buyer connected with or a freelancer of a newspaper, magazine, of general circulation, weekly publication, press association, or radio or television station.

1353
03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:09.500
So we've exempted the media from this commercial piece here.

1354
03:16:09.500 --> 03:16:20.000
The commercial use piece, they can charge for excess time in excess of three hours, not to exceed 25 an hour.

1355
03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:36.000
The reason why we've kind of brought that time down is because many people, they were even in opposition to the regular people paying it when we're talking about out-of-state commercial entities.

1356
03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:41.000
They're like, why are they getting any time for free?

1357
03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:45.000
And why is it only 25 an hour?

1358
03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:48.500
Why aren't they paying the full cost?

1359
03:16:48.500 --> 03:17:51.500
So I was trying to kind of come up with some common ground there then we've added a vexatious request piece which was modeled off of some language from Pennsylvania but at this point has had some other additions to it so I would say that it's kind of a collaboration at this point and I i wouldn't necessarily say that it's just solely based on one thing but um and it says after attempting to reach a reasonable modification or resolution with a request or a public body or agency may deny a request that the public body or agency deems intended to disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on the essential functions of the body or presents an unreasonable probability of having such effect.

1360
03:17:51.500 --> 03:17:53.500
Or presents a reasonable...

1361
03:17:53.500 --> 03:17:58.000
Oh, sorry, a reasonable probability of having such effect.

1362
03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:04.000
For any claim by a body, the request is an unreasonable burden.

1363
03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:08.000
The provisions of this section shall be followed.

1364
03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:16.500
The public body shall provide the requester a written statement with their reasons for denying the request.

1365
03:18:16.500 --> 03:18:41.000
After giving the requester 10 days to retract their request, the public body shall file a complaint within seven days to the end date of the retraction period with the ombudsman pursuant to RSA 91A7B or with the Superior Court for a determination of whether the denial was reasonable.

1366
03:18:41.000 --> 03:19:00.000
The public body's complaint shall contain relevant affidavits detailing the alleged vexatious nature of the request, and the burden shall be on the public body to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the request is vexatious.

1367
03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:11.500
The ombudsman or court shall issue a ruling within 60 days or other reasonable time period granting or denying the access of records.

1368
03:19:11.500 --> 03:19:16.500
Any party agreed by decision under this section may appeal.

1369
03:19:16.500 --> 03:19:27.500
At any time during the proceedings under the section, the Ombudsman or Superior Court may recommend that both parties participate in mediation.

1370
03:19:27.500 --> 03:19:41.000
If both parties agree, the mediation shall last for a period of up to 90 calendar days and may be extended with the agreement of both parties.

1371
03:19:41.000 --> 03:20:17.500
During the mediation and any other proceedings under this section shall be stayed unless otherwise other unless otherwise ordered by the ombudsman or superior court so we've we've now taken away any charges for people you know regular people requesting things this is literally just be if somebody is putting in request after request that are really large requests and they're never coming to pick them up, that could potentially be considered vexatious.

1372
03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:37.000
If they're putting in such a huge request that so many people are going to have to work on it that it's going to impede the essential functions of the body, which is a pretty big burden to prove.

1373
03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:51.000
We're talking quite a big request, like you'd have to maybe be asking for 100 years of information or something like depending on what town you're going to.

1374
03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:57.000
So I think, you know, we've compromised on a lot of this.

1375
03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:06.500
I know that Gilles had sent a note in about, you know, kind of wanting to include online blogs.

1376
03:21:06.500 --> 03:21:54.500
But I think there were several that were really in opposition to that because any commercial entity can go ahead and create an online blog giving some information about their solar panels, you know, in Florida, and now all of a sudden they're media, and so they don't have to pay for their commercial request, and that's really just not the spirit of it, and I would say that the online publications such as like the New Hampshire Bulletin, the New Hampshire Journal, all of those are included as part of the New Hampshire Press Association.

1377
03:21:54.500 --> 03:22:03.000
So I'm not, it's not excluding all online blogs, but just ones that aren't considered news media.

1378
03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:32.000
So that's kind of the direction that we've kind of gotten to try and come up with some sort of compromise on a way to kind of move forward and address the concerns that were the reason that we put in the bell and i'm happy to take any questions on it all right questions from representative Alexander.

1379
03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.000
Thank you, Mr.

1380
03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:36.000
Chair.

1381
03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:39.500
Thank you, Representative, for taking my question.

1382
03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:49.000
So my first question is why in the amendment it changes the time from 10 hours to 3 hours.

1383
03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:56.500
That seems like going in the opposite direction from what opponents of the bill indicated.

1384
03:22:56.500 --> 03:23:06.500
Because it's much easier to make up 3 hours worth of work than, you need 10 hours worth of work.

1385
03:23:06.500 --> 03:23:08.500
Yeah.

1386
03:23:08.500 --> 03:23:13.000
So that piece only applies to commercial use pieces.

1387
03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:16.000
It doesn't apply to regular requesters.

1388
03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:32.500
And in doing this, actually, even people that were against the initial bill, many of the people said to me, why are our tax dollars paying for any request for any commercial purpose?

1389
03:23:32.500 --> 03:23:42.000
If the purpose of them putting it is for profit, they should take the costs out of their profit.

1390
03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:47.500
We shouldn't be, our tax dollars shouldn't be paying for that.

1391
03:23:47.500 --> 03:24:01.000
And keeping in mind that a lot of these requests are coming from people that are in Florida, California, like they're not even New Hampshire based things.

1392
03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:21.500
But this isn't saying that a company that's asking for something because, you know, the business lives in town, is in town, and they want to know what, you know, something about something being built next door or something, zoning things.

1393
03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:27.000
That's not, they're not asking for that for a for-profit purpose.

1394
03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:32.000
They're asking for that for, you know, a non-for-profit purpose.

1395
03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:35.500
So that wouldn't be included in here.

1396
03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:40.000
So it's dependent on the data that you're asking.

1397
03:24:40.000 --> 03:25:00.500
If you're, if you're going to go and ask for, you know, all of the, the building data, cause you want it to sell your solar panels and you should have to pay for the person to kind of do it.

1398
03:25:00.500 --> 03:25:11.000
And again, this isn't even some of the people were like, well, I don't know why it's only 25 an hour.

1399
03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:14.000
It should be the actual costs.

1400
03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:21.000
But again, it was me trying to come up with a compromise on it.

1401
03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:24.500
So if I could follow up, Mr.

1402
03:25:24.500 --> 03:25:52.500
Chair, are you, I guess I'm wondering what's to stop BAE as a commercial entity from just having a member of the public request the information they need when it says, and I understand for commercial purposes, but like, is the municipality then allowed to ask the requester the motive behind why they're requesting the information?

1403
03:25:52.500 --> 03:26:00.000
Like, don't you think that like, it's not their, it's like, it's not their problem.

1404
03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:04.500
Like they don't need to tell them the motive.

1405
03:26:04.500 --> 03:26:09.000
We don't impug motive on members of this committee.

1406
03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000
Yeah.

1407
03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:31.500
So the, the commercial requests that are coming in that are for private purposes, they're, they're typically like very obvious why you're asking, but absolutely somebody could, could try and do that if it was some unobvious purpose of doing it.

1408
03:26:31.500 --> 03:26:46.000
And there's nothing to stop because we're not making it that strict in that purpose, but it's just trying to limit the ones that are truly for profit purpose.

1409
03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:49.500
And they're gonna be selling that data.

1410
03:26:49.500 --> 03:26:58.500
And a lot of times those requests are coming in directly like on email letterhead from those companies.

1411
03:26:58.500 --> 03:28:41.000
So it's obvious that they're for commercial purposes they're not coming in from somebody's gmail no i i understand i guess i'm like what what is this bill solving if there's a workaround for the one thing that we're putting in place that's that's the it's not really question more of a a thing to say like there's i just wondering like have we amended it or possibly amended it to a point where it's not solving any problems it's just passing no i think it is solving that problem still because i think i i again i do think it's incredibly obvious when these commercial requests are coming forward and then i do think it also is giving that option when there is a request so large that it's going to impede the essential functions of a body so i do still think that those those pieces are important pieces to have in and i especially i i also want to say that when i was looking into a lot of this there's a lot of other states that already have this in place and there was five other states with bills on the same subject so this isn't a a New Hampshire problem.

1412
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.000
This is a growing problem across the U.S.

1413
03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:51.000
No, and this is the last thing I'm going to say, Mr.

1414
03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000
Sheriff.

1415
03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000
That's okay.

1416
03:28:55.000 --> 03:29:07.000
The other problem I have is with essential functions, because I believe strongly that government's most essential function is to respond to the public.

1417
03:29:07.000 --> 03:30:20.500
So to be accountable to the public, and this is a way for the public to do it it so when we're taking away that opportunity whether it's for commercial purposes or or what say you it it defeats the essential function in my belief of government what their job should be other people have other uh representative ferrez thank you caitlin i know you work really hard on this and I give you a lot of credit and I know this is people have been not the nicest to you about this but I have I'm gonna be straightforward commercial use is not really defined in here I still wanted one of the problems that happened in Londonderry when Kevin Smith, who was our town manager, ran for Senate, is that requests came in from all over the United States and from different parties came in.

1418
03:30:20.500 --> 03:30:23.000
And some came from California.

1419
03:30:23.000 --> 03:30:28.500
And it was a huge burden to the town of Londonderry.

1420
03:30:28.500 --> 03:30:37.500
And I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of the reps in Londonderry supported this.

1421
03:30:37.500 --> 03:30:39.500
This doesn't cover that.

1422
03:30:39.500 --> 03:30:55.000
I mean, if I decide to run for president and I live in Londonderry, this is not covering all the information people are going to try to find out about me.

1423
03:30:55.000 --> 03:31:24.000
But the other thing is, I personally, and from what I've heard from my constituents, unless it is not applicable for someone who lives in a town or someone who owns a business in the town, then, and I know you can have somebody from out of town say, hey, Caitlin, would you put this in for me?

1424
03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:26.500
I can't go for it.

1425
03:31:26.500 --> 03:31:32.500
I always say I run for the little guy and the kids.

1426
03:31:32.500 --> 03:31:43.500
This, in my opinion, is, unless it says specifically, this doesn't apply to residents of aES IN TOWN REQUESTING FROM THEIR TOWN.

1427
03:31:43.500 --> 03:31:51.500
I KNOW I CAN'T GO ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE ASKING FOR.

1428
03:31:51.500 --> 03:31:53.500
ALL RIGHT.

1429
03:31:53.500 --> 03:32:04.000
OTHER, YES, REPRESENTATURER AND, OH, I'M SORRY, REPRESENTATURER SMITH, I THINK YOU WERE FIRST AND THEN REPRESENTATURER AND THEN REPRESENTATURER STABLETON.

1430
03:32:04.000 --> 03:32:09.500
THIS IS JUST a question that shows my age, I guess.

1431
03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:12.500
Representative, you used the word media.

1432
03:32:12.500 --> 03:32:15.000
And I'm not exactly sure.

1433
03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:19.000
I don't see the word media in here.

1434
03:32:19.000 --> 03:32:44.000
I see publication or broadcast by an individual employed by or connected with a freelancer of newspaper magazine of general circulation weekly publication press association or or radio or television station and I'm not sure that media captures – I mean, the word media, I think, is larger than that.

1435
03:32:44.000 --> 03:32:57.000
And so I'm a little confused about why you would use media, except for the fact that it's easier to say than all these other things.

1436
03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:07.000
I know that on the seacoast, we used to have newspapers that actually had reporters downstairs in the press room.

1437
03:33:07.000 --> 03:33:10.500
We don't have that at all anymore.

1438
03:33:10.500 --> 03:33:17.000
And we increasingly rely on what would be non-traditional sources for news, unfortunately.

1439
03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:34.000
And so I'm just wondering if you are building a wall to keep in or keep out some of those non-traditional sources that I don't actually really know what the definition of blog is.

1440
03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:36.000
I'm serious.

1441
03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:46.000
And so enough said, but I think you see what my dilemma is about who's covered and who's not covered.

1442
03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:48.000
Of course, yeah.

1443
03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:50.500
Thank you for the question.

1444
03:33:50.500 --> 03:33:57.500
So this was the language that was used in a few other states statute.

1445
03:33:57.500 --> 03:34:06.000
And I think the reason is because you or I could go start our own blog tomorrow.

1446
03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:15.000
We could just go open it up, but it doesn't mean that we're actual, you know, press, right?

1447
03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:35.000
And so this was trying to limit that from happening because what you don't want is people that have kind of a commercial, real commercial purpose going and just starting a blog that's going to give some information on something.

1448
03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:44.000
And then they go, well, I have a blog, so I'm exempted from having to pay for this.

1449
03:34:44.000 --> 03:36:11.500
So, i think the important pieces is that well yes you're saying that some of these um traditional pieces have gone away a lot of the places that have kind of replaced them are included in the press association such as um the um patch.com is included in the press association so isn't the new hampshire journal the new hampshire bulletin um the rochester voice which is again an online publication um so i guess the ones that are more actual legitimate media pieces and not just somebody with their starting their own website blog are included on here but i don't i think if you start adding in every single blog on the planet that all of a sudden you're just anybody can start a blog i could literally start a blog in five minutes while i'm sitting here but that doesn't mean that i'm truly a part of the press or media so is it involvement with the here, but that doesn't mean that I'm truly a part of the press or media.

1450
03:36:11.500 --> 03:36:20.000
So is it, is involvement with the press association something that is crucial to this or not?

1451
03:36:20.000 --> 03:37:41.500
So that just is including some of the, it does include several of the online media pieces that we do have online that are i guess some could call maybe they could call this an online blog i would say more it's an online publication but they are all included like i did try and think of all the places where we get news to make sure that they were actually covered by this definition and i was trying to be really careful in doing that because i wanted to make sure that we weren't excluding any legitimate media thing and i also don't i mean i think we want to keep i also don't want to degrade the quality of like journalism in this either you know we have some really respectable online journalist journalism and i don't i think including every blog kind of just also kind of degrades the quality of the media that people are trying to put out.

1452
03:37:41.500 --> 03:37:50.000
And, you know, I think, I don't know, I think we depend on a lot of that.

1453
03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:52.000
Thank you.

1454
03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:54.500
We get very, you know.

1455
03:37:54.500 --> 03:37:56.500
Let's see.

1456
03:37:56.500 --> 03:38:07.000
Representative Surr, I think, and then Representative Stapleton, I think you had a question, and then we'll go to Representative Mayer.

1457
03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000
Please.

1458
03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:11.000
Great.

1459
03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:13.000
Thanks.

1460
03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.500
And thanks for bringing this.

1461
03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:18.000
There's a lot in this.

1462
03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:27.000
And I'll start off and say I sort of think there's, for my mind, three things in here.

1463
03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:31.500
Things that I like, at least to some degree.

1464
03:38:31.500 --> 03:38:41.000
Things that I am wondering whether we absolutely need from a legal standpoint, and things that I don't like.

1465
03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:45.500
And so I do like the separation of commercial.

1466
03:38:45.500 --> 03:39:09.000
I'm not sure the way this is in here is my favorite embodiment of that, because it's more about the use of the data than about the request in my mind, the commercial use of the data that you get, which may be a totally separate issue.

1467
03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:16.500
But I do think the commercial use of 91A is a problem all by itself.

1468
03:39:16.500 --> 03:39:24.500
The need part, and this is my, I guess, I sort of have two questions, sorry.

1469
03:39:24.500 --> 03:40:33.500
The first one is my understanding is that there has to be, and and this comes partly i think from our discussion with you um an alternative to the ombudsman in this legislation in order for it to stand and so that's the question of it be it this amendment or some other change do we need to make a change in order to allow the the process to to to be legitimately played out through whatever ombudsman or other this now brings in the court system could you speak to that and and then i'll ask the if if the chair allows i'll ask one more question so from my from my initial red line to ols i had put in there that they would could seek relief or something along the lines of to the ombudsman.

1470
03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:52.000
And they actually changed it to say may seek relief according to RSA 91A7B because where you're offering somebody to go to an ombudsman, you also have to offer them a pathway to go to superior court.

1471
03:40:52.000 --> 03:46:52.000
You can't force somebody to only go through an ombudsman according to the ols attorneys so that was changed in there so there is either path that both paths are now available yeah i guess i'd have to say i'm not sure i agree with that i mean i think you that certainly is under existing law it certainly is true you know without this it certainly is true that you have that you have the sort of option I'm I don't I'm not sure there would be a constitutional reason that you couldn't say for this purpose you only go to the ombudsman or you go to the ombudsman first and then you know there's all there's an appeal from from the ombudsman so I I don't know that that's you know that that you couldn't do that i guess the question would be what whether you wanted to do that or not um yeah so i think that's an interesting question that i'd love to hear sort of more clearly defined because if i and i'll say i sort of like the build the way it went to the floor um you know i i was not looking it was not one that's felt that it needed amendments but if it needs amendments then certainly there should be amendments uh the third the third part that i'll say the part that i don't like is the way that this now works i like the statement that i think you were able to make clearly originally which is this entitles you to 10 hours of your public officials time every month in perpetuity in order to get the information that you're looking for without any fees and then if your fee is if your request is so broad that's when when the the cost i felt that that sort of struck a nice balance between what we understood to be the size of a reasonable 91a request versus sort of an unreasonable or or you know uh i guess the new word is vexatious um and and this sort of now puts a whole lot more process on the municipal body to go through in order to sort of attain attain the same sort of ending that they they would have to go to the ombudsman they'd have to sort of bring a case and i even thought we we had found out that the towns don't have standing before the ombudsman i'm not sure yeah so i think the ag's office is actually here and might be able to speak a little bit to that but the ols attorney did come back and say that courts don't typically give advisory opinions they typically give determinations so you you this would in essence be seeking an advisory opinion on rather something was reasonable or not so it should actually be the requester that would go to the report but i think the ag's office might be able to offer some more information on that all right so if you don't mind just to finish that thought um so i so i think the way it was originally was a lot cleaner and a lot more comprehensible i do think there maybe could have been some additional language added to what would happen if the ombudsman decided that the estimate was unreasonable i was kind of hoping we'd be able to say a little more that um but i feel like this kind of really weakens the the underlying concept and puts a lot of burden on a municipality to use the term vexatious which it may be a definition would be good i don't know whether that's defined somewhere but it seems like you'd almost have to fill the request in order to sort of show that it's vect or fill multiple requests to show that it's vexatious so that's my representative stapleton um do i understand that this amendment replaces everything in the original to the point of also no criteria for unreasonable or extensive requests by private citizens um i why i ask that is because i've seen this play in motion where you get some activists to use nice term, private citizens who almost take joy in making it difficult for a municipality to provide information.

1472
03:46:52.000 --> 03:47:00.500
But back to my question, does it wipe out all the provisions before relative to private citizens?

1473
03:47:00.500 --> 03:47:07.000
So in regards to private citizens, no, it's replacing it with something else.

1474
03:47:07.000 --> 03:47:18.500
Although to be quite honest about it, it is a much higher burden to prove it would be much more than 10 hours.

1475
03:47:18.500 --> 03:47:36.500
It is saying that's the piece in here about that it's deemed intended to disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on the essential functions of the body or presents a reasonable probability of having such effect.

1476
03:47:36.500 --> 03:47:47.000
So it's only if your intent there is to, or that it will actually, place an unreasonable burden on the body.

1477
03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:51.000
Or if it's intended to disrupt the body.

1478
03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:55.000
Representative Manos, I THINK YOU HAD SOME COMMENTS.

1479
03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:57.000
THANK YOU, MR.

1480
03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:59.000
CHAIR.

1481
03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:03.000
I ALSO WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THE Ombudsman.

1482
03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:52.000
DO YOU VIEW THIS, REPRESENTATIVE KATAB, AS CREATING THE RIGHT OF THE MUNICIPALITY TO GO TO THE Ombudsman is this the creation of that right it is yes and that was the sticking point for the clu and for right to know new hampshire that they wanted the burden to be on the body to have to go there and not on the requester I might prefer to see that right created in a separate paragraph and to be created more clearly rather than invoking the right and having the invocation of the right be what creates it.

1483
03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:55.000
So that's my thought on it.

1484
03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000
Other representative de Laurentia.

1485
03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:59.000
Thank you, Mr.

1486
03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:01.000
Chair.

1487
03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:38.500
I'm a little bit concerned about the feeling that people other than private citizens would be able to use the ombudsman office as a um as a general routine and i only say this because i'm the prime sponsor of the ombudsman's bill and it was initially for citizens to um have a conversation with the ombudsman about, you know, issues with right to know law or issues with requests from municipalities and public bodies.

1488
03:49:38.500 --> 03:49:41.500
So it kind of skews things.

1489
03:49:41.500 --> 03:49:56.500
And it worries me because I don't want to see the ombudsman's office spend a lot of time almost time on commercial request request from, you know, big money operations.

1490
03:49:56.500 --> 03:50:00.000
And neglect the request from the citizens.

1491
03:50:00.000 --> 03:50:05.000
We only we have only have so much for capacity.

1492
03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:10.000
The ombudsman position is is due to sunset in 2025.

1493
03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:19.000
So if we were going to use the ombudsman office at that much, we would need more capacity.

1494
03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:21.000
Thank you.

1495
03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:23.500
Of course, yes, Representative Ketab.

1496
03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:27.000
Thank you for bringing up that point.

1497
03:50:27.000 --> 03:52:32.000
So the ombudsman piece, that for the um in you're talking about in relation to the commercial use request so if that piece were changed to say that the that the commercial use requester could seek relief in the superior court would that would that make better sense to you i am not totally sure because i did hear someone say that you know you can't like separate things like send your commercial request to superior court when and not give the commercial interest um a shot at the ombudsman's office so i don't i don't think that that that piece wasn't said no i don't think that's yeah but we can ask the ug's office to comment on that part but if so if that was allowed though would that be the direction that you'd prefer to go with with the commercial piece i think so okay all right other comments so one of the oh i'm sorry no representative anders i cut you off i apologize no problem thank you uh thank you to caitlin and everyone that put all the time into this bill because I know it's a lot of work but I am totally against and I won't back down from changing the current law I realize there are issues a lot of them are commercial which maybe need to be addressed but with all the the changes, to me, it's like the citizen, the everyday citizen, is the culprit, and that's totally, totally wrong.

1498
03:52:32.000 --> 03:53:12.000
The employees in the governing body are paid a wage, and that wage includes looking up right to no requests and giving out that information now in this bill here the law grants me the right under 3210 to ask for transfer of funds from any governing body which i did recently for my school district under this in here if the governing body decided my request was unreasonable or a burden on their agency, would my request be denied?

1499
03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:30.500
And are there other laws and statutes that grant a person the right to ask for information and do this amendment and the laws, I guess, bond up against each other or do they coincide or whatever?

1500
03:53:30.500 --> 03:53:32.500
All right.

1501
03:53:32.500 --> 03:53:34.500
I'm...

1502
03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:36.500
I...

1503
03:53:36.500 --> 03:53:38.500
I mean, I...

1504
03:53:38.500 --> 03:53:40.500
my...

1505
03:53:40.500 --> 03:53:42.500
If you...

1506
03:53:42.500 --> 03:53:44.500
All right.

1507
03:53:44.500 --> 03:53:57.500
I mean, my impression would be that if we adopted this amendment, if a request was determined to be unreasonable, then it would not be granted.

1508
03:53:57.500 --> 03:54:30.500
I mean, I suppose that the, I assume that an ombudsman or a court might say well you've asked for i mean i'm just making this up you've asked for all the emails of employee x for the last five years that's unreasonable um but i will you know i will order the town to provide the emails of employee x for the last six months.

1509
03:54:30.500 --> 03:54:37.000
I mean, I'm just making that up, but that might be an example.

1510
03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:42.500
I think, speaking personally, I think I'm where Representative Turr was.

1511
03:54:42.500 --> 03:54:46.500
I personally liked the original bill much better.

1512
03:54:46.500 --> 03:54:50.000
And let me explain to you why.

1513
03:54:50.000 --> 03:55:05.500
One of the things that I think everybody, including particularly requesters, should be concerned about is that if we go down this route, we are in at least to some extent.

1514
03:55:05.500 --> 03:55:11.500
we're changing the current law, which says it doesn't make any difference.

1515
03:55:11.500 --> 03:55:20.000
You don't have to tell anybody, and it doesn't make any difference why you want the information.

1516
03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:32.000
If you want all the emails for the last year because you want to paper your bathroom with the emails, that's good for you.

1517
03:55:32.000 --> 03:55:34.000
You can do that.

1518
03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:38.500
This would change that in a couple of ways.

1519
03:55:38.500 --> 03:56:20.000
First, even, for example, with the commercial requests, as I think the discussion sort of highlighted, there could be a dispute and presumably some litigation about, about well is this a commercial request or not which gets to the to the point of what do you want this information for what are you going to do with it why do you want it are you going to sell it you know because that would have some bearing on whether it's a commercial request.

1520
03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:24.000
Do we want to start down that road?

1521
03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:40.500
And the same thing, I think, would be true about maybe to a lesser extent, but still true on the question of for non-commercial requesters, is the request unreasonable because of its burdensomeness?

1522
03:56:40.500 --> 03:56:53.500
I mean, it seems to me that one of the things that would go into reasonableness, at least partially, is what do you want it for?

1523
03:56:53.500 --> 03:57:23.000
I mean, if I actually, if, you know, if I actually went to the town and said, I want all the emails for the last five years, and the town said that's unreasonable, presumably one of the things that somebody who had to decide whether it was unreasonable or not would be saying is, why do you want it?

1524
03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:41.000
And if I actually did say, because I want to paper my bathroom with all the emails, presumably that would, you know, would go a long way towards persuading the fact finder to say that's unreasonable.

1525
03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:53.500
You know, paper your bathroom with something else, but not not don't don't require the town to pay for for an employee to do this.

1526
03:57:53.500 --> 03:58:02.500
So, you know, that's maybe an extreme example, but I'm just trying to get the point across that.

1527
03:58:02.500 --> 03:58:15.000
I think this, doing it this way would change, I think, in a fundamental way, the way the right to know law has always operated.

1528
03:58:15.000 --> 03:58:41.500
But having said that, I, if there was a consensus to do something along the lines of this amendment, I would support it because even though I think this maybe is not as good a way as the original bill, I think based upon what we've heard that there is a real problem.

1529
03:58:41.500 --> 03:59:25.000
I mean, first of all, I think just as a matter of fairness, I don't see why it makes any sense for the taxpayers to have to pay for the time it takes somebody to respond, a state employee or public employee, town employee, to respond to a request from a commercial enterprise who's going to sell that information and presumably pass on the cost to its customers, why shouldn't that commercial enterprise or its customers bear the burden as opposed to the taxpayers of the town?

1530
03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:37.000
And secondly, I think based upon what we heard at the hearing, there really are some people that you know make unreasonable requests requests.

1531
03:59:37.000 --> 03:59:54.500
And sometimes, I hope not all that often, but sometimes, and not, you know, not, it's not a tiny number, are doing it because they want, they have some axe to grind with the town.

1532
03:59:54.500 --> 04:00:06.500
They think that, you know, the town is out to get me and I'm going to show them and they make these unreasonable requests.

1533
04:00:06.500 --> 04:00:14.500
And I think that's a problem and there should be some way of dealing with it.

1534
04:00:14.500 --> 04:00:26.500
Personally, I think that making them have to put up some money after a certain period of time is the way to do it.

1535
04:00:26.500 --> 04:00:52.500
But addresses it at least in some fashion and so i could support that if you know if there's a consensus for doing something like that representative alexander then representative greece thank you mr chair it it seems to me that this amendment is not adding more people to support the bill.

1536
04:00:52.500 --> 04:01:03.000
So it might be better for the prime sponsor to just see how the vote goes again on the original bill.

1537
04:01:03.000 --> 04:01:14.500
Because I don't think that, I mean, from what I'm gathering, the committee isn't on board with either an amendment on this either.

1538
04:01:14.500 --> 04:01:18.000
So that's my suggestion for the committee.

1539
04:01:18.000 --> 04:01:21.500
It might well be a good one.

1540
04:01:21.500 --> 04:01:24.500
Representative Greason and then Representative Devine.

1541
04:01:24.500 --> 04:01:29.000
Does current law define what a vexatious request is?

1542
04:01:29.000 --> 04:01:34.000
It is that grounds for the denial of a request.

1543
04:01:34.000 --> 04:01:42.000
And if it's not, then maybe we need to take this one thing at a time.

1544
04:01:42.000 --> 04:02:00.500
First is to define what a vexatious request is and allow that to be grounds for a request denial, and then if the party making the request is aggrieved by that, then you've got the appeal process.

1545
04:02:00.500 --> 04:02:49.000
But tackling this one thing at a time, if we don't even define what a vexatiousious request is we can keep throwing that buzzword around all day long and we don't accomplish anything so what if we just tackle that and we'll deal with the commercial aspect of it in some other legislation or not at all or whatever could we have the ag's office come up because they're they're here like potentially just to speak to that ground i think we did define the vexatious piece in here, but I'd like them to talk to rather...

1546
04:02:49.000 --> 04:02:54.000
Yeah, so if, would you, are you okay with that?

1547
04:02:54.000 --> 04:02:56.000
No, no, that's fine.

1548
04:02:56.000 --> 04:03:15.000
I think there, you know, I think there is a provision, as I understand, it's pretty general in current law about, you know, when attorney's fees are allowed, if a request is unreasonable, or if somebody's acted unreasonably.

1549
04:03:15.000 --> 04:03:17.500
But it's not very specific.

1550
04:03:17.500 --> 04:03:20.000
But yeah, please inform us.

1551
04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:22.000
Good afternoon.

1552
04:03:22.000 --> 04:03:24.500
My name is Jessica King.

1553
04:03:24.500 --> 04:03:30.000
I'm a senior assistant attorney general at the Department of Justice.

1554
04:03:30.000 --> 04:03:32.000
And good afternoon.

1555
04:03:32.000 --> 04:03:35.000
Good to see you all again.

1556
04:03:35.000 --> 04:03:40.500
I'm JD Lavallee LaVallee, also Senior Assistant Attorney General at DOJ.

1557
04:03:40.500 --> 04:03:47.000
And we're happy to answer any and all questions that you may have.

1558
04:03:47.000 --> 04:03:52.000
We're really just hoping to provide information to you all.

1559
04:03:52.000 --> 04:03:54.000
All right.

1560
04:03:54.000 --> 04:03:56.000
Well, are there questions?

1561
04:03:56.000 --> 04:04:05.500
So I think he was asking about vexatious defined, and I don't know if you want to elaborate on.

1562
04:04:05.500 --> 04:04:37.500
I know currently, like, the only place it is given anything is under 91A8, under remedies, that the court may award attorney fees to a public body or agency or employee or member, therefore, for having to defend against a lawsuit under the provisions of this chapter when the court finds that the lawsuit is in bad faith, frivolous, unjust, vexatious, wanton, or oppressive?

1563
04:04:37.500 --> 04:04:44.500
But I'm not sure if you know of any other area where it's defined.

1564
04:04:44.500 --> 04:04:47.500
That's BUT YOU HAD AN ISSUE.

1565
04:04:47.500 --> 04:05:28.000
I JUST HAD A COMMENT THAT AND IT'S NOT REALLY DIRECTED TOWARD the AG but I question but you had an issue i just had a comment that um and it's not really directed toward the ag but um i don't care for you know house bill 10 1002 in in the way it's been presented however some of the problems i had with it originally was it didn't really address the commercial issues, which Representative Katab has in her amendment.

1566
04:05:28.000 --> 04:06:38.500
To me, getting rid of maybe the fees for the public, the general public, a person like you or I, to come in and request a right-to-know request, maybe that shouldn that shouldn't be in here I'm more I would be more behind a commercial kind of you know bill that addressed everything that you had put in here within three three days or three hours or whatever instead of I mean you eliminated the 10 hours for the regular person and then so there's no charge for a regular person right now this is only a charge for commercial people that's for commercial use purposes but is it on on the first page here you have on line 24 that it in excess of three hours and that would be for so then if you go to and regular person?

1567
04:06:38.500 --> 04:06:40.500
Nope.

1568
04:06:40.500 --> 04:06:48.500
So then it says only under paragraph 4.3, and that's for the purposes of this section.

1569
04:06:48.500 --> 04:06:52.000
That's only for the commercial use purposes.

1570
04:06:52.000 --> 04:08:42.000
So there'd be no charge for a regular person coming in, getting documents that they need from this from the town correct so this is basically just for commercial purposes this which you presented correct and the only other piece it would be for a regular citizen is if their request was vexetious representative sure thank you for clarifying that oh i'm sorry representative sure yeah thanks um hopefully this is an appropriate question it's kind of the question I asked earlier in the original bill as it went to the floor the final sentence of the bill basically allowed a um a requester to go to the um ombudsman uh and and basically claim that the town's estimate for time was unreasonable um is there a reason why and this kind of relates to the question there also needs to be a path to the courts um offered to that person or is the the bill the way it went to the floor okay the way it just allows the the ombudsman to fill that role um so we were whispering as you were saying that conferring tend to agree with representative lynn on that piece it could go to the ombudsman and then have an appeal right from the ombudsman, which I believe is there in statute now.

1571
04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:57.000
I don't see a constitutional issue where it would go to the ombudsman first and then to the Superior Court or the Supreme Court, depending on what this body decides.

1572
04:08:57.000 --> 04:08:59.000
Quick clarification.

1573
04:08:59.000 --> 04:09:56.000
So that appeal process is already in the ombudsman statute thanks it is mr kirk yes representative lorenzo please just to clarify any person may go to court you know there's no it there's no like well you know you can't you can only go to the ombudsman if you're a citizen anyone can go to court yeah so any party can go to the ombudsman so anybody that has made a request can uh and the request has been denied that can be appealed to the ombudsman and just a point of clarification um when we're talking about vexatious there is no basis to deny a deny a request based on vexatious request.

1574
04:09:56.000 --> 04:10:01.500
That does not exist in law as it currently is written.

1575
04:10:01.500 --> 04:10:15.000
The only vexatious part is at the end if a request is denied on some other basis and it goes to the Ombudsman or to the court.

1576
04:10:15.000 --> 04:10:22.500
And at that point, if it's vexatious, then the agency can seek to recover fees.

1577
04:10:22.500 --> 04:10:30.000
But the agency or municipality cannot deny on the sole basis that's a vexatious request.

1578
04:10:30.000 --> 04:10:35.000
So this would be a big change in that regard.

1579
04:10:35.000 --> 04:10:37.000
Yes.

1580
04:10:37.000 --> 04:10:39.000
Right.

1581
04:10:39.000 --> 04:10:41.000
So you know what?

1582
04:10:41.000 --> 04:10:44.500
Can I just ask a question basically?

1583
04:10:44.500 --> 04:10:52.000
Representative Horowitz, let me just throw this question out and then we'll get to you.

1584
04:10:52.000 --> 04:10:55.000
Can I just ask this question?

1585
04:10:55.000 --> 04:11:16.500
Is, is there, if we were to make a change to the original bill in terms of the, the numbers, then it was, if instead of saying 10 hours, you know, it can start charging after 10 hours and it's $25 an hour.

1586
04:11:16.500 --> 04:11:29.000
If we were to change that to say we can start charging after 20 hours and it's $15 an hour, I'm just making this up.

1587
04:11:29.000 --> 04:11:35.000
Does that bring anybody around who was opposed to the original version?

1588
04:11:35.000 --> 04:11:37.000
Okay.

1589
04:11:37.000 --> 04:11:39.000
All right.

1590
04:11:39.000 --> 04:11:41.000
Just asking.

1591
04:11:41.000 --> 04:11:46.000
Representative Smith, does that change your mind in any regard?

1592
04:11:46.000 --> 04:11:49.000
Nobody knows what my position is.

1593
04:11:49.000 --> 04:11:52.000
Do you care to hear everything?

1594
04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:55.000
Do you care to enlighten me?

1595
04:11:55.000 --> 04:11:57.500
I want to hear everything.

1596
04:11:57.500 --> 04:11:59.500
All right.

1597
04:11:59.500 --> 04:12:01.500
Yes.

1598
04:12:01.500 --> 04:12:28.000
I also think a point to make is the ombudsman is written into here but i was a member of the committee when we passed it and it sunsets in 2025 so unless we as a committee or as a legislature renews the ombudsman this isn't this isn't going to solve the problem.

1599
04:12:28.000 --> 04:14:51.000
All right else have uh representative oregon yes yes i um remembered hearing the adjective vexatious in a hearing for another bill this committee and i was amazed discover i've been on this committee that long which was back in 2013 there's a bill about vexatious litigants although that doesn't help us with this text because it has a specific definition of vexatious litigants which was anybody who files three or four more frivolous lawsuits however and that's in a totally different chapter of the law book from 91a but i noticed in the previous right before that law which was passed in 2013 was one which dates back to the 1980s which was long before my time which does talk about frivolous actions including frivolous lawsuits so could somebody if somebody was filing totally useless large volumes of totally useless uh right to no claims they had no merit could could they under existing law be punished for filing frivolous actions or does 91a override that or how does that work and you may not know the answer i'm kind of asking a vague question that's bringing it on you but uh so on the that piece of things i'm digging into the vaults of my memory on what a vexatious litigant is but um there is a specific definition of what a vexatious litigant is and it would include um cases that are at the superior court um so it would not necessarily include a right to know requester who has made volumes and volumes of requests because again we cannot deny on the sole basis of vexation so that those claims would never or would not necessarily make it to superior court Mr.

1600
04:14:51.000 --> 04:15:07.500
Chair yes we have a question of the AG's office what if a complainant feels that their right to know requests with a municipality or other public body was denied based on prejudice.

1601
04:15:07.500 --> 04:15:09.500
What would happen there?

1602
04:15:09.500 --> 04:15:11.500
What's the remedy?

1603
04:15:11.500 --> 04:15:14.500
Thank you for your question, Representative.

1604
04:15:14.500 --> 04:15:25.500
I mean, at the moment, current law would allow them to contest the denial at the ombudsman or straight to superior court.

1605
04:15:25.500 --> 04:15:50.500
And if there's no actual basis for denial or an improper basis for denial, then the public body would be subject to, or public entity agency or public body, would be subject to the remedies under A-8, which can be the attorney's fees, the fine, the penalty, everything under law.

1606
04:15:50.500 --> 04:15:53.000
Well, may I follow up?

1607
04:15:53.000 --> 04:15:55.000
Of course.

1608
04:15:55.000 --> 04:16:02.500
So my thought is, yeah, that sounds great, but I think it's an exigent instance.

1609
04:16:02.500 --> 04:16:06.000
How quickly could a person get relief?

1610
04:16:06.000 --> 04:16:42.500
So under A8 and under the ombudsman process the the um right to know cases are intended to be processed pretty quickly depending on the circumstances since i know uh the aclu is behind me we've had a case we had a case go on for quite some time um but it depending on what what we're arguing about, but for the most part, these are going through the Superior Court quite quickly.

1611
04:16:42.500 --> 04:16:44.500
All right.

1612
04:16:44.500 --> 04:16:46.500
And you, Representative Andrews.

1613
04:16:46.500 --> 04:16:51.000
Thank you, and thank you for taking my question.

1614
04:16:51.000 --> 04:16:54.000
This is kind of a threefold.

1615
04:16:54.000 --> 04:17:22.500
number one is when is the updated governance on the 91a going to be out and is there going to be a regular schedule to update it the third question is which i don't understand what does the ag's office have to do with 91a how do you defend it and who do you defend it with?

1616
04:17:22.500 --> 04:17:24.500
Thank you representative.

1617
04:17:24.500 --> 04:17:33.000
So I can say we are tracking for March 1st for an update to the 91A memo.

1618
04:17:33.000 --> 04:17:37.000
I believe that's what you're referring to, right?

1619
04:17:37.000 --> 04:17:45.000
And we do have intentions to not only update it, but have a maintenance schedule, right?

1620
04:17:45.000 --> 04:17:54.000
To have a routine team working on making sure that memo stays up to date and doesn't languish.

1621
04:17:54.000 --> 04:18:03.000
As for, I think your third question, I think my colleague wrote it down because I did not.

1622
04:18:03.000 --> 04:18:05.000
I apologize.

1623
04:18:05.000 --> 04:18:13.500
And so I believe the third question was what role does the AG's office play in 91A?

1624
04:18:13.500 --> 04:18:17.000
So we are counselors to state agencies.

1625
04:18:17.000 --> 04:18:20.500
We are also ourselves a state agency.

1626
04:18:20.500 --> 04:19:00.000
So we both process 91A requests that come into our agency, but we counsel state agencies on how to respond to 91a requests especially where there are gray areas in the law all right representative manos you had a issue thank you mr chair i wanted to inquire whether the creation of a municipality's right to go to the ombudsman as i see it it's it's kind of on the fly here, and whether you view that as problematic.

1627
04:19:00.000 --> 04:19:02.500
Should it be more clear?

1628
04:19:02.500 --> 04:19:05.000
Should the right be created?

1629
04:19:05.000 --> 04:19:15.000
Should the right of a municipality to go to the ombudsman be created separately from the invocation of the right?

1630
04:19:15.000 --> 04:19:20.500
So I think I'm going to thank you for that question.

1631
04:19:20.500 --> 04:19:27.000
I think I'm going to take that in a couple of different pieces.

1632
04:19:27.000 --> 04:19:39.500
When we say creation of the agency's right to go to the ombudsman, textually speaking in the statute, any party can go to the ombudsman.

1633
04:19:39.500 --> 04:19:52.500
In practical terms, it really is the requester that goes to the ombudsman because the process doesn't stop until the denial happens or records aren't produced.

1634
04:19:52.500 --> 04:19:59.000
So in practical terms, it is the requester that goes to the ombudsman.

1635
04:19:59.000 --> 04:20:15.500
So I think, I don't know that we can speak to the if there are issues with the text as amended in this this amendment with the agency going to the ombudsman proactively.

1636
04:20:15.500 --> 04:20:19.000
I think there could be some concerns.

1637
04:20:19.000 --> 04:20:23.500
We just haven't had a chance to examine that.

1638
04:20:23.500 --> 04:20:25.500
All right.

1639
04:20:25.500 --> 04:20:27.500
Representative Andrews.

1640
04:20:27.500 --> 04:20:29.500
Thank you.

1641
04:20:29.500 --> 04:20:33.500
And okay, I'm going to ask a question.

1642
04:20:33.500 --> 04:20:36.500
And if I'm wrong, I apologize.

1643
04:20:36.500 --> 04:20:44.500
I understand that House bill, the original 1002, the AG's office was in favor of it.

1644
04:20:44.500 --> 04:21:37.500
And they don't normally take a position on the bill and why would they take a position on this one i think uh probably in the testimony that my colleague gave um the reason that we've we came out in support of this bill is it does create these incentives to work with the requester to narrow these requests that um as representative lynn had mentioned there there are these requests that are very burdensome to our agencies in which there's no real incentive for the requester to work with the agency to narrow the request, to really get to what the person is looking for.

1645
04:21:37.500 --> 04:21:39.500
Representative Manos.

1646
04:21:39.500 --> 04:21:41.500
Thank you, Mr.

1647
04:21:41.500 --> 04:22:14.000
So admittedly, we're working through seeing the amendment as you all are, but I think it would allow for, I think as the chairman noted, an exploration as to the intent of the request, the way vexatious is defined, right, there's an intent piece, and then there's also the impact on primary responsibilities or primary duties, as some of the other colleagues have talked about.

1648
04:22:14.000 --> 04:22:27.500
So I think there would be some litigation or some opportunity for litigation to, you know, argue about, hey, does this actually impact an agency's essential functions?

1649
04:22:27.500 --> 04:22:31.000
Is that the intent of the request?

1650
04:22:31.000 --> 04:22:41.500
So you are, in a way, exploring both intent of the requester or practical effect on the agency or public body.

1651
04:22:41.500 --> 04:23:10.000
So I guess it depends, but yes, there's room to uh explore that man so you know given the uh given the time um my i i guess if i can sum up i i i or try to sum up i think i agree basically with representative alexander and we're not going to vote this now.

1652
04:23:10.000 --> 04:23:14.000
We've only noticed it as a work session.

1653
04:23:14.000 --> 04:23:34.000
But my inclination is that it doesn't appear that the amendment proposed by Representative Kutaba, and I really thank her for her extensive work on this, is likely to kind of change the views of anybody here regarding this matter.

1654
04:23:34.000 --> 04:23:39.000
And so my inclination is that, Representative Alexander, is right.

1655
04:23:39.000 --> 04:23:44.000
When we do vote on this, we'll take a vote.

1656
04:23:44.000 --> 04:23:55.500
That's not to suggest that the amendment may be offered, and we'll take a vote on the amendment and see how that goes.

1657
04:23:55.500 --> 04:24:29.500
If anybody else has any amendments they want to propose, you're going to have two weeks to do it before we actually exec this uh again um we'll take up those also um my sense is we may end up at the point where you know the amendments the various amendments fail and then we're back to a vote on the original on the original bill um course.

1658
04:24:29.500 --> 04:25:33.000
I'm just wondering if anybody who was opposed to the original bill after seeing this amendment, if there's anything that could be done with this amendment or even as the amendment's written, if there's anybody who would, I guess, potentially support it, because I'm happy to work with people if there is a potential, if there's just some tweaking that that's needed but if you just don't like the amendment then i obviously that's okay i don't want to waste anybody's time though so would we be able to i guess ask by a show of hands if there is anybody that was originally opposed that would be you know potentially supportive of this amendment or if the amendment were to be tweaked a bit Representative Sapleton?

1659
04:25:33.000 --> 04:25:35.000
All right.

1660
04:25:35.000 --> 04:25:57.000
After reading it and focusing on it, I'm kind of getting into liking the amendment, except on page 2, line 14 and 15, the reasonable charges imposed here under, or under this paragraph, do not apply unless the request is a commercial use request.

1661
04:25:57.000 --> 04:26:03.500
I don't see anywhere else in the amendment that provides for any charge.

1662
04:26:03.500 --> 04:26:35.000
And it's a loophole for the unreasonable or extensive request by private citizens who may be activists or malicious intent and I think that leaves a open hole for abuse and if you were to cover that then I would be in favor of the amendment all right so I guess maybe with with that I'm going to close the work session on.

1663
04:26:35.000 --> 04:26:47.500
House Bill 102 and we will notice this for an executive session on on March 6th since we're not going to be sitting next week.

1664
04:26:47.500 --> 04:26:49.500
Right.

1665
04:26:49.500 --> 04:26:52.000
Right, but it will be.

1666
04:26:52.000 --> 04:27:20.000
I'm gonna add I'm gonna have to have an amended an amended notice all right so I'm gonna close the work session and then what I'd like to do now is open the executive session that is continued from our last executive session and the first bill bill that I'd like to say, oh, I'm sorry.

1667
04:27:20.000 --> 04:27:22.000
Thank you.

1668
04:27:22.000 --> 04:27:24.000
Yes.

1669
04:27:24.000 --> 04:27:26.000
Thank you very much.

1670
04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:28.500
I appreciate your being here.

1671
04:27:28.500 --> 04:27:30.500
Thank you.

1672
04:27:30.500 --> 04:28:46.500
So the first bill that I would like to take up and I want to, because there may be people here who are interested in this, we're not going to vote on this today because people haven't had a chance to to look at the amendment but we'll briefly take up house bill 1283 the end of life options bill and what what i would note is that representative smith and myself have proposed an amendment, and I asked OLS to prepare the amendment in the form that it was instead of sort of just dealing with each paragraph where there was a change, I thought it would be easier for people to follow if they just redrafted the whole bill with the changes in there and that's what you have in amendment 202 40808 H that I passed out to the committee earlier and what what I would say is this.

1673
04:28:46.500 --> 04:28:53.000
Let me just try to highlight for you the changes that this makes.

1674
04:28:53.000 --> 04:29:13.000
The first change that it makes is there was some discussion, as you may recall, about whether it made sense to have nurses who were not advanced practice registered nurses be among, be included within the definition of healthcare provider.

1675
04:29:13.000 --> 04:29:17.500
And that, and that is, we've made that change.

1676
04:29:17.500 --> 04:29:22.000
We've removed PAs from the, just the same one.

1677
04:29:22.000 --> 04:29:27.500
Yeah, we've removed them from the list of health care providers.

1678
04:29:27.500 --> 04:30:37.500
We've also, in response to testimony that was presented at the hearing we've added pharmacists under m1 Roman numeral 5 as subsection D but note that although pharmacists are now within the definition of health care provider there we specifically indicate that they do do not qualify either as a prescribing or as a consulting health care provider there we specifically indicate that they do not qualify either as a prescribing or as a consulting health care provider so they they are included but they're not going to be the ones that making are that are making decisions on whether somebody qualifies to receive end-of-life medications the the next thing that is changed is hang on one second you yeah uh in Roman numeral, in the original bill, in Roman numeral M, it's on page 3 of the original bill.

1679
04:30:37.500 --> 04:31:04.000
In the original bill, on page 3, lines 9 through 15, we reworded that because I was concerned that that could be read to suggest that the prescribing health care provider could make his or her decision based on examinations and determinations of somebody meeting the qualifications that were done by somebody else.

1680
04:31:04.000 --> 04:31:30.000
And I was concerned about that because it seems to me that this is something where the person that's making the determination ought to be the one that satisfied himself or herself that the person is qualified and not just somebody made a report to them and they signed off on it.

1681
04:31:30.000 --> 04:31:32.000
So that was changed.

1682
04:31:32.000 --> 04:31:46.500
The other thing, and this appears at several places throughout the bill, you will notice that in the definition, one of the definitional terms is prescribing health care provider.

1683
04:31:46.500 --> 04:32:19.000
But if you look later in the bill, there were some times when there was a reference to the attending provider and um we never had a definition of attending provider it seems pretty clear that the that that that what the original intent was that the attending provider is the pers is the uh prescribing so to avoid some claim of ambiguity, we changed.

1684
04:32:19.000 --> 04:32:27.000
The word is prescribing health care provider replaces attending health care provider wherever that was used.

1685
04:32:27.000 --> 04:33:09.000
And I believe that the last change of any substance appears on page 6 of the original bill in sections four and five those those provisions would as drafted would have basically said that if you are a health care entity I'll give you use the example of Catholic Center, because I think it's probably the most appropriate, that Catholic Medical Center could not tell its employee doctors, you can't provide end-of-life services even outside of your employment with us or off the premises.

1686
04:33:09.000 --> 04:33:20.000
I think there would be a real constitutional problem with that, particularly for religious health care providers, but maybe even with others.

1687
04:33:20.000 --> 04:33:22.500
So we took that out.

1688
04:33:22.500 --> 04:33:39.500
Because I think, for example, I think how Catholic Medical Center can say to its employees, if you want to work for Catholic Medical Center as a doctor, you can't provide end-of-life care anywhere.

1689
04:33:39.500 --> 04:33:44.500
And if you want to provide end-of-life care, that's fine.

1690
04:33:44.500 --> 04:33:47.500
You just can't work for us.

1691
04:33:47.500 --> 04:33:51.500
I think constitutionally they're entitled to do that.

1692
04:33:51.500 --> 04:34:13.500
And so I think it, you know, I don't think this, from my perspective, I don't think this was an important part of the bill and why have put something in the bill that raises a constitutional question that I think is not necessary.

1693
04:34:13.500 --> 04:34:46.500
It does say in the revised language, and you'll see this, that if Catholic Medical Center wants to say, our doctors can't provide end-of-life care under this act anywhere, at any time, if they're working for us, then Catholic Medical Center or other providers have to say that specifically in writing and specifically indicate that it applies both on and off premises, on and off duty.

1694
04:34:46.500 --> 04:35:00.000
If that's the terms that they want their employees to follow, they can do it, but they just have to tell them and tell them in writing.

1695
04:35:00.000 --> 04:35:03.500
And I think that's a reasonable provision.

1696
04:35:03.500 --> 04:35:08.000
So those, I think, are the major substantive changes.

1697
04:35:08.000 --> 04:35:14.000
The other thing is I saw some typos in the original bill.

1698
04:35:14.000 --> 04:35:19.000
I made some corrections there to some of the language.

1699
04:35:19.000 --> 04:35:45.500
But the substantive changes are I think I've covered them all and I'm gonna ask representative Smith if if if if I've missed something please please correct me so anyway I guess what I'd say I note that Representative Perez has also provided an amendment that proposes to repeal the Suicide Prevention Council.

1700
04:35:45.500 --> 04:35:52.500
We can take that up and vote on it when we're ready to vote.

1701
04:35:52.500 --> 04:36:10.500
My inclination is that everybody will now have the amendment and any other amendments that people want to propose within, you know, for two weeks until March 6th, which is when we will exact this again.

1702
04:36:10.500 --> 04:36:20.000
And I'll make sure it gets into the notice when we are ready to have a vote on this.

1703
04:36:20.000 --> 04:36:23.000
Yes, Representative, you had a question.

1704
04:36:23.000 --> 04:36:25.000
Mr.

1705
04:36:25.000 --> 04:36:27.000
Chair, I appreciate it.

1706
04:36:27.000 --> 04:36:35.000
I try to be, when I'm a substitute, Representative Schultz is my name, by the way.

1707
04:36:35.000 --> 04:36:37.000
Sure.

1708
04:36:37.000 --> 04:36:47.500
I try to be as low-maintenance as possible because I enjoy subbing and I defer to the wisdom of committee members.

1709
04:36:47.500 --> 04:37:01.500
What I realized, though, is there, I don't, other than a note that this is continuing your executive session of the 15th, she knows what I'm asking for.

1710
04:37:01.500 --> 04:37:03.500
Thank you.

1711
04:37:03.500 --> 04:37:05.500
Sorry to bother you.

1712
04:37:05.500 --> 04:37:07.500
Thank you so much.

1713
04:37:07.500 --> 04:37:09.500
Okay.

1714
04:37:09.500 --> 04:37:14.500
I'm not sure that I know, but yes, Representative Perez.

1715
04:37:14.500 --> 04:37:16.500
Representative Alexander.

1716
04:37:16.500 --> 04:37:18.500
Thank you, Mr.

1717
04:37:18.500 --> 04:37:20.500
Chair.

1718
04:37:20.500 --> 04:37:34.500
So the only problem I have is that I was ready to vote on this bill last week, and I'm ready to vote on this bill this week.

1719
04:37:34.500 --> 04:37:51.000
I'm wondering if the chair would entertain a motion of ITL to see where the committee is at, and if it doesn't pass, then the committee can go back to the drawing board.

1720
04:37:51.000 --> 04:38:00.500
But I feel like we keep bringing this up for exec and then say we're not voting on it.

1721
04:38:00.500 --> 04:38:12.000
Why don't we just create a work session with the members that want to get to a yes on this is my question.

1722
04:38:12.000 --> 04:38:34.000
Okay, well, I think, I mean, I think that that's not an appropriate thing to do because I think that people ought to have at least an opportunity to have looked at and kind of studied what is, you know, a fairly complicated bill.

1723
04:38:34.000 --> 04:38:45.000
So I don't think it would be appropriate to have looked at and kind of studied what is a fairly complicated bill.

1724
04:38:45.000 --> 04:38:51.500
So I don't think it would be appropriate to have a vote now.

1725
04:38:51.500 --> 04:38:53.500
Representative Perez.

1726
04:38:53.500 --> 04:38:55.500
Thank you.

1727
04:38:55.500 --> 04:38:58.000
I have studied this bill.

1728
04:38:58.000 --> 04:39:09.000
I have studied this bill line by line, and I have some information that I would like to present to the committee.

1729
04:39:09.000 --> 04:39:11.000
Is that possible?

1730
04:39:11.000 --> 04:39:13.000
Sure.

1731
04:39:13.000 --> 04:39:15.000
Absolutely.

1732
04:39:15.000 --> 04:39:17.000
Okay.

1733
04:39:17.000 --> 04:39:33.500
First, I would like to address the University of New Hampshire poll where it has been said multiple times that 71% of the people in the state of New Hampshire support this option.

1734
04:39:33.500 --> 04:39:35.500
I obtained the poll.

1735
04:39:35.500 --> 04:39:46.000
I actually spoke to Rebecca Brown from the New Hampshire Alliance for end-of-life options, and I have a lot of concerns.

1736
04:39:46.000 --> 04:39:59.000
I actually spoke at length with a man named Zach Esman about how the pollers are solicited, and I don't mean that in a negative way.

1737
04:39:59.000 --> 04:40:05.000
So let me explain a little bit about my concerns about this.

1738
04:40:05.000 --> 04:40:14.500
First of all, the poll was paid for $1,800 by the New Hampshire Alliance for end of life options.

1739
04:40:14.500 --> 04:40:19.500
And there were only two questions that they asked for.

1740
04:40:19.500 --> 04:40:28.500
And then the university adds a million things, like what do you think of Governor Sununu for demographics.

1741
04:40:28.500 --> 04:40:53.000
The first question that was asked, as you may or may not know, medical aid in dying laws give mentally capable, terminally ill adult patients who have six months or less to live the right to request and use a prescription medication to end their life if they choose.

1742
04:40:53.000 --> 04:41:13.000
Would you support or oppose legislation in New Hampshire that would allow mentally capable, terminally ill adult patients who have six months or less to live to live the legal right to use prescription medication to end their own life?

1743
04:41:13.000 --> 04:41:17.000
Very valid question for what we're talking about.

1744
04:41:17.000 --> 04:41:23.000
What really concerned me is question number two by the same organization.

1745
04:41:23.000 --> 04:41:26.500
Do you identify as having a disability?

1746
04:41:26.500 --> 04:41:42.500
A disability is a physical or mental impairment that seriously limits your life activities, such as conditions affecting a person's vision, movement, thinking, remembering, learning, communicating, hearing, mental health, or social relationships.

1747
04:41:42.500 --> 04:41:50.500
That concerned me because in my opinion it had absolutely nothing to do with this bill.

1748
04:41:50.500 --> 04:41:56.000
So I actually called Rebecca Brown and asked her why that.

1749
04:41:56.000 --> 04:42:02.500
And her response to me was that we need to consider vulnerable communities.

1750
04:42:02.500 --> 04:42:08.000
Those were her words, vulnerable communities, which again struck a chord.

1751
04:42:08.000 --> 04:42:11.000
And I asked, what about veterans?

1752
04:42:11.000 --> 04:42:13.000
What about depressed teens?

1753
04:42:13.000 --> 04:42:19.000
I found it very disheartening or something that that question was asked.

1754
04:42:19.000 --> 04:42:30.500
When I asked how people were picked, they have a company that does this and that, blah, blah, blah, and people are picked.

1755
04:42:30.500 --> 04:42:37.500
And then they send out randomly, do you want to participate in a survey?

1756
04:42:37.500 --> 04:42:39.500
There's a three-part thing.

1757
04:42:39.500 --> 04:42:45.000
They send text messages, this and that, mail, and people respond.

1758
04:42:45.000 --> 04:43:02.000
And if people respond that they want to participate, then they are invited to become part of a, and they want to participate again, they're invited to become part of a Granite State panel.

1759
04:43:02.000 --> 04:43:05.000
And this panel receives the surveys.

1760
04:43:05.000 --> 04:43:08.000
This panel is rewarded for participation.

1761
04:43:08.000 --> 04:43:12.500
So those were some of my concerns about that.

1762
04:43:12.500 --> 04:43:20.500
And then my other thing is that wording, you can word anything to get your answers.

1763
04:43:20.500 --> 04:43:34.500
For example, if I asked you if you were in favor of reproductive freedom or rights, I would bet everybody in this room would say yes, they were.

1764
04:43:34.500 --> 04:43:46.000
But if I asked you if you were in favor about abortion restrictions it would certainly split this the answers to these people.

1765
04:43:46.000 --> 04:43:49.000
I have concerns about this survey.

1766
04:43:49.000 --> 04:43:56.000
I have concerns about how this survey is being used to whatever the bill.

1767
04:43:56.000 --> 04:44:02.500
Now moving on from, I did literally go through this line by line.

1768
04:44:02.500 --> 04:44:09.500
And on line eight, and I'm going by the original bill, mental capacity, okay?

1769
04:44:09.500 --> 04:44:13.000
Durable power of attorney cannot be enacted.

1770
04:44:13.000 --> 04:44:32.000
I think we need to say that lines 12 through 14 a health care entity okay a weight loss clinic by this definition is a health care entity a medispa run by a doctor is a health entity.

1771
04:44:32.000 --> 04:44:41.000
I have a concern about the use of healthcare entity in here and that it is not tight.

1772
04:44:41.000 --> 04:44:44.500
In 15 through 20, a healthcare provider.

1773
04:44:44.500 --> 04:45:01.000
A healthcare provider and in the bill, it said according to, where is it according to rs a 329 it could be my retired dentist um i gotta oh here it is 329.

1774
04:45:01.000 --> 04:45:17.000
a person shall be regarded as practicing medicine under the meaning of this chapter, who shall diagnose, treat, perform surgery, or prescribe any treatment of medicine for any disease or human ailment.

1775
04:45:17.000 --> 04:45:43.000
Surgery means a procedure including, but not limited to, laser, in which human tissue is cut, shaped, burned, vaporized, or otherwise structurally altered, except that this session shall not apply to any person to whom the authority is given by any other statute to perform acts which might otherwise deem the practice.

1776
04:45:43.000 --> 04:45:45.500
Laser means a light application.

1777
04:45:45.500 --> 04:46:04.500
So if I go to a medispa and have a laser treatment, That person, according to this and according to this, can be eligible, or it could be argued that they are eligible to prescribe my life-ending prescription.

1778
04:46:04.500 --> 04:46:27.000
So you don't think that the language who is qualified, a prescribing health care provider means a health care provider who is qualified by specialty or experience to make a professional diagnosis and prognosis regarding the individual's disease and prescribes medical assistance and dying medication?

1779
04:46:27.000 --> 04:46:30.000
You don't think that that's sufficient?

1780
04:46:30.000 --> 04:46:49.000
Well, I think anybody who goes through anyone who goes through and you're using a nurse practitioner here as well, anyone could be considered if they had treated any of those things at any time could be qualified.

1781
04:46:49.000 --> 04:47:13.000
For example, if you go to a, I'm going to use a dentist again, you go to a dentist and he discovers mouth cancer on the inside of your jaw and treats that, he would be considered, could possibly, according to this, be considered a specialist in cancer.

1782
04:47:13.000 --> 04:47:15.000
It's too open-ended.

1783
04:47:15.000 --> 04:47:17.000
Let me go on.

1784
04:47:17.000 --> 04:47:19.000
Page 2.

1785
04:47:19.000 --> 04:47:21.000
1 through 2.

1786
04:47:21.000 --> 04:47:23.000
Number 2.

1787
04:47:23.000 --> 04:47:25.500
Am I on page 2?

1788
04:47:25.500 --> 04:47:27.500
Yes.

1789
04:47:27.500 --> 04:47:29.500
1 and 2.

1790
04:47:29.500 --> 04:47:40.500
The interviewer has a right to withdraw a request pursuant to this chapter or consent, any of their treatment at any time.

1791
04:47:40.500 --> 04:47:44.000
What happens to that legal, lethal medication?

1792
04:47:44.000 --> 04:47:46.000
What happens to it?

1793
04:47:46.000 --> 04:47:51.000
We're not supposed to be keeping leftover antibiotics at home.

1794
04:47:51.000 --> 04:47:56.000
Why would we keep, what happens to that lethal med?

1795
04:47:56.000 --> 04:47:58.000
Number six, peaceful death.

1796
04:47:58.000 --> 04:48:06.500
I have a great article here on the efficiency and safety of drugs used for assisted dying.

1797
04:48:06.500 --> 04:48:08.500
Very frightening.

1798
04:48:08.500 --> 04:48:14.000
Peaceful death does not come to all who use these drugs.

1799
04:48:14.000 --> 04:48:25.500
Peaceful death, evidence from jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal, reveals that some patients who ingest the prescribed lethal drugs experience distressing complications.

1800
04:48:25.500 --> 04:48:42.500
The Canadian Association of MAID assessors and providers acknowledges that patients who ingest assisted suicide drugs can experience burning, nausea, vomiting, and regurgitation, especially if the patient has difficulty swallowing large volumes of fluid.

1801
04:48:42.500 --> 04:48:51.000
Nausea, esophagitis, gastritis, severe T hydration, or pathology of gastrointestinal tract may interfere with the drug's absorption.

1802
04:48:51.000 --> 04:48:55.000
This is reflected in data by the U.S.

1803
04:48:55.000 --> 04:49:02.000
states, such as Oregon, where annual complication rates have been as high as 14.8%.

1804
04:49:02.000 --> 04:49:13.000
And patients are reported to have experienced difficulty swallowing or drug regurgitation seizures and have regained consciousness after ingesting these legal drugs.

1805
04:49:13.000 --> 04:49:18.500
That is not a peaceful death as far as I'm concerned.

1806
04:49:18.500 --> 04:49:26.500
It's also not a peaceful death for your family to watch if they're there with you.

1807
04:49:26.500 --> 04:49:28.500
Hospice.

1808
04:49:28.500 --> 04:49:32.000
You use hospice in talking about this.

1809
04:49:32.000 --> 04:49:34.000
Well, I contacted hospice.

1810
04:49:34.000 --> 04:49:42.500
I looked up the laws as far as Medicare is concerned, and I spoke with hospice agencies.

1811
04:49:42.500 --> 04:49:51.500
You say a person is eligible for hospice is one of the reasons why they can use this.

1812
04:49:51.500 --> 04:50:07.500
Well, in order to be eligible for hospice, okay, you have to have a terminal illness less than six months to live, but you also have to have a declining functional status.

1813
04:50:07.500 --> 04:50:48.000
You have to be less than 50 or 60 percent of the palliative performance scale the palliative performance scale is a fabulous scale you're 100 if you're walking around like we are today and then it goes down by your conditions i have copies of the scale here as well okay so to be to start off say you have reduced ambulation you're unable to do job work and significant disease, full self-care, normal or reduced intake, and full conscious level.

1814
04:50:48.000 --> 04:50:51.500
That would put you at a 70%.

1815
04:50:51.500 --> 04:50:58.000
You cannot use hospice for what you want and then not use hospice.

1816
04:50:58.000 --> 04:51:42.500
The other thing about hospice, in order to be qualified in the state of New Hampshire or for Medicare, now that's whether you have routine home care, general inpatient payer, continuous home care, or respite payer, in order to be considered for hospice, you have to have two physicians certify you for hospice one of those physicians has to be your diagnosed diagnosing position the other one has to be a hospice doctor nowhere in this bill does it mention anywhere where your diagnosing physician is involved in this.

1817
04:51:42.500 --> 04:51:47.000
The one who said you have a terminal illness.

1818
04:51:47.000 --> 04:51:52.000
The one who said you have six months to die.

1819
04:51:52.000 --> 04:51:57.500
Nowhere in here does it say you have to have information.

1820
04:51:57.500 --> 04:52:23.000
It says your medical records records work from where from your diagnosing physician or for someone you go to afterwards on the very um so i'm sorry to interrupt yeah representative but i i'm looking at m2 a prescribing health care provider page and number of page, starting at line 29.

1821
04:52:23.000 --> 04:52:25.500
This is on the amendment.

1822
04:52:25.500 --> 04:52:29.500
I mean, it's the same in the original.

1823
04:52:29.500 --> 04:52:31.500
It wasn't changed.

1824
04:52:31.500 --> 04:53:02.000
A prescribing health care provider may provide a prescription for medical diagnosis and dying medications to an individual only after the prescribing health care provider has determined that the individual has mental capacity, a terminal condition, prognosis of six months or less, or is medically certified or is enrolled in Medicare certified hospice, which meets the definition that you just said.

1825
04:53:02.000 --> 04:53:05.000
So that that is enrolled in.

1826
04:53:05.000 --> 04:53:07.000
Right in.

1827
04:53:07.000 --> 04:53:09.000
Right, is enrolled in.

1828
04:53:09.000 --> 04:53:16.000
And I thought that you said, as you read, what was required for enrollment.

1829
04:53:16.000 --> 04:53:18.500
Page two at the bottom.

1830
04:53:18.500 --> 04:53:20.500
Okay.

1831
04:53:20.500 --> 04:53:22.500
Determine is making decisions.

1832
04:53:22.500 --> 04:53:25.000
No, this is the amendment.

1833
04:53:25.000 --> 04:53:28.000
I don't see what you're saying.

1834
04:53:28.000 --> 04:53:30.000
Is enrolled in?

1835
04:53:30.000 --> 04:53:32.000
Has this the amendment?

1836
04:53:32.000 --> 04:53:36.000
Number C, M2, Roman numeral 1C, line 35.

1837
04:53:36.000 --> 04:53:38.000
Line 35.

1838
04:53:38.000 --> 04:53:40.000
Okay.

1839
04:53:40.000 --> 04:53:42.000
Thank you.

1840
04:53:42.000 --> 04:53:44.500
I'm on the original bill.

1841
04:53:44.500 --> 04:53:47.500
This part of it wasn't changed.

1842
04:53:47.500 --> 04:53:49.500
It's in the original.

1843
04:53:49.500 --> 04:54:11.000
I'm on'm on page two line 35 and it says dying medications that the individual requests in the original bill it is at hang on let's find it let me let me finish going through this quickly and I'm sure I'm across it.

1844
04:54:11.000 --> 04:54:13.000
Yeah, okay.

1845
04:54:13.000 --> 04:54:15.000
Online 20 page 2.

1846
04:54:15.000 --> 04:54:17.000
Reasonable medical judgment.

1847
04:54:17.000 --> 04:54:20.500
I looked up a reasonable medical judgment.

1848
04:54:20.500 --> 04:54:24.000
Is this documented in their health care?

1849
04:54:24.000 --> 04:54:29.000
Is it documented that they have six months to live?

1850
04:54:29.000 --> 04:54:56.000
Or are you going to a totally separate doctor, like the doctor that lives in New Hampshire who helps with Vermont, are you going to a totally separate doctor and you're telling that doctor, well, my doctor says, you know, I have this illness and, you know, according to statistics, I have less than.

1851
04:54:56.000 --> 04:55:03.500
There's nowhere that says you have to have, you're supposed to provide your medical record.

1852
04:55:03.500 --> 04:55:08.000
What medical record and where is it coming from?

1853
04:55:08.000 --> 04:55:10.000
I'll get to that.

1854
04:55:10.000 --> 04:55:12.000
Page three.

1855
04:55:12.000 --> 04:55:18.000
Nowhere is the six months documented from who's been your treating doctor.

1856
04:55:18.000 --> 04:55:20.500
Page three, line five, coercion.

1857
04:55:20.500 --> 04:55:22.500
Coercion, okay?

1858
04:55:22.500 --> 04:55:26.000
This is going to come up again.

1859
04:55:26.000 --> 04:55:32.000
Practice of persuading someone to do something is the definition of coercion.

1860
04:55:32.000 --> 04:56:28.500
How do we decide that somebody has or has not numbers number seven qualifies to receive wait a minute I lost my place nine through fourteen here we go confirmed and recorded in the individual's health record that at least one licensed physician not their diagnosing physician, not their treating physician, not whoever has treated them for five years for something, but any physician, osteopath, physician, advanced nurse, or physician assistants, I think you're going to take that out, after conducting an appropriate examination that the individual has capacity, a terminal illness, and the ability to self minister medical assistance in dying, that person may be prescribing health provider pursuant to this section.

1861
04:56:28.500 --> 04:56:41.000
so I can be treated for my lung cancer by a doctor for multiple years, but he has, I don't have to get his permission.

1862
04:56:41.000 --> 04:56:46.500
I don't have to use him at all to do this.

1863
04:56:46.500 --> 04:56:48.500
Okay, I'm moving on.

1864
04:56:48.500 --> 04:56:50.500
Coercion qualifies.

1865
04:56:50.500 --> 04:56:52.500
9 for 14.

1866
04:56:52.500 --> 04:56:54.500
Under under under.

1867
04:56:54.500 --> 04:56:56.500
Moving on.

1868
04:56:56.500 --> 04:56:58.500
Coercion qualifies.

1869
04:56:58.500 --> 04:57:06.500
9 through 14, under hospice, your health care provider has to be one of those people.

1870
04:57:06.500 --> 04:57:08.500
Page 5.

1871
04:57:08.500 --> 04:57:10.500
I do it all.

1872
04:57:10.500 --> 04:57:12.500
Wait a minute.

1873
04:57:12.500 --> 04:57:14.500
Hang on.

1874
04:57:14.500 --> 04:57:16.500
I apologize.

1875
04:57:16.500 --> 04:57:18.500
No, I'm sorry.

1876
04:57:18.500 --> 04:57:21.000
We're not having it coming.

1877
04:57:21.000 --> 04:57:25.500
As well as confirm that the individual meets her.

1878
04:57:25.500 --> 04:57:36.500
Also, there's no place in here that says that the person has to have stopped treatment for whatever they're being ailed for.

1879
04:57:36.500 --> 04:57:53.500
If you go into hospice, you no longer, not palliative care, but if you go into hospice, you can no longer be treated for that illness, for that diagnosis that you are dying from.

1880
04:57:53.500 --> 04:57:55.500
Number 22.

1881
04:57:55.500 --> 04:58:00.000
I'm sorry I'm losing track of where I am.

1882
04:58:00.000 --> 04:58:02.000
Postmas Board and Safety.

1883
04:58:02.000 --> 04:58:04.000
Relevant medical records.

1884
04:58:04.000 --> 04:58:06.000
What relative medical records?

1885
04:58:06.000 --> 04:58:12.000
Are they real are they your medical records from your treating physician?

1886
04:58:12.000 --> 04:58:16.500
It doesn't say medical records from your treating physician.

1887
04:58:16.500 --> 04:58:26.000
These are just little as a nurse for 42 years and dealing with people dying on a day-to-day basis.

1888
04:58:26.000 --> 04:58:53.500
These are things that need to be in here here peaceful manner I said it's not necessarily peaceful manner also there's the question of who pays for the meds are these meds covered under Medicare are they covered under my health insurance they also say three hours roughly it says in here somewhere about hours.

1889
04:58:53.500 --> 04:58:56.500
I've lost place where I am.

1890
04:58:56.500 --> 04:59:02.000
It can take up to 12 to 18 hours to die.

1891
04:59:02.000 --> 04:59:11.500
There's nothing in here, and it says, or longer, but if you read information, these people don't die quickly.

1892
04:59:11.500 --> 04:59:22.500
If you take a Tylenol and I take a Tylenol, it's going to affect you differently than it's going to affect me.

1893
04:59:22.500 --> 04:59:39.500
So to say that you're not pointing at you, Representative Devine, but if you give these meds to Representative Devine and she takes them and I take them, she may die in three hours.

1894
04:59:39.500 --> 04:59:46.500
I may be puking and vomiting and foaming at the mouth for 10 hours.

1895
04:59:46.500 --> 04:59:48.500
Peaceful manner.

1896
04:59:48.500 --> 04:59:50.500
Medical treatment guidelines.

1897
04:59:50.500 --> 04:59:53.500
Appropriate to embrace medical treatment guidelines.

1898
04:59:53.500 --> 04:59:56.500
You say that somewhere in here.

1899
04:59:56.500 --> 05:00:23.500
It says that, I think this is on page four peaceful manner 48 hours could be longer oh here's what it is why are we only saying 48 hours to give these meds to be able to pick up this prescription when Oregon and Hawaii Hawaii started out, they had theirs in 15 days.

1900
05:00:23.500 --> 05:00:26.000
They just recently changed it.

1901
05:00:26.000 --> 05:00:35.500
You want to put a new law into this state, but they can pick it up in 48 hours?

1902
05:00:35.500 --> 05:01:13.500
For Pete's sake, they've tried to get it so you can't pick up your gun that fast, but they want to do it for 48 hours why not 15 days why not people who have gone through this whole process why not allow them to time to sit back and think about it why not be conservative about that um I just want to make sure does this say that they have to make the decision?

1903
05:01:13.500 --> 05:01:16.000
No, they don't have to.

1904
05:01:16.000 --> 05:01:25.000
So if they decided 15 days or 30 days is what they want to wait, they can wait.

1905
05:01:25.000 --> 05:01:27.000
Right.

1906
05:01:27.000 --> 05:01:31.500
But why not give them the time to wait?

1907
05:01:31.500 --> 05:01:36.500
Why did other people put it in as 15 days?

1908
05:01:36.500 --> 05:01:38.500
Telehealth.

1909
05:01:38.500 --> 05:01:42.500
I really have a huge issue with telehealth.

1910
05:01:42.500 --> 05:01:45.000
You want me Thank you.

1911
05:01:45.000 --> 05:01:49.000
put it in as 15 days, 15 days.

1912
05:01:49.000 --> 05:01:51.000
Telehealth.

1913
05:01:51.000 --> 05:01:55.000
I really have a huge issue with telehealth.

1914
05:01:55.000 --> 05:02:02.500
You want me to go and I'm a doctor and you're on a screen, okay?

1915
05:02:02.500 --> 05:02:04.500
Telehealth.

1916
05:02:04.500 --> 05:02:06.500
Who's behind me?

1917
05:02:06.500 --> 05:02:25.000
Who's behind you holding that gun saying, I know you think that wouldn't happen, but you know, I said to my husband, I said, so you're, you're getting to be too much of a burden for me.

1918
05:02:25.000 --> 05:02:27.000
Okay.

1919
05:02:27.000 --> 05:02:30.000
You're too much of a burden.

1920
05:02:30.000 --> 05:02:33.000
I can't do it anymore, John.

1921
05:02:33.000 --> 05:02:35.500
Too much of a burden.

1922
05:02:35.500 --> 05:02:37.500
Let's get on telehealth.

1923
05:02:37.500 --> 05:02:41.500
Oh, I don't want to do that, Christine.

1924
05:02:41.500 --> 05:02:51.000
Well, let me put my, my brand new gun right to your back to make sure you do it.

1925
05:02:51.000 --> 05:02:53.000
I mean, really telehealth.

1926
05:02:53.000 --> 05:03:19.500
Are don't want to do that Christine well let me put my my brand new gun right to your back to make sure you do it I mean really telehealth are you kidding me page 5 who are seeing that's again okay page 530 number 30 I have a real problem with this.

1927
05:03:19.500 --> 05:03:21.500
A real problem.

1928
05:03:21.500 --> 05:03:25.500
It says that nobody can be criminally liable.

1929
05:03:25.500 --> 05:03:31.500
Why are we saying that doctors cannot be criminally liable for this?

1930
05:03:31.500 --> 05:03:37.500
Why do we say that they, what if we have a quack?

1931
05:03:37.500 --> 05:03:43.000
I mean, doctors are human too, just like lawyers and stuff.

1932
05:03:43.000 --> 05:03:53.000
What if we have a couple of doctors that are going to open up a clinic and start doing this?

1933
05:03:53.000 --> 05:03:57.000
Criminally liable, that's why they carry melfast insurance.

1934
05:03:57.000 --> 05:04:09.000
They need to be criminally liable if they do something that shouldn't be done according to this law and specifically cause a person's death.

1935
05:04:09.000 --> 05:04:11.000
Page number six.

1936
05:04:11.000 --> 05:04:13.000
I spoke at length.

1937
05:04:13.000 --> 05:04:16.500
Six through nine, I think it is.

1938
05:04:16.500 --> 05:04:18.500
Page number six.

1939
05:04:18.500 --> 05:04:20.500
Sorry.

1940
05:04:20.500 --> 05:04:22.500
Six.

1941
05:04:22.500 --> 05:04:24.500
About insurance.

1942
05:04:24.500 --> 05:04:26.500
Okay.

1943
05:04:26.500 --> 05:04:28.500
Page number six.

1944
05:04:28.500 --> 05:04:30.500
Six through nine.

1945
05:04:30.500 --> 05:04:33.500
I lost my place on it.

1946
05:04:33.500 --> 05:04:37.500
Okay, I'm going to talk about health insurance.

1947
05:04:37.500 --> 05:04:39.500
About insurance.

1948
05:04:39.500 --> 05:04:44.000
Do we have a right to dictate health insurance?

1949
05:04:44.000 --> 05:04:48.000
I don't think we do with this law.

1950
05:04:48.000 --> 05:04:52.500
No health care entity or health insurer is subject.

1951
05:04:52.500 --> 05:05:01.000
We don't have a right to talk about health insurance and what they can and cannot do.

1952
05:05:01.000 --> 05:05:12.000
Number 22 through number 26, a health care entity may sanction a health care provider for participating in medical assistance and dying.

1953
05:05:12.000 --> 05:05:22.000
I understand that these health care, this all, we have a page, a page and a half protecting the doctor.

1954
05:05:22.000 --> 05:05:25.500
Specifically protecting the doctor from doing this.

1955
05:05:25.500 --> 05:05:32.000
A page and a half in a seven-page bill or a nine-page bill.

1956
05:05:32.000 --> 05:05:37.500
On page seven, and don't think I just did this myself.

1957
05:05:37.500 --> 05:05:40.000
I talked to insurance people.

1958
05:05:40.000 --> 05:05:42.500
I talked to hospice nurses.

1959
05:05:42.500 --> 05:05:44.500
I talked to doctors.

1960
05:05:44.500 --> 05:05:52.000
I talked, literally talked to a dentist because I said, are you covered on this?

1961
05:05:52.000 --> 05:05:54.500
He says, I absolutely am.

1962
05:05:54.500 --> 05:05:57.500
Page number seven, seven through ten.

1963
05:05:57.500 --> 05:06:13.000
Why are we not putting this as suicide or assistance suicide it the definition the definition i'm sorry my pages got all messed up number three was that one the definitions.

1964
05:06:13.000 --> 05:06:15.000
Suicide.

1965
05:06:15.000 --> 05:06:36.000
The act of killing oneself intentionally assisted suicide assisted suicide suicide affected affected with the absence of another person especially the taking of lethal drugs provided by a doctor for the purpose by a patient with a terminal illness or incurable condition.

1966
05:06:36.000 --> 05:06:38.500
That is assisted suicide's definition.

1967
05:06:38.500 --> 05:06:49.000
Assisted suicide, a procedure in which people take medication to end their lives with the help of others, usually medical professionals.

1968
05:06:49.000 --> 05:07:02.500
This practice differs from euthanasia, also called mercy killing, in which a medical professional painlessly ends a terminally ill suffering by withholding or removing life support treatment.

1969
05:07:02.500 --> 05:07:17.500
People often request assistance suicide because of a chronic or acute physical or mental condition that is so affected their quality of life they no longer which wish to live.

1970
05:07:17.500 --> 05:07:21.000
So why are we not calling this?

1971
05:07:21.000 --> 05:07:36.500
Why does it say that it can't be called and why is it not why is it not on I'm not gonna get to that yet page 8 page number 10.

1972
05:07:36.500 --> 05:07:43.000
How do you know who took this medication if there is no witness?

1973
05:07:43.000 --> 05:07:49.500
How do you know who took this medication if there is no witness?

1974
05:07:49.500 --> 05:07:51.500
Okay.

1975
05:07:51.500 --> 05:07:57.000
What if I move out of the state with this medication?

1976
05:07:57.000 --> 05:08:00.000
There's no way to track this.

1977
05:08:00.000 --> 05:08:11.500
you have to be able to have it say that the person utilized MAID as part of their death certificate to track this.

1978
05:08:11.500 --> 05:08:25.500
And also, not just to track it for how many people do it or this or that, but if I have terminal cancer, I have skin cancer, okay?

1979
05:08:25.500 --> 05:08:28.000
A terminal skin cancer, okay?

1980
05:08:28.000 --> 05:08:37.000
It is also necessary because physicians or agencies use it to track the life expectancy for different ailments.

1981
05:08:37.000 --> 05:08:39.000
For different ailments.

1982
05:08:39.000 --> 05:08:42.000
They need how a person died.

1983
05:08:42.000 --> 05:09:06.000
If you put that the person died on this day from their terminal illness but they could possibly have lived longer and you don't put on it made then they have no way that skews everything that people are trying to keep track of um okay number insurance.

1984
05:09:06.000 --> 05:09:09.000
I spoke to two insurance agencies.

1985
05:09:09.000 --> 05:09:12.500
Why do we have accidents insurance here?

1986
05:09:12.500 --> 05:09:19.000
What does accident insurance have to do with this bill, a MAID bill?

1987
05:09:19.000 --> 05:09:21.000
Why is that there?

1988
05:09:21.000 --> 05:09:36.500
Is it that later down the road, in case we want to add, if somebody's in a motor vehicle accident and then they have intractable pain, we can add them easier.

1989
05:09:36.500 --> 05:09:40.000
Why is an annuity policy listed here?

1990
05:09:40.000 --> 05:09:48.000
As far as life insurance policies are concerned, we cannot, that's reflecting right in my eye.

1991
05:09:48.000 --> 05:09:50.000
That's okay.

1992
05:09:50.000 --> 05:09:59.500
We cannot go to insurance, if you have life insurance, most life insurances have a two-year waiting period, okay?

1993
05:09:59.500 --> 05:10:07.000
A two-year waiting period for any death and specifically a two-year waiting period for suicide.

1994
05:10:07.000 --> 05:10:19.500
We cannot dictate to insurance companies that you took out an insurance bill a year ago and you did this, but you have to pay.

1995
05:10:19.500 --> 05:10:22.500
No, you don't have to pay.

1996
05:10:22.500 --> 05:10:28.500
We can't dictate to the insurance company that they have to pay.

1997
05:10:28.500 --> 05:10:35.000
On last page, what is the law in New Hampshire on page five?

1998
05:10:35.000 --> 05:10:48.000
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the prescribing provider may sign the death certificate of a qualified individual who obtained and self-administered a prescription for medications pursuant.

1999
05:10:48.000 --> 05:10:50.000
What is the law?

2000
05:10:50.000 --> 05:10:52.500
I know a nurse practitioner.

2001
05:10:52.500 --> 05:11:00.000
I do not believe a nurse can sign a death certificate, but I'm not sure.

2002
05:11:00.000 --> 05:11:09.500
Why isn't it okay for MAID to be as on the death certificate as the secondary cause of death?

2003
05:11:09.500 --> 05:11:11.500
Anyway, that's...

2004
05:11:11.500 --> 05:11:13.500
I did literally...

2005
05:11:13.500 --> 05:11:18.500
on the death certificate as the secondary cause of death.

2006
05:11:18.500 --> 05:11:24.000
Anyway, that's, I did literally go through this line by line.

2007
05:11:24.000 --> 05:11:27.000
I have a lot of concern.

2008
05:11:27.000 --> 05:11:31.500
I'm not talking about the intent of the bill.

2009
05:11:31.500 --> 05:11:37.000
This has nothing to do with the intent of the bill.

2010
05:11:37.000 --> 05:11:42.500
If you want a bill for assisted made, I get it.

2011
05:11:42.500 --> 05:12:46.000
This has to do with do with this bill has so many loopholes and so many loosey-goosey things that can be challenged that i do not feel the thing that you all like to use that i've heard since i've been here is it's not fit for prime time all right all right thank you as uh as i said i i didn't really want to end up having a debate on this today because we're not going to vote on it today but does anybody else have anything they want to say before i move on to things that we are going to vote on today yes representative stable thank you mr chair um thank you you, Representative Perez, for going through this in such detail.

2012
05:12:46.000 --> 05:13:21.500
It points out how this assisted suicide or prescription suicide is such a radical departure from our basis in law that protects the individual and holds life important and in sanctity you can formulate law with additional pages and qualifications and you probably can even make it perfect if we had enough time to do that however we're still the essential question is why to go here in the first place.

2013
05:13:21.500 --> 05:13:26.500
Some people have testified that this is a slippery slope.

2014
05:13:26.500 --> 05:13:29.500
No, it's not a slippery slope.

2015
05:13:29.500 --> 05:13:32.500
It's a step off the precipice.

2016
05:13:32.500 --> 05:13:42.500
It's an abandonment of hope, abandonment of trust in the developing care that we have in hospice and palliative care.

2017
05:13:42.500 --> 05:13:48.500
It misses a connection between those two things and the assisted suicide.

2018
05:13:48.500 --> 05:13:50.500
Six months?

2019
05:13:50.500 --> 05:13:55.000
Well, what if it was seven or eight months?

2020
05:13:55.000 --> 05:14:01.500
What if it was three or four months of a terminal diagnosis estimate?

2021
05:14:01.500 --> 05:14:04.000
And it is an estimate.

2022
05:14:04.000 --> 05:14:20.500
I mean, how many people have been diagnosed as being terminal, and you got a year to live, or you have whatever you have, and then they live for seven or eight years?

2023
05:14:20.500 --> 05:14:27.500
We have developing medical progress that's always finding new ways, new medicines, new cures.

2024
05:14:27.500 --> 05:14:38.500
And to take that pill, as far as I'm concerned, is an abandonment of trust in God and an abandonment of hope.

2025
05:14:38.500 --> 05:15:08.500
And ignoring the realization that we have developing medical progress and that we have fine and developing and improving hospice and palliative care for those of us on a religious basis there's no way we can subscribe to suicide that's an abandonment of hope and trust in God and entrusting his design which is inherent and healing in human beings.

2026
05:15:08.500 --> 05:15:17.500
Yes, we have doctors and we have medicals, but the human body has been designed to heal itself.

2027
05:15:17.500 --> 05:15:22.500
We need to trust in some of these basic principles.

2028
05:15:22.500 --> 05:15:27.000
Call them religious, call them ethics, if you will.

2029
05:15:27.000 --> 05:16:09.000
But this is a step over the line this is dangerous territory i can't vote for this bill even if there's 70 or 80 percent of people think it's a good idea i cannot do it all right representative alexander thank you mr chair i have a question of the sponsors of the amendment i think represent perez brought up a good point a lot of good points but one of the ones at the end was on page 9, lines 10 through 11.

2030
05:16:09.000 --> 05:16:17.000
A qualified individual who had obtained and self-administered a prescription for medications pursuant to this chapter.

2031
05:16:17.000 --> 05:16:21.500
How do we know that the medication was self-administered?

2032
05:16:21.500 --> 05:16:30.500
Is there any language in here to show that there's a witness seeing the administration of the medicine?

2033
05:16:30.500 --> 05:16:44.000
And if we don't know it's being self-administered, I would encourage you to strike that out because that could lead to a huge problem if you don't.

2034
05:16:44.000 --> 05:17:02.000
because nobody if if nobody's there to see that that medication was self-administered and then later in section, you say that death following self-administration medications on this chapter does not constitute grounds for a post-mortem inquiry.

2035
05:17:02.000 --> 05:17:12.000
It's basically saying you can, you don't have, like nobody has to be there to see that it's being self-administered.

2036
05:17:12.000 --> 05:17:15.000
And then you can't even check.

2037
05:17:15.000 --> 05:17:56.000
You can't even check because on here, it says that no grounds for post-mortem inquiry so i guess that's my question for you like i know this is an amendment i would consider if if you want to pass something with language like this i'd consider you at least revise that part that's some very problematic language all right anybody else have anything said all right so i'm gonna uh uh move on then on then to where we left off on.

2038
05:17:56.000 --> 05:17:58.000
Pardon?

2039
05:17:58.000 --> 05:18:00.000
My amendment?

2040
05:18:00.000 --> 05:18:15.000
When you speak to your amendment, we're not going to be voting on this today, but if you want, I suppose, if you want to quickly speak to your amendment.

2041
05:18:15.000 --> 05:18:18.500
I will quickly speak to my amendment.

2042
05:18:18.500 --> 05:18:27.000
The reason why I have this amendment that we, suicide is among, among ages 10 to 34.

2043
05:18:27.000 --> 05:18:31.000
Suicide is the number two cause of death.

2044
05:18:31.000 --> 05:18:40.500
unintentional injury is number one this is in New Hampshire and suicide is the number two cause of death.

2045
05:18:40.500 --> 05:18:43.000
Unintentional injury is number one.

2046
05:18:43.000 --> 05:18:45.500
This is in New Hampshire.

2047
05:18:45.500 --> 05:18:48.500
And suicide is the number two.

2048
05:18:48.500 --> 05:19:08.500
We had two teenagers come and speak to us, which really hit home with me, because I hadn't thought of it that way, who spoke about how they were concerned about their peers who felt that their depression was terminal.

2049
05:19:08.500 --> 05:19:32.500
And by allowing a bill like the one, like 1283, that it would, granted they're not, they can't use this bill, but it would certainly make them feel as though they had a legitimate, oh, the government says you can do this, so why can't I do this?

2050
05:19:32.500 --> 05:19:43.500
Our Suicide Prevention Council on Suicide, it's to hereby establish the Council on Suicide Prevention to put together a suicide prevention plan.

2051
05:19:43.500 --> 05:19:54.500
As far as I'm concerned, we might as well just get rid of it because you can't allow suicide and prevent suicide.

2052
05:19:54.500 --> 05:19:59.500
The United States is a strong policy of suicide prevention.

2053
05:19:59.500 --> 05:20:36.500
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognize that suicide is a serious health, public health problem and a leading cause of death in the United States suicide and suicide attempts cause serious emotional physical and economic impacts in suicide survivors loved ones and community according to the CDC the financial toll of suicide on society is also costly in 2019 suicide and non-fatal self-harm cost the nation nearly $490 billion in medical costs.

2054
05:20:36.500 --> 05:20:39.500
So that's one of the reasons.

2055
05:20:39.500 --> 05:20:51.500
And then also the practice, the practice, this practice of assisted suicide undermines the suicide prevention policy and increases the rates of non-assisted suicide.

2056
05:20:51.500 --> 05:21:00.000
Congress and the states, however, have broad powers to prevent human dignity at the end of life.

2057
05:21:00.000 --> 05:21:16.000
So therefore, I cannot justify, I think it's ludicrous and almost a farce to continue to have the Council on Suicide Prevention and also have a bill that is allowing end-of-life options.

2058
05:21:16.000 --> 05:21:18.000
All right.

2059
05:21:18.000 --> 05:21:21.000
Are we ready to move on?

2060
05:21:21.000 --> 05:21:28.000
Let's move on to, I think, where we left off on House Bill 1037.

2061
05:21:28.000 --> 05:21:31.500
I don't know if we need to.

2062
05:21:31.500 --> 05:21:39.500
I scheduled them all for executive session, so I don't think we need to do that.

2063
05:21:39.500 --> 05:21:42.500
I'm going to move on to.

2064
05:21:42.500 --> 05:21:44.500
Somebody want.

2065
05:21:44.500 --> 05:21:46.500
Oh, sure.

2066
05:21:46.500 --> 05:21:51.000
Yeah, let's take why don't we take five minutes?

2067
05:21:51.000 --> 05:21:53.000
Is that all right?

2068
05:21:53.000 --> 05:21:56.000
We'll take a five minute recess.

2069
05:21:56.000 --> 05:21:58.000
I gotta stand up.

2070
05:21:58.000 --> 05:22:00.500
Let me go right here.

2071
05:22:00.500 --> 05:22:02.500
Thank you.

2072
05:22:02.500 --> 05:22:04.500
Thank you.

2073
05:22:04.500 --> 05:22:06.500
Thank you.

2074
05:22:06.500 --> 05:22:08.500
Thank you.

2075
05:22:08.500 --> 05:22:10.500
Thank you.

2076
05:22:10.500 --> 05:22:12.500
Thank you.

2077
05:22:12.500 --> 05:22:14.500
Thank you.

2078
05:22:14.500 --> 05:23:51.000
all right all right so we're waiting for uh we're waiting waiting for uh representative katab and i say that with oh she's right here in jest i mean i i don't have questions to her because i you know i will defer to her background she's going to identify things that i would right right right no exactly that's that's i mean that's the thing it's not she already said when i asked her before there's not anything you could do that would make the course or what you know i know what i get i mean maybe that's the seal because of the subject matter right right right sure sure maybe we need to have a little bit of training as far as right right right right sure sure maybe they have a little bit better training as far as what does this all sorry right right right right right now you're what that what that in the past all right um all right yeah we're waiting for i'm waiting for representative page and representative uh greece oh page and greece pages was right here well I think we're offsetting penalties.

2079
05:23:51.000 --> 05:23:53.000
You never know.

2080
05:23:53.000 --> 05:23:55.000
Right.

2081
05:23:55.000 --> 05:24:05.000
Someone said to me the other day, don't they have a person, however, the vice chair or the ranking general?

2082
05:24:05.000 --> 05:24:07.000
Those are suggestions.

2083
05:24:07.000 --> 05:24:10.000
Just like soft signs and revelations.

2084
05:24:10.000 --> 05:24:12.000
Right.

2085
05:24:12.000 --> 05:24:14.000
Suggestions.

2086
05:24:14.000 --> 05:24:16.000
I suppose.

2087
05:24:16.000 --> 05:24:18.000
Yeah, yeah.

2088
05:24:18.000 --> 05:24:20.000
No, that's.

2089
05:24:20.000 --> 05:24:22.000
That is ten.

2090
05:24:22.000 --> 05:24:48.000
That's one of those pages of things that people don I think we have everybody I think we have everybody back so I don't know whether I need to do this or not but I just for the record I'm going to recess the hearing on 12 83 and we'll resume that.

2091
05:24:48.000 --> 05:24:51.500
I'm not the hearing, the executive session.

2092
05:24:51.500 --> 05:24:55.000
And we'll resume that on March 6th.

2093
05:24:55.000 --> 05:24:59.500
So now I'd like to turn to HB 1037.

2094
05:24:59.500 --> 05:25:05.500
As I recall, and Representative Katab, if I'm wrong, please correct me.

2095
05:25:05.500 --> 05:26:31.500
But I believe when we broke from our last executive session on that bill, we had on representative tur's amendment and that failed on the 10 to 10 vote and then before we moved on to anything else we we recessed sorry he was through his motion and represented Smith had withdrawn her second on the amendment so the the adoption of the amendment had failed 10 to 10 and then we the vote had not been called on the other motion so it was okay that we left it but now there's nothing essentially on the table so any motion can be put in at this point is what i've been told the amendment um could only be revisited if we took a vote to reconsider and the reconsideration vote prevailed then the amendment can be reconsidered otherwise it's already been voted on all right so um so representative smith thank you in terms of uh amendment to bill 1037 with no amendment now before us, I would move interim study.

2096
05:26:31.500 --> 05:26:33.500
Is there a second?

2097
05:26:33.500 --> 05:27:07.000
TO BILL 1037 WITH NO AMENDMENT NOW BEFORE US I WOULD MOVE INTERIM STUDY IS THERE A SECOND SECOND ALL RIGHT THEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOUR MOTION REPRESENTATIVE SMITH YES THE BILL REPEALS THE STATUTE THAT PROVIDES LIMITED LIABILITY TO MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTERS DEALERS or in The bill repeals the statute that provides limited liability to manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunitions.

2098
05:27:07.000 --> 05:27:18.500
It is a bill that is very close to the hearts of many members of the House, some in support and some opposed.

2099
05:27:18.500 --> 05:27:37.000
We know that the industry is very important in the state of New Hampshire in terms of employment and in terms of, to the limited extent that we still have some business taxes, in terms of revenue.

2100
05:27:37.000 --> 05:28:02.000
We also know that we are living at a time when, at a rate that cannot please anyone, weapons are being used in a way where neither the manufacturers nor most responsible gun owners support in terms of, let's not go past last week when the Super Bowl parade erupted.

2101
05:28:02.000 --> 05:28:12.000
And it was interesting to me that at the beginning, the police told us that the people involved were juveniles.

2102
05:28:12.000 --> 05:28:16.000
In fact, it turns out that they weren't.

2103
05:28:16.000 --> 05:28:40.500
They were adults who were having a fight and just pulled out their respective guns because they had access and shot not just at each other, but at almost two dozen other people, including children, any number of whom are still hospitalized because of the extent of their injuries.

2104
05:28:40.500 --> 05:28:48.500
I don't think anybody at Sig Sauer or any place else wants to see children injured.

2105
05:28:48.500 --> 05:28:59.000
But there has to be some way to acknowledge that we might have some things a little bit out of control.

2106
05:28:59.000 --> 05:29:10.000
In addition, I would go back to something that our colleague, Representative Perez, talked about, and that is the use of guns.

2107
05:29:10.000 --> 05:29:35.500
I don't want to just say weapons, but the use of guns in suicide because they are available in so many households to both adults and children, although I'm sure they're not available to children in homes where people take seriously the need to hold their weapons in a secure way.

2108
05:29:35.500 --> 05:29:39.500
There are just a lot of factors here.

2109
05:29:39.500 --> 05:30:28.500
And rather than add to the smoke about the issue and rather than add to a rallying cry about, yes, we should do everything we can to promote the industry, and no, we shouldn't allow any guns in the country, and we should hold gun manufacturers accountable for things that they themselves did not participate in, I would like to take a time out and have us look at the bill and see if it's possible to come up with something where people on both sides, on all sides of this issue, might find a little common ground.

2110
05:30:28.500 --> 05:30:39.500
I, as you know, tend to bend over backwards to ignore traditional divisions, R's and D's, gun owners and not gun owners.

2111
05:30:39.500 --> 05:30:48.000
I believe that there's a middle ground that if we work together, we could get to yes.

2112
05:30:48.000 --> 05:31:09.500
And rather than have kind of a knee-jerk reaction with everybody on one side voting one way and everybody on the other side voting another, I would like to see if we could come up with a reasonable, modest approach to the issue.

2113
05:31:09.500 --> 05:31:51.000
And because of that, I would move interim study, even though I'm the first person to say do you realize that that means that you're going to get stuck on the interim study committee and i i do and i think the issue is important enough for me to be willing to do that so that's why i support interim study all right representative horgan i've i was a co-sponsor of this bill and I co-sponsored a similar bill a few years ago.

2114
05:31:51.000 --> 05:31:57.000
That time, that was when Representative Kathy Rogers was still with us.

2115
05:31:57.000 --> 05:33:13.000
And I think the gun industry is a major employer in this state, and actually I haven't really heard of threatening that explicitly to move out of the state if we if we actually pass this bill because um they have especially six hour who are located the next town over from myself and revenue smith at newington but also there's several other major gun manufacturers i think they um i mean i think they have at least i think basically they're trying to be reasonable and they recognize their products are dangerous and actually in case of sick sour i think they primarily market towards uh uh the police the law enforcement market uh the like private security market especially the military market so they're not actually i mean they do make some attempt to market, you know, just people like the firearm lifestyle, but that's actually not their primary business.

2116
05:33:13.000 --> 05:33:24.500
So I think they're not necessarily Second Amendment extremists, although they certainly, I mean, certainly we'd like to have fewer regulations than more.

2117
05:33:24.500 --> 05:33:32.000
And also in the case of Sig Sauer, they have an ongoing product liability issue.

2118
05:33:32.000 --> 05:33:40.000
And actually, I had a long conversation a few weeks ago with the government relations person.

2119
05:33:40.000 --> 05:33:57.000
He had what sounded like a fairly reasonable explanation, which was partially that they have offered modifications to a particular very popular line of pistols, which many people have accidentally shot themselves while using.

2120
05:33:57.000 --> 05:34:04.000
And they do have a modification, which many gun owners have taken advantage of.

2121
05:34:04.000 --> 05:34:06.000
Some haven't.

2122
05:34:06.000 --> 05:34:16.500
And most of the law enforcement, military, and security personnel actually asked for that modification to put a safety catch on.

2123
05:34:16.500 --> 05:35:10.000
At least that's that's my recollection the conversation they haven't chosen to participate in this debate so you can take that with a grain of grain of salt if you want to but I um so I think I think they're the they're really the only industry that has like a blanket immunity like that and I don't think that's appropriate and I'm really I'm too optimistic, but I'm not convinced they would like just, they and the other manufacturers would get up and moved across the border to Maine or Vermont or wherever else, because they have hundreds of millions of dollars invested in our community.

2124
05:35:10.000 --> 05:35:16.000
They've got a specialized workforce that likes living here and working here.

2125
05:35:16.000 --> 05:35:21.000
And so I don't think they're going to pick up.

2126
05:35:21.000 --> 05:35:35.000
I don't, if I thought they were going to pick up and move and throw all those people out of work, I would not have co-sponsored the bill.

2127
05:35:35.000 --> 05:35:42.500
But that's, so I, you know, so I'm probably going to vote against the interim.

2128
05:35:42.500 --> 05:35:50.500
I would prefer like off to pass, obviously, and I'll probably just vote against interim study.

2129
05:35:50.500 --> 05:36:18.000
Although I think that a pretty that's certainly more positive result than what i was expecting which was that it would be it held so i think all right so thank you representative turn can i first ask um has representative smith's motion been seconded yet yes they were seconded by representative page Oh, okay.

2130
05:36:18.000 --> 05:36:20.000
Sorry.

2131
05:36:20.000 --> 05:36:22.000
Missed Page.

2132
05:36:22.000 --> 05:36:24.000
Okay, sorry, missed that.

2133
05:36:24.000 --> 05:36:31.500
Just coming back around to, I think, echo some of what Representative Smith was saying.

2134
05:36:31.500 --> 05:38:04.000
Obviously, I put forward an amendment that I thought was an attempt to, rather than move completely to a full repeal of the bill, an attempt to make a what i thought was very more modest um adjustment to the underlying bill um uh maybe i'll speak to that when we actually have a motion um other if depending on where this motion goes to but i think in in general um i want to say that was one attempt at fixing or amending what I think are some real issues with the immunity law the way that it's stated, because it actually allows people to claim in the gun industry an exemption that no other industry has, even if they are found by a jury to have committed a felony by the same standard that a civil claim would be would be brought on so um i think the interim study would be a useful exercise to see whether or not we can find a better way forward and i hope that we would support it all right anyone else wish to be heard?

2135
05:38:04.000 --> 05:38:06.000
Representative Greeson.

2136
05:38:06.000 --> 05:38:20.000
I don't know how we can hold the manufacturers, distributors, dealers, or importers of firearms or ammunition responsible for the actions of the consumer that purchased said firearm.

2137
05:38:20.000 --> 05:38:32.500
I've heard that this immunity – there's no other corporation or enterprise that is granted such immunity, and yet there is one that has immunity.

2138
05:38:32.500 --> 05:38:42.500
And I remembered hearing during testimony that this immunity that the firearms manufacturers have means they don't have to innovate.

2139
05:38:42.500 --> 05:38:55.000
Flip that around and insert the word vaccine manufacturer, and you will find that they do have immunity beyond even what the firearms manufacturers have.

2140
05:38:55.000 --> 05:39:08.500
and not only do they have immunity, it's at the federal level that they have this immunity such that they don't even have to acknowledge that the...

2141
05:39:08.500 --> 05:39:36.000
And not only do they have immunity, it's at the federal level that they have this immunity such that they don't even have to acknowledge that their product is defective in any way or caused any kind of injury at all, even after this vaccine court has determined that somebody was injured by the product.

2142
05:39:36.000 --> 05:39:44.000
They are granted this immunity was granted to the vaccine manufacturers because they were being sued.

2143
05:39:44.000 --> 05:39:49.000
And because there was no innovation, that was the fear.

2144
05:39:49.000 --> 05:39:53.500
They're getting sued, so they're not going to innovate.

2145
05:39:53.500 --> 05:39:57.000
So we need to give them immunity.

2146
05:39:57.000 --> 05:40:04.000
Now we're being told that this immunity is causing a manufacturer not to innovate.

2147
05:40:04.000 --> 05:40:07.500
So you can't have it both ways.

2148
05:40:07.500 --> 05:40:27.000
I just don't see how in the world I can't hold them responsible for the actions of the individual who purchased the weapon any more than I can hold any other business accountable for your actions or my actions.

2149
05:40:27.000 --> 05:40:29.000
Representative Stapleton.

2150
05:40:29.000 --> 05:40:32.500
Yeah, we have a gun problem here.

2151
05:40:32.500 --> 05:40:38.000
We have, well, not a gun problem, but a behavior problem.

2152
05:40:38.000 --> 05:40:44.500
We've got to do something about the wanton, reckless, irresponsible use of firearms.

2153
05:40:44.500 --> 05:40:48.500
But this is not the bill for that.

2154
05:40:48.500 --> 05:40:56.500
taking and hammering the gun manufacturers for personal irresponsibility and reckless use is apples and oranges.

2155
05:40:56.500 --> 05:41:00.500
And it's going to have a harmful effect.

2156
05:41:00.500 --> 05:41:04.500
After the Sandy Hook massacre, Remington was sued.

2157
05:41:04.500 --> 05:41:08.000
I forget the amount of the judgment.

2158
05:41:08.000 --> 05:41:15.000
they're in the bankruptcy and they're just closing their plant in Ileon, New York.

2159
05:41:15.000 --> 05:41:24.000
What, a couple of hundred employees going to go out without work in a town of about 7,600.

2160
05:41:24.000 --> 05:41:38.500
If we replicate that here, we've got Sig Sauer and we've got Ruger and maybe a couple other smaller manufacturers and maybe support industries as well that support these.

2161
05:41:38.500 --> 05:41:42.000
We're just hammering the wrong party here.

2162
05:41:42.000 --> 05:41:55.000
We need perhaps a bill that addresses irresponsible and reckless use of firearms with some civil and criminal penalties added to the law, crimes with guns.

2163
05:41:55.000 --> 05:42:37.000
Any number of innovative ideas can be applied to creating legislation and a law, but hammering the gun manufacturers with the loss of the immunity is just not the way to go it's just going to create a harmful effect here and any other anyone else representative for it um a question for you representative smith do you have any idea of what you might want to put to change to make this um to change this bill if we had an interim study?

2164
05:42:37.000 --> 05:42:41.500
I mean, did you have any ideas at all?

2165
05:42:41.500 --> 05:42:48.000
If I knew the answer, I would have come forward with an amendment.

2166
05:42:48.000 --> 05:43:05.500
My point is that there are 20 people on this committee, I believe overwhelmingly people of goodwill, faced with a challenge to see if there's a way forward that we would put our heads together.

2167
05:43:05.500 --> 05:43:15.500
If that assumption is wrong, then that will be reflected in a refusal to support the concept of interim study.

2168
05:43:15.500 --> 05:43:18.500
I guess that answers the question.

2169
05:43:18.500 --> 05:43:20.500
Follow it?

2170
05:43:20.500 --> 05:43:22.500
Yes.

2171
05:43:22.500 --> 05:43:34.000
Do you happen to know if the two men that shot at the thing were legal gun owners or not legal gun owners?

2172
05:43:34.000 --> 05:43:42.500
Because I think we're dealing with, we have 82.88 million legal gun owners in the United States.

2173
05:43:42.500 --> 05:43:47.000
I actually thought the number was higher than that.

2174
05:43:47.000 --> 05:43:49.500
Oh, that's how many owners.

2175
05:43:49.500 --> 05:43:55.000
But you can't really tell because everybody has different gun laws.

2176
05:43:55.000 --> 05:44:00.500
I personally don't think we have a problem with gun owners.

2177
05:44:00.500 --> 05:44:05.500
I think we have a problem with illegal gun owners.

2178
05:44:05.500 --> 05:44:10.000
I think we have a problem with mental health.

2179
05:44:10.000 --> 05:44:16.500
Most of the people that go out and kill have mental health problems.

2180
05:44:16.500 --> 05:44:22.500
Chicago has tightest, Illinois has the tightest gun laws in the nation.

2181
05:44:22.500 --> 05:44:54.500
They have shootouts with illegal guns over the weekend, constantly in some of the highest highest i said hurting the manufacturer and the legal seller let's go after the ones that have them illegal and those with mental health problems is my opinion so anyone else have anything they want to say representative staples within the last two weeks we had two shootings inaremont.

2182
05:44:54.500 --> 05:44:56.500
Fortunately, nobody was killed.

2183
05:44:56.500 --> 05:44:59.000
A ranger on Front Street.

2184
05:44:59.000 --> 05:45:05.000
Some kids were rifling through automobiles or attempting to get into them.

2185
05:45:05.000 --> 05:45:10.000
And an owner fired a shot to dispel the activity.

2186
05:45:10.000 --> 05:45:12.500
He's been called into justice.

2187
05:45:12.500 --> 05:45:21.000
And just yesterday, there was a road rage incident in front of Cumberland Farms on Pleasant Street.

2188
05:45:21.000 --> 05:45:27.500
Guy pulls out a gun and fires it at his road rage opponent.

2189
05:45:27.500 --> 05:45:33.500
Fortunately, the bullet didn't hit anybody, including innocent bystanders, but could have.

2190
05:45:33.500 --> 05:45:43.500
The manufacturers have nothing to do with these two cases or thousands of other cases of reckless and irresponsible use.

2191
05:45:43.500 --> 05:45:51.000
Both of the individuals in this case are being brought to justice under existing law.

2192
05:45:51.000 --> 05:46:18.000
And if anything, we could maybe strengthen it, but it needs a separate law reckless irresponsible use of firearms and civil and criminal penalties added to what we have on the statute crime with guns not withdrawing the the immunity from the gun manufacturer who has nothing to do with these particular awful cases.

2193
05:46:18.000 --> 05:46:20.000
All right.

2194
05:46:20.000 --> 05:46:22.000
Anyone else?

2195
05:46:22.000 --> 05:46:24.000
Representative Page.

2196
05:46:24.000 --> 05:47:04.000
I guess one thought i would have a comment on this is that it seems like i mean i've heard different um factual assertions made different um thoughts about where liability should be or shouldn't be different suggestions suggestions about mental health and so on, but it does seem to me that at the same time at bottom, I would respectfully suggest, I think everybody shares the assumption, and again, I don't speak for everybody, that we have a problem.

2197
05:47:04.000 --> 05:47:19.000
But we don't know, it seems that the interim study forum would be the right forum to consider different facts, different assertions, different ideas about where that liability would be.

2198
05:47:19.000 --> 05:48:36.000
So I think even as we're having this discussion that seems to air some discrepancies about what we believe or what we think is true or whatever, it seems me to make the argument for an interim study strong all right representative turk yeah i just wanted to make one one more statement um in response to representative perez's statement um i believe she was referring to the recent chester arms um supreme court decision is that is that right okay um okay i'm not sure if she was um but anyway points the same um that case came out a few weeks ago um it basically in terms of whether whether or not the this this law doesn't just give immunity manufacturers it gives immunity to to um sellers of of weapons the court case was again, I'm interpreting as a non-lawyer, centered around whether or not that sale was legal or not.

2199
05:48:36.000 --> 05:48:46.000
And the person in question, without dispute, had a long history of legal problems, a long history of mental problems.

2200
05:48:46.000 --> 05:49:47.000
the court reviewed the statute as it stands right now and you use the plain language reading of the law for the most part clarify that because of the way the statute is written and and by the way i think you had said shot at something these were two police officers that were shot by this person so i want to make it very clear i don't think i hope nobody around the table thinks that was a good outcome that somebody who had a long history of mental health and um and and legal issues um should be allowed to shoot two police officers whether or not that sale was illegal is sort of more the question on the table.

2201
05:49:47.000 --> 05:50:07.500
And so I guess in defense, again, of interim study, if we don't agree that that was the right outcome, that to me would be the reason for us to put some extra work into this rather than saying everything's okay.

2202
05:50:07.500 --> 05:51:46.500
Because that Supreme Court case came down and said that sale, based the current way that that things are structured was not illegal um and therefore um not only it had nothing to do with whether the case had merit it had to do with whether the case could even have in my understanding uh standing that the plaintiff could even even ask for it and and the answer was no so again i think that would be use of good use of our time all right um mr jenner if i might just to add to that in essence what the supreme court did reaffirm is that that actor who shot the two police officers was not a prohibited person uh in the opinion of the state or the federal government what is also not talked about uh in this particular case is what's called the fireman's rule goes back about 100 years and the intent of the statute and it does apply here in new hampshire firemen police officers first responders they have it in their employment contracts that there's a chance you could get shot at or injured or killed in the line of duty.

2203
05:51:46.500 --> 05:51:51.500
And as such, you cannot sue civilly because of that.

2204
05:51:51.500 --> 05:51:58.500
That would really apply in this particular case we're talking about, the fireman's rule.

2205
05:51:58.500 --> 05:52:04.500
So legally and technically, they really didn't have grounds to sue civilly.

2206
05:52:04.500 --> 05:52:07.500
That's why there's no civil case.

2207
05:52:07.500 --> 05:52:09.500
All right, Representative Ford.

2208
05:52:09.500 --> 05:52:11.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

2209
05:52:11.500 --> 05:52:13.500
Representative Ford.

2210
05:52:13.500 --> 05:52:17.000
Well, I was actually born in Chicago.

2211
05:52:17.000 --> 05:52:19.500
You were talking about Chicago.

2212
05:52:19.500 --> 05:52:26.000
There's a lot that goes into the rate of gun violence in Chicago.

2213
05:52:26.000 --> 05:52:29.000
It's not just Illinois' gun laws.

2214
05:52:29.000 --> 05:52:41.500
In fact, actually, it's probably somewhat overstated how dangerous Chicago is, and I spent part of my childhood there because I was originally in Illinois.

2215
05:52:41.500 --> 05:52:55.000
Illinois and Indiana are separated by basically an imaginary line that's drawn on the ground, which actually goes right through the middle of the Chicago metropolitan area.

2216
05:52:55.000 --> 05:53:15.500
And that's true to actually the Illinois of the Massachusetts, New Hampshire state line, too, which we're a little bit farther from our state lines, a little bit farther from downtown Boston than the Indiana state line is from the loop.

2217
05:53:15.500 --> 05:53:22.000
But it's still not a long distance and people can easily transport guns.

2218
05:53:22.000 --> 05:54:32.000
And certainly at least people in Massachusetts have the perception that a lot of the gun violence is guns are being bought in New Hampshire, where the gun laws are somewhat more permissive than in uh than in Massachusetts and that's certainly like where a lot of the guns in uh Chicago come from people buy them in Indiana and drive from a few miles across the state line so I think um so I don't I don't think we should necessarily uh blame Illinois's gun laws for what's it's not the only cause of what's going on Chicago so that's that's, and so I don't, sorry, I mean, I just wanted to defend my, at least defend the city where I was metropolitan area lived in when I was nine, mostly on the Indiana side of the imaginary line.

2219
05:54:32.000 --> 05:54:44.500
But that's, so I don't think, so I don't think strong gun laws cause gun violence, nor do looser ones won't necessarily prevent it either.

2220
05:54:44.500 --> 05:54:53.500
So in fact, if anything, gun laws are a reaction to the level of violence in the place.

2221
05:54:53.500 --> 05:55:35.500
Places like New Hampshire and Vermont are more permissive, mostly because people aren't as afraid of gun violence because it's a more peaceful place than some other parts of the country so you know anyways all right um so i i guess i think we're probably ready for a vote on this i guess i i want to say maybe it's sort of a for my comment i intend to vote against the uh interim study motion and i do it for this reason.

2222
05:55:35.500 --> 05:55:56.500
With great respect for the ranking member, this is an area where I think, at least for me, there is no feasible option that I could imagine involving holding manufacturers or dealers liable for what happens when somebody criminally misuses a gun.

2223
05:55:56.500 --> 05:56:04.500
And bear in mind that this immunity has nothing to do with like a defective gun.

2224
05:56:04.500 --> 05:56:32.000
If the gun goes off when it's dropped because the trigger mechanism isn't right right that the manufacturer can clearly be sued this is this is designed to uh if this immunity were gone the kind of lawsuits that we would see against manufacturers are along the lines of well you, you manufactured an AR-15.

2225
05:56:32.000 --> 05:56:47.500
Even though it's perfectly lawful, let's see if we can get a jury to say that that's unreasonably, it's defective and unreasonably dangerous because you shouldn't have sold it at all.

2226
05:56:47.500 --> 05:56:52.000
That's the kind of lawsuits that would be allowed.

2227
05:56:52.000 --> 05:57:08.500
And so this, it just seems to me that even if we were to interim study this, when it's time to write something, we would be, my suspicion is we're going to vote.

2228
05:57:08.500 --> 05:57:15.500
We're going to be, we're going to have a 10-10 vote on interim study.

2229
05:57:15.500 --> 05:57:32.500
And if we did, if it turned out to be an 11-9 vote in favor of interim study, when it's time to write something on interim study at the end, we would be 2-10-10.

2230
05:57:32.500 --> 05:57:43.500
Ten people would say, we should further take some action, and ten people would say, no, this is a really bad idea.

2231
05:57:43.500 --> 05:57:49.000
So I don't think that that advances the ball at all.

2232
05:57:49.000 --> 05:57:55.500
My suspicion is we're going to have a 10-10 vote on interim study.

2233
05:57:55.500 --> 05:58:07.500
Then somebody's going to make a motion of ought to pass the original bill, and we're going to have a 10-10 vote on that.

2234
05:58:07.500 --> 05:58:18.500
And then when this company's going to make a motion for ITL, and we're going to have a 10-10 vote on that.

2235
05:58:18.500 --> 05:59:02.000
And my only – I may be predicting wrong, but my only sort of – you know, from my perspective, my only sort of – the only – what I think may be something of a bright spot in this is I think when all these things get to the floor, I believe the people who feel as I do will have the majority because there will be some people in the other party who will agree with what I think most, if not all, Republicans believe.

2236
05:59:02.000 --> 05:59:04.000
Mr.

2237
05:59:04.000 --> 05:59:11.000
Chair, I would like to object to you describing this along strict party lines.

2238
05:59:11.000 --> 05:59:14.500
It is not a party line issue.

2239
05:59:14.500 --> 05:59:56.500
There might be more people on one side than the other, but this is not something where you will see an absolutely uniform vote the way we do for example about those people who believe in public education oh no no I thought in fact I thought exactly exactly what I said was that it when it gets to the floor it will not be a strict party line vote I suspect that there will be quite a so I I agree with you.

2240
05:59:56.500 --> 06:00:01.500
I don't think it is a strict party line vote.

2241
06:00:01.500 --> 06:00:04.500
Sorry, I misunderstood what you said.

2242
06:00:04.500 --> 06:00:06.500
Oh, all right.

2243
06:00:06.500 --> 06:00:08.500
All right.

2244
06:00:08.500 --> 06:00:10.500
Yes, Representative Stapleton.

2245
06:00:10.500 --> 06:00:26.000
Hypothetically, if this were to go to interim study, an amendment has made, could an amendment actually remove the, or supplant the immunity removal provision with responsible, irresponsible, reckless gun usage?

2246
06:00:26.000 --> 06:00:30.000
Or is that, would that not be germane?

2247
06:00:30.000 --> 06:00:38.500
Or was there a problem with radically changing the bill and the interim study in that manner?

2248
06:00:38.500 --> 06:00:44.500
I'd be happy to answer that if it's all right with you.

2249
06:00:44.500 --> 06:00:47.000
The interim study can come.

2250
06:00:47.000 --> 06:00:58.000
Don't forget, we won't be voting on the results of the interim study because this is the second year of the term.

2251
06:00:58.000 --> 06:01:04.500
What we would be doing is recommending for future legislation or not recommending.

2252
06:01:04.500 --> 06:01:10.000
And the report that we write can have anything in it.

2253
06:01:10.000 --> 06:01:15.500
We can say, this is the bill that came to us.

2254
06:01:15.500 --> 06:01:21.000
We do not think that this bill was an appropriate vehicle.

2255
06:01:21.000 --> 06:01:29.500
Instead, what we believe dealing with the issue of guns, we think X or Y or Z.

2256
06:01:29.500 --> 06:01:39.500
So we have, it depends upon the seriousness of the people who agree to be on the Interim Study Committee.

2257
06:01:39.500 --> 06:01:43.500
We can come up with anything we please.

2258
06:01:43.500 --> 06:02:02.500
And over the years, we can all give examples of where there were dramatic changes through the interim study process, and then someone would file a new bill that came closer to what the Interim Study Committee recommended.

2259
06:02:02.500 --> 06:02:13.000
Otherwise, it would be just, this isn't a case, Representative Stapleton, of trying to give a gentle end to a bill.

2260
06:02:13.000 --> 06:02:31.500
It is a case where I, and I was serious in what I said, where I think we might be able to find something that needs to be done and set out a way to do it.

2261
06:02:31.500 --> 06:02:38.500
Yeah, that was my question, if that flexibility was possible within the interim study.

2262
06:02:38.500 --> 06:02:45.500
But it comes back to the committee for a vote on the recommendation, right?

2263
06:02:45.500 --> 06:02:58.000
Well, the full committee, there would be a subcommittee and the subcommittee might consist of the entire committee if everybody wanted to participate, not likely.

2264
06:02:58.000 --> 06:03:22.500
But then what would happen is the chair of the full committee would hold a committee meeting near the end of October for this and any other bills that were under interim study for the full committee to agree or not agree on the recommendations of the sub committees.

2265
06:03:22.500 --> 06:03:27.500
And that would then be the report that gets filed.

2266
06:03:27.500 --> 06:03:29.500
Thank you.

2267
06:03:29.500 --> 06:03:31.500
All right.

2268
06:03:31.500 --> 06:03:34.500
Any, any other, any other comments?

2269
06:03:34.500 --> 06:03:36.500
All right.

2270
06:03:36.500 --> 06:03:41.000
So I think we're probably ready for a vote.

2271
06:03:41.000 --> 06:03:44.000
On the motion is interim study.

2272
06:03:44.000 --> 06:03:46.000
Moved by Representative Smith.

2273
06:03:46.000 --> 06:03:48.000

Yes.

2292

Rep Horrigan.

2293
06:04:26.500 --> 06:04:37.000
It may come as a surprise given my previous remarks, but I'm going to vote yes on the interim study motion.

2294
06:04:37.000 --> 06:04:39.000
Rep.

2308
06:05:05.000 --> 06:05:07.000
Yes.

2309
06:05:07.000 --> 06:05:09.000
Rep.

2310
06:05:09.000 --> 06:05:11.000
Manos?

2311
06:05:11.000 --> 06:05:13.000

2312
06:05:13.000 --> 06:05:15.000
Rep.

2313
06:05:15.000 --> 06:05:17.000
Tura?

2314
06:05:17.000 --> 06:05:19.000
Yes.

2315
06:05:19.000 --> 06:05:21.000
Rep.

2316
06:05:21.000 --> 06:05:23.000
Howard?

2317
06:05:23.000 --> 06:05:25.000
Yes.

2318
06:05:25.000 --> 06:05:27.000
Chairman Lin?

2319
06:05:27.000 --> 06:05:29.000
No.

2320
06:05:29.000 --> 06:05:31.500
Motion fails 10 to 10.

2321
06:05:31.500 --> 06:05:33.500
Mr.

2322
06:05:33.500 --> 06:05:35.500
Chair.

2323
06:05:35.500 --> 06:05:37.500
Yes.

2324
06:05:37.500 --> 06:05:42.000
Is there an opportunity for me to move ITL?

2325
06:05:42.000 --> 06:05:44.000
Yes.

2326
06:05:44.000 --> 06:05:48.000
I will recognize Representative Alexander for a motion.

2327
06:05:48.000 --> 06:05:50.000
Thank you.

2328
06:05:50.000 --> 06:05:54.000
I'd like to move an expedient to legislate.

2329
06:05:54.000 --> 06:05:56.000
I second.

2330
06:05:56.000 --> 06:05:58.000
Seconded by Representative Kutab.

2331
06:05:58.000 --> 06:06:00.000
Any further discussion?

2332
06:06:00.000 --> 06:06:02.000
Representative Terp.

2333
06:06:02.000 --> 06:06:04.000
Yeah.

2334
06:06:04.000 --> 06:06:06.000
Thanks.

2335
06:06:06.000 --> 06:06:38.000
So i did say i might make a little bit more uh clear um about the vote whether i assumed it would potentially get to itl or otp so i'm gonna vote against itl um but i wanted to make it clear what I think the exercise of going through the amendment process and the discussion around the interim study question helped me clarify.

2336
06:06:38.000 --> 06:06:56.000
the amendment that I tried to offer, which I accept we did not support, that basically said for this one blanket immunity that exists in our law, I think the issue with the vaccines is different.

2337
06:06:56.000 --> 06:07:02.500
Blanket immunity, which says you can't even bring a case because of this.

2338
06:07:02.500 --> 06:07:32.500
The attempt was to say, only if you are found by a jury based on the same evidence needed to bring a civil case, that you committed a felony in the sale or manufacture of the weapon in question that got used, then not that doesn't mean you would win that case, it means you could at least be heard.

2339
06:07:32.500 --> 06:08:19.000
So it was a very small attempt to, to clarify what I think is one of the more glaring issues with the statute the way it stands, because right now it says, even if a jury would have found that you committed, and's the word that I tried to insert, was committed instead of convicted of, because convicted of requires a separate trial that can either not be brought or that can fail for reasons that have actually not a lot to do with the underlying question of whether those acts were committed.

2340
06:08:19.000 --> 06:08:21.000
that was the attempt.

2341
06:08:21.000 --> 06:08:34.000
So it was an attempt to say, could we find something to move us slightly forward on this so that we're inching in the right direction?

2342
06:08:34.000 --> 06:08:36.000
But it wasn't possible.

2343
06:08:36.000 --> 06:09:00.000
So right now, the law basically says even if a jury would have found that you committed a felony in the sale or manufacture of that weapon that was used in that way, the person who was injured does not have any ability to be heard in court.

2344
06:09:00.000 --> 06:09:09.000
And so to me, that's a big problem, considering it's the only industry that has that blanket protection.

2345
06:09:09.000 --> 06:09:27.500
And so that plus the fact that we are so sure that we can't move forward on this, that it wasn't worth the time that I think some of us were willing to spend thinking about it.

2346
06:09:27.500 --> 06:09:34.000
That is leading me to vote against the ITL, even though I tried.

2347
06:09:34.000 --> 06:09:37.000
It wasn't an exercise in futility.

2348
06:09:37.000 --> 06:09:43.000
It was an exercise to sort of test what the limits were.

2349
06:09:43.000 --> 06:09:48.500
But that's going to be my reason to vote against ITL.

2350
06:09:48.500 --> 06:09:50.500
Thanks.

2351
06:09:50.500 --> 06:09:52.500
All right.

2352
06:09:52.500 --> 06:09:54.500
Any other comments?

2353
06:09:54.500 --> 06:09:56.500
Are we ready?

2354
06:09:56.500 --> 06:09:58.500
Yes, Representative Devine.

2355
06:09:58.500 --> 06:10:07.000
My reason to vote against the ITL is all about the manufacturer's intention of producing a weapon.

2356
06:10:07.000 --> 06:10:12.000
Their intention is either to target practice or kill someone.

2357
06:10:12.000 --> 06:10:29.500
So that's already established unless they can change what they're thinking or what they're doing when they're producing a product that is primarily used for either killing or targeting, killing either humans or an animal.

2358
06:10:29.500 --> 06:10:31.500
It's a weapon.

2359
06:10:31.500 --> 06:10:47.500
And the intention for the distributor is to kill it's already there that's their intention for the product is it not so i would move i'm voting itl on this Representative Greeson.

2360
06:10:47.500 --> 06:10:54.000
In personal defense, the use of a firearm is to stop the threat.

2361
06:10:54.000 --> 06:10:59.000
Sometimes you need to use deadly force, but when you...

2362
06:10:59.000 --> 06:11:02.500
the objective is to stop the threat.

2363
06:11:02.500 --> 06:11:33.000
Police officers are trained, you shoot to kill, because if they shoot to injure that opens them up to liability you can't just blow out his kneecap you have to shoot for center of mass all right any other comments all right i think we're ready for the vote then the motion uh before us is representative alexander's motion of it.

2364
06:11:33.000 --> 06:11:38.500
And I think I'd ask the clerk to call the roll.

2365
06:11:38.500 --> 06:11:40.500
Vice Chairman Wallace.

2366
06:11:40.500 --> 06:11:42.500

No.

2419
06:14:42.000 --> 06:14:44.500
Motion fails 7 to 13.

2420
06:14:44.500 --> 06:14:52.000
So, you know what, Representative Smith, I'm going to ask you to help me out.

2421
06:14:52.000 --> 06:15:08.000
So, the OTP has failed, but ITL has also failed so it does it go to how does it go to the floor now even right okay right that's what I thought.

2422
06:15:08.000 --> 06:15:13.000
And someone would be responsible for ITL on the floor.

2423
06:15:13.000 --> 06:15:21.000
And someone would be responsible for interim study on the floor, OTP doesn't make the grade.

2424
06:15:21.000 --> 06:15:24.000
Doesn't make the grade, right, okay.

2425
06:15:24.000 --> 06:15:26.000
That's what I thought.

2426
06:15:26.000 --> 06:15:33.500
I mean, there'd be no reason for us to go back again because we've established.

2427
06:15:33.500 --> 06:15:35.500
Right.

2428
06:15:35.500 --> 06:15:53.500
So, okay, so it's going to be without recommendation on Bo and so for the report the report would say basically would would basically spell that out that it was an idea that it was a.

2429
06:15:53.500 --> 06:16:14.500
one person would write a report for um ITL and one would write one would write a report okay for interim study and my guess, I don't know, this would be the clerk's call, ordinarily the ought to pass motion goes first.

2430
06:16:14.500 --> 06:16:16.500
Right.

2431
06:16:16.500 --> 06:16:35.000
And in this case, there is no ought to pass motion, so the clerk will decide and the speaker will decide whether interim study is the first motion the full house will consider or whether it's ITL.

2432
06:16:35.000 --> 06:16:43.000
And I have an idea of what it would be, but I wouldn't know for sure.

2433
06:16:43.000 --> 06:16:48.000
That would be up to the clerk and the speaker.

2434
06:16:48.000 --> 06:17:09.000
week all right so do i have a volunteer to write the itl report representative alexander all right and how about the interim study report all right and i don't do anything syndrome studies all right so you're off to All right.

2435
06:17:09.000 --> 06:17:13.000
So you're off to look at Representative Manos.

2436
06:17:13.000 --> 06:17:15.000
All right.

2437
06:17:15.000 --> 06:17:17.000
All right.

2438
06:17:17.000 --> 06:17:22.000
Next, I'd like to move on to House Bill 1020.

2439
06:17:22.000 --> 06:17:28.500
That's establishing a commission to study implications of insanity and restoration of competency.

2440
06:17:28.500 --> 06:17:30.500
I recognize Representative Kutab.

2441
06:17:30.500 --> 06:17:33.500
I believe she has an amendment.

2442
06:17:33.500 --> 06:17:44.000
I would move I would move OTP with the adoption of amendment 2024-0703H, which I passed out to everybody last week.

2443
06:17:44.000 --> 06:17:46.000
Excuse me.

2444
06:17:46.000 --> 06:17:48.000
10-20.

2445
06:17:48.000 --> 06:17:50.000
1020.

2446
06:17:50.000 --> 06:17:52.000
1020.

2447
06:17:52.000 --> 06:17:57.000
It's the establishing a committee to study restoration of competency.

2448
06:17:57.000 --> 06:17:59.000
you you 0703.

2449
06:17:59.000 --> 06:18:01.000

Thank you.

2451
06:18:03.000 --> 06:18:05.000
All right.

2452
06:18:05.000 --> 06:18:07.000
All right.

2453
06:18:07.000 --> 06:18:12.000
Do you wish to speak to the amendment, Representative Patab?

2454
06:18:12.000 --> 06:18:22.000
So the amendment is changing the members of the committee as per suggestions that had come out at the hearing.

2455
06:18:22.000 --> 06:18:24.000
Rep.

2456
06:18:24.000 --> 06:18:30.500
Pearson went and put this together for the suggestions that had come out.

2457
06:18:30.500 --> 06:18:32.500
Right.

2458
06:18:32.500 --> 06:18:34.500
All right.

2459
06:18:34.500 --> 06:18:37.500
Any further discussion on the amendment?

2460
06:18:37.500 --> 06:18:39.500
All right.

2461
06:18:39.500 --> 06:18:45.500
So I think we can do a show of hands on that.

2462
06:18:45.500 --> 06:19:15.500

Is there a second?

2465

Howard.

2529
06:21:31.000 --> 06:21:33.000
Yes.

2530
06:21:33.000 --> 06:21:35.000
Chairman Lynn.

2531
06:21:35.000 --> 06:21:37.000
Yes.

2532
06:21:37.000 --> 06:21:39.500
Motion passes 20 to 0.

2533
06:21:39.500 --> 06:21:41.500
Okay.

2534
06:21:41.500 --> 06:21:43.500
All right.

2535
06:21:43.500 --> 06:21:49.000
And Representative Katab, could I ask you to write the report?

2536
06:21:49.000 --> 06:21:51.000
Copy to.

2537
06:21:51.000 --> 06:21:53.000
All right.

2538
06:21:53.000 --> 06:21:55.000
Oh, yeah.

2539
06:21:55.000 --> 06:22:49.500
This can be on consent huh consent anyone yeah okay next is with regard to House Bill 1082 I spoke to Representative Turin and also Representative Manos, and there's sort of a tricky little issue here about, I think we all want to get to where Representative Turrer wants to get to with his amendment, that is to allow an assistant manager to be able to wind up a company, but there's this issue about, particularly in the legal context, is there some things that an assistant, would the assistant manager just by virtue of that somehow be violating the requirements of that only a lawyer can practice law?

2540
06:22:49.500 --> 06:22:57.500
I mean, arguably a position, but I think it might become more questionable with a lawyer.

2541
06:22:57.500 --> 06:23:15.500
At any rate, what has been suggested, and I think is an excellent idea, is rather than vote on this today, I'd like to appoint a subcommittee of Representative Ter, Representative Manos, myself, and Representative Ming.

2542
06:23:15.500 --> 06:23:17.500
That's right.

2543
06:23:17.500 --> 06:23:22.000
And maybe we should make Representative Ming the chair.

2544
06:23:22.000 --> 06:23:24.000
No, I'm kidding.

2545
06:23:24.000 --> 06:23:34.500
I was thinking when you're not here, when you're not here, we volunteer you to be the chairman of the subcommittee.

2546
06:23:34.500 --> 06:23:37.000
But I won't do that.

2547
06:23:37.000 --> 06:23:45.000
I'll make Representative Turner the chairman of the subcommittee so that we can work on this.

2548
06:23:45.000 --> 06:23:55.500
And hopefully, I mean, we should be able to find a solution to this problem because I understand the problem completely.

2549
06:23:55.500 --> 06:23:58.500
It makes a lot of sense.

2550
06:23:58.500 --> 06:24:02.500
And hopefully we'll be able to do that.

2551
06:24:02.500 --> 06:24:33.000
The only thing I would suggest to Representative Turner, just I think there, I mean, we have, we're not, we're not to do this by tomorrow, but we only, we only do have probably three weeks or so before we got to get, you know, this has got to, so if we can move relatively quickly on this, I'd appreciate it.

2552
06:24:33.000 --> 06:24:35.000
Understood.

2553
06:24:35.000 --> 06:24:37.000
Okay, great.

2554
06:24:37.000 --> 06:25:21.500
All right, uh 10 89 um this is the uh the one to uh eliminate the statute of limitations with regard to uh pfas um so uh do i have a motion all right my second all right um so it's been moved and seconded representative smith would you like to speak to your emotion yes I hesitated at first when I looked at this bill about removing the concept of statute of limitation because things shouldn't go on forever except in this case the chemicals go on forever.

2555
06:25:21.500 --> 06:25:47.500
And the problem is that they are every place, they go on forever and Saint Albain, one of the major players in this chose to pick up and run, chose to leave the state and which actually I don't think is the most honest and open way to ask in this situation.

2556
06:25:47.500 --> 06:27:00.500
And therefore, I think it is only appropriate that we agree with this this proposal even though it does tread on new territory because the nature of the of the problem is so widespread and so forever Representative perez i think the comment that representative smith made at the hearing about the lawyer being brought all the way in from washington said a lot any other uh yes representative greeson in the notes that i scribbled for myself i have that i'm not opposed to suing the company but when you eliminate the statute of limitations it becomes very dangerous and pfas would be the only case with no statute of limitations i agree that we can modify the three years two years, three years, whatever it happens to be, but at some point in time, there does need to be a cap, an end point.

2557
06:27:00.500 --> 06:27:09.500
And, you know, even is there a possibility of capping the amount of damages that could be awarded?

2558
06:27:09.500 --> 06:27:22.000
At some point in time, you're going to have a very difficult time showing the causal relationship that that is actually what caused the injury.

2559
06:27:22.000 --> 06:27:33.000
If we all have these things in us, then how do we know that that's what caused whatever problem after 45 years?

2560
06:27:33.000 --> 06:27:45.000
So I think we run into the issues of by eliminating the statute of limitations, you just open this up beyond where reasonable limitations.

2561
06:27:45.000 --> 06:27:50.500
I think that we need to end it at some point.

2562
06:27:50.500 --> 06:27:52.500
Representative Alexander.

2563
06:27:52.500 --> 06:27:56.000
I happen to agree with Representative Griesen.

2564
06:27:56.000 --> 06:28:06.000
I think this is a really bad bill to open up the floodgates with this to unlimited amount of time.

2565
06:28:06.000 --> 06:28:14.000
It will completely damage business in the state, so I think we should vote against it.

2566
06:28:14.000 --> 06:28:16.000
All right.

2567
06:28:16.000 --> 06:28:18.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2568
06:28:18.000 --> 06:28:20.000
Thank you, Mr.

2569
06:28:20.000 --> 06:28:22.000
Chair, for recognizing me.

2570
06:28:22.000 --> 06:28:28.500
I know that I haven't, I'm not a permanent member of this committee.

2571
06:28:28.500 --> 06:28:30.500
I'm only a substitute.

2572
06:28:30.500 --> 06:29:30.500
But when we're looking at PFAS in particular, it is known as a forever chemical, because once it is ingested and is inside of our bodies it's never going to leave and the effects of these chemicals are something that can take years to develop and actually be cancer causing so to say that there should be a statute of limitations that is limited to only a handful of years as it is currently, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense if you are going to be experiencing, you know, dealing with cancer or another sort of illness, potentially 20 years down the line when we're currently only allowed to have six years of current statute of limitations.

2573
06:29:30.500 --> 06:29:41.500
So I think that in terms of this, I will be supporting the bill, and I urge everybody else to as well.

2574
06:29:41.500 --> 06:29:43.500
Thank you.

2575
06:29:43.500 --> 06:29:45.500
Any other comments?

2576
06:29:45.500 --> 06:29:47.500
Mr.

2577
06:29:47.500 --> 06:29:49.500
Chair?

2578
06:29:49.500 --> 06:29:53.000
Yes, Representative DiLorenzo and then Representative Cusat.

2579
06:29:53.000 --> 06:30:15.500
I think removing the statute of limitations on PFAS is a very good idea, mainly because children born, well, if a woman gets sick from PFAS and she's pregnant, you may not know that the child has contacted cancer or another disease for many years.

2580
06:30:15.500 --> 06:30:39.000
So it's, and there's a precedent there because back in the 80s, 90s in Woburn, Mass., if you all remember that movie, A Civil Action with John Travolta, it was about a company that had dangerous chemicals and it went into the drinking water in that town.

2581
06:30:39.000 --> 06:30:41.000
It's a big story.

2582
06:30:41.000 --> 06:30:47.000
I forget the name of the company, but it's a real thing.

2583
06:30:47.000 --> 06:30:49.000
Thank you.

2584
06:30:49.000 --> 06:30:51.000
All right.

2585
06:30:51.000 --> 06:30:53.000
Representative Katab.

2586
06:30:53.000 --> 06:30:57.500
Thank you, and thank you for letting me speak.

2587
06:30:57.500 --> 06:31:29.500
I just wanted to say that the current statue is six years after the date that the plaintiff should have discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or after they discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered that such harm, injury, or damages and the casual relationship of an act or omission to such harm or injury of damages.

2588
06:31:29.500 --> 06:31:36.500
So this isn't six years from the date that you may have consumed PFAS.

2589
06:31:36.500 --> 06:31:45.000
This is already currently six years from the date that you realized that you had an injury.

2590
06:31:45.000 --> 06:31:55.500
So the date perhaps that you were diagnosed with cancer and it might not even be six years from that day.

2591
06:31:55.500 --> 06:32:07.000
It might not be six years until the doctor actually tells you that the reason you probably got this was because of PFAS.

2592
06:32:07.000 --> 06:32:11.000
It would be six years from that date.

2593
06:32:11.000 --> 06:32:25.000
So I think that there is already a pretty large window after you've already discovered that this is why you got what you got for that to happen.

2594
06:32:25.000 --> 06:33:22.000
So I just, I want to say that while I hear a lot of people saying, well, you may not discover it for a while, but the way it stands now is if you don't discover it for a while you still have six years from that date until you do actually discover it so i just wanted to point that out because i i'm not i'm wondering if representative alexander thank you and i do want to point out that there's no the standard in here there's no standard of negligence so if the business or or somebody has found out to even do it on accident like they're still open Thank you.

2595
06:33:22.000 --> 06:33:29.000
And I do want to point out that there's no the standard in here.

2596
06:33:29.000 --> 06:33:31.500
There's no standard of negligence.

2597
06:33:31.500 --> 06:33:44.000
So if the business or or somebody has found out to even do it on accident, like they're still open to this sort of lawsuit.

2598
06:33:44.000 --> 06:33:55.000
So I just caution someone if to vote for this, if if there's not even a standard of negligence involved in it.

2599
06:33:55.000 --> 06:33:57.000
Representative Page.

2600
06:33:57.000 --> 06:33:59.000
Yeah, thanks.

2601
06:33:59.000 --> 06:34:02.000
I thank you for recognizing me.

2602
06:34:02.000 --> 06:34:10.500
My understanding of PFAS is that the science continues to develop an understanding of what it is.

2603
06:34:10.500 --> 06:34:22.000
And while I can certainly, as someone, I can certainly understand the hesitation with respect to sort of this unlimited statute of limitations.

2604
06:34:22.000 --> 06:34:27.500
I think with this particular case, I'm more comfortable with it.

2605
06:34:27.500 --> 06:35:07.000
in terms of the causation, my sense of it is that the market will sort itself out in terms of which lawyer is going to look at this and say you've got a strong case on the causation element and be able to determine that it does seem to me that if it's any indication that some companies who have left new hampshire have a little more knowledge than than a lot of us about the effects of PFAS.

2606
06:35:07.000 --> 06:35:17.500
And maybe this will help folks catch up with the science as the science catches up with what diseases this causes.

2607
06:35:17.500 --> 06:35:27.500
So I recognize the hesitation about expanding the statute of limitations, but in this particular instance, I think it's warranted.

2608
06:35:27.500 --> 06:35:29.500
All right.

2609
06:35:29.500 --> 06:35:31.500
Any other comments?

2610
06:35:31.500 --> 06:35:33.500
Representative Terrell.

2611
06:35:33.500 --> 06:36:24.500
Yeah, just one other thought that came out of the hearing for me was the ubiquity of PFAS in the world, the thousands of chemicals that fall under the general heading, and then the fact that all of us have them in our systems in varying quantities and varying types, to me, is a reason why this group should be sort of treated separately, because even after you've been, say, told you have cancer, it may be a long time before you can work through the process of figuring out whether or not you can attach that injury to any given exposure.

2612
06:36:24.500 --> 06:36:45.000
And so it feels like an echoing with what Representative Page said, you know, a lot of that is still evolving and it feels as though, you know, this would be a place where leaving the window open would be better.

2613
06:36:45.000 --> 06:36:58.500
Although I generally do agree with the principle of, you know, from the time you discover your injury for the overall concept of that type of liability.

2614
06:36:58.500 --> 06:37:00.500
All right.

2615
06:37:00.500 --> 06:37:14.500
So I guess what I, the only thing I would say on this is, I think, I think it, I don't, I don't think that this is necessary.

2616
06:37:14.500 --> 06:37:21.500
and I think that it would create a really sort of bad public policy.

2617
06:37:21.500 --> 06:37:25.500
And the reason I say that is this.

2618
06:37:25.500 --> 06:37:36.500
Remember, it's the language that Representative Kutab read from the statute, and this is the law for the statute of limitations anyway.

2619
06:37:36.500 --> 06:37:45.500
What's called the discovery rule, which is in current law, says that your cause of action doesn't accrue.

2620
06:37:45.500 --> 06:38:00.500
You have to not only know that you have been harmed, but you have to know the causal relationship between the harm and the person that you're seeking to sue.

2621
06:38:00.500 --> 06:38:02.500
at the end.

2622
06:38:02.500 --> 06:38:14.000
you have been harmed, but you have to know the causal relationship between the harm and the person that you're seeking to sue.

2623
06:38:14.000 --> 06:38:34.500
And so, you know, for example, and that means that, you know, things can happen, like look at all the asbestos cases, all of those asbestos cases, many of those cases go back, you know, decades, 20, 30 years or something.

2624
06:38:34.500 --> 06:39:05.500
People are still allowed to bring or were still allowed to bring their claims because they might say, well, I knew that I had some problem and it had to do with asbestos, but I didn't realize that it was this employer or whatever that was that had made use of asbestos somehow in their facility or somehow in their manufacturing process.

2625
06:39:05.500 --> 06:39:19.000
So what it seems to me that if we passed this law, what we would be saying is you can be somebody who was harmed by PFAS.

2626
06:39:19.000 --> 06:39:24.000
And now you know that you were harmed by PFAS.

2627
06:39:24.000 --> 06:39:33.000
And you know that you were harmed by PFAS, and you know that, let's say it was St.

2628
06:39:33.000 --> 06:39:49.500
Gobin that was responsible for injecting, for exposing you to the PFAS that caused your injury, and you can still sit on your hands for the period of the regular statute of limitations.

2629
06:39:49.500 --> 06:39:52.000
Why does that make sense?

2630
06:39:52.000 --> 06:40:09.500
Why should you be able to say, it's okay for me to have that information that I just described and still wait for six years or three years, whatever the regular statute of limitations is?

2631
06:40:09.500 --> 06:40:12.000
Why does that make sense?

2632
06:40:12.000 --> 06:40:19.000
Yet that would be the only practical purpose of eliminating the statute of limitations.

2633
06:40:19.000 --> 06:40:37.500
It would be basically to say, yeah, you can you know, you can grow or you can grow old, so to speak, with all that knowledge that that you were harmed and that that the the St.

2634
06:40:37.500 --> 06:40:46.500
open whatever was responsible and never bring a suit until, you know, 30 years after you knew that.

2635
06:40:46.500 --> 06:40:55.500
Why does that, why would we allow people to sit on their rights for that, in that circumstance?

2636
06:40:55.500 --> 06:41:03.000
And what kind of message does that send to, you know, to the world generally?

2637
06:41:03.000 --> 06:41:08.500
I mean, you know, man, it seems to me that that.

2638
06:41:08.500 --> 06:41:25.500
Some, you know, some people will say, well, wait a minute, this is some companies, some businesses might say, well, wait a minute, they, you know, PFAS is the is the bad guy today.

2639
06:41:25.500 --> 06:41:35.000
you know will I become the bad guy today, you know, will I become the bad guy next year?

2640
06:41:35.000 --> 06:41:42.500
And so maybe New Hampshire is not the place for me to have my business.

2641
06:41:42.500 --> 06:42:01.000
I don't, I mean, I don't recall, maybe somebody, maybe there was some testimony on this and I just, but is there any other state that has simply eliminated the statute of limitations for really for any?

2642
06:42:01.000 --> 06:42:11.000
I mean, other than murder, obviously, in criminal law, murder has always not been subject to a statute of limitations.

2643
06:42:11.000 --> 06:42:20.500
But aside from that in the criminal law, I don't think that we've eliminated the statute of limitations elsewhere.

2644
06:42:20.500 --> 06:42:23.500
Maybe I just missed the testimony.

2645
06:42:23.500 --> 06:42:32.000
So Chris Appel from the American Tort Reform Association stated that no state has ever done this.

2646
06:42:32.000 --> 06:42:57.500
So I think, I mean, I think it's really important that you understand that this is not, that would be the only thing we would be accomplishing by eliminating the statute of limitations is to say that even when you know, to be fair, it's not just know, it should know.

2647
06:42:57.500 --> 06:43:22.000
Even if you knew or should have known that you were harmed by PFAS and you knew or should have known that the causal relationship between that harm and the defendant, in effect, you can still just sit on your rights for the regular period of statute of limitations.

2648
06:43:22.000 --> 06:43:24.000
Yes, representative Howard.

2649
06:43:24.000 --> 06:43:26.000
Thank you.

2650
06:43:26.000 --> 06:43:41.000
I Have a number of concerns with people actually acting on their right to sue a contaminator In this instance because of the way that it's written for six years.

2651
06:43:41.000 --> 06:43:57.000
My significant other, she works in, has done research in PFAS contamination and even this summer was looking at a case where there was suspected firefighter foam that was contaminating an aquifer.

2652
06:43:57.000 --> 06:44:10.500
And the consulting firm that she was interning for wasn't able to make a final distinction, despite this being a several-year debate over what the contaminant was.

2653
06:44:10.500 --> 06:44:25.500
And it was fairly difficult for the firm to actually confirm whether it was the firefighting foam, which was kind of the main suspect, or whether it was something else.

2654
06:44:25.500 --> 06:45:00.000
And because of the time that that has taken for just a singular case, I just have worry that some people may interpret this as the fact that they may have been diagnosed with cancer or some other disease six years previous, but are unable to prove who was the actual contaminator in that instance, and thus would not necessarily bring forward a suit, letting the contaminator go free.

2655
06:45:00.000 --> 06:45:02.000
Thank you.

2656
06:45:02.000 --> 06:45:04.000
Yes, Representative Payton.

2657
06:45:04.000 --> 06:45:09.000
I'm sorry, and I have great respect for the chair.

2658
06:45:09.000 --> 06:45:12.500
I just want to make two points.

2659
06:45:12.500 --> 06:45:35.500
One, I wonder as a practical matter if, and I'm trying to put myself in this position, which fortunately I am not in, but if I had known or some knowledge of a PFAS causing cancer, which these things do, and there are thousands of them.

2660
06:45:35.500 --> 06:45:47.000
I'm not sure I'd sit on that right, because I'm not sure what that implication would be for me personally with my health.

2661
06:45:47.000 --> 06:46:07.000
The second point I would make is if the message that we send as a matter of public policy is if you're thinking about setting up business in New Hampshire, and you know what you produce harms people, stay away.

2662
06:46:07.000 --> 06:46:24.000
So I'm okay with that message thank you all right other comments yes representative Breeson this is an emotional bill to to great extent the the damage that has done by polluters, it's tragic.

2663
06:46:24.000 --> 06:46:26.000
It's perhaps criminal.

2664
06:46:26.000 --> 06:46:28.000
I don't know.

2665
06:46:28.000 --> 06:46:33.000
The damage is not questioned as far as I'm concerned.

2666
06:46:33.000 --> 06:47:08.000
I think that they have polluted and they've done damage, and now they want to hightail it out of here but being a person who ate lead-based paint chips that were on my crib although that was 50 years ago I've stopped since then I've used Roundup but I stopped using it about 40 years ago my family extended family chain smokers so I was around secondhand smoke for years.

2667
06:47:08.000 --> 06:47:14.500
I never smoked myself, but I was exposed to secondhand smoke for years.

2668
06:47:14.500 --> 06:47:17.000
I was in the Navy.

2669
06:47:17.000 --> 06:47:22.000
I was exposed to radiation as a nuke machinist mate.

2670
06:47:22.000 --> 06:47:36.000
I've literally been inside a reactor compartment, and not while it was actually critical because that would be deadly pretty quickly, but there is still residual radiation exposure.

2671
06:47:36.000 --> 06:47:44.000
I've got PFAS because I'm a human being that's alive today, so we all have it.

2672
06:47:44.000 --> 06:48:41.500
You know, there are just so many other environmental factors that I don't know how in the way, I don't know who to sue now, to be quite honest with you uh I'm going to die of something someday and maybe it'll be diagnosed as cancer somewhere in my body but I don't know how unless there is just definitive proof that that company dumped that crap into your drinking water and you drank it like the case down in down in Massachusetts or several other places where those of things have happened, I just don't know how in the world we can identify after so many years that that's what caused this particular illness.

2673
06:48:41.500 --> 06:49:37.000
And then to say the statute of limitations is infinite after that, I just don't if we if we want if we don't want polluters to come to new hampshire i agree you're not going to come set up shop i totally agree with representative page there but this bill does not do that and that's not the right way that's not that's not this is not the way to send that message other yes representative staples yeah i i agree with uh representative greeson on that because you know our our culture is just replete with chemicals and all forms and types uh it's uh the bane of modern living.

2674
06:49:37.000 --> 06:49:52.000
And if we take the immunity away on the PFAS, then the question will be who's next if I manufacture ammonium chloride or whatever bad stuff might be out there.

2675
06:49:52.000 --> 06:50:31.500
I'm going to go or I'm not going to go there um i think it's already been pointed out that blanket removal of the statute of limitations could have some far-reaching and harmful effects for the economy and even for citizens you know as a practical matter if you tell people you got six years from discovery well i better get on this if you tell people you've got six years from discovery, well, I better get on this.

2676
06:50:31.500 --> 06:50:41.000
If you have no limit, well, maybe I can get to it next year or I'm too busy now.

2677
06:50:41.000 --> 06:50:53.500
And you know, if you've got dangerous stuff in your body and it's detected, you want to take care of that sooner rather than later.

2678
06:50:53.500 --> 06:51:25.500
I mean, that's the basic principle of medical healing so i don't think it serves even the the culture well uh to kick it down the road to provide extra time um let it lag all right are we ready for a vote all right i'm going to ask the uh clerk to call the role the The motion is OTP by Representative Smith.

Yes.

2735
06:54:05.500 --> 06:54:08.000
Motion fails 10 to 10.

2736
06:54:08.000 --> 06:54:16.500
All right so it'll go to the floor without recommendation the OTP motion will be heard first.

2737
06:54:16.500 --> 06:54:18.500
Representative Smith can I?

2738
06:54:18.500 --> 06:54:20.500
Is there any point?

2739
06:54:20.500 --> 06:54:34.500
If a motion were made, if a motion were made for interim study, not having been made by Representative Alexander, of course, could, would anyone change their vote?

2740
06:54:34.500 --> 06:54:37.000
Could I ask that question?

2741
06:54:37.000 --> 06:54:39.000
Sure, No, absolutely.

2742
06:54:39.000 --> 06:54:41.000
That's a fair question.

2743
06:54:41.000 --> 06:54:49.500
And speaking for myself, I feel less strongly about this than I did about the gun thing.

2744
06:54:49.500 --> 06:54:51.500
Right.

2745
06:54:51.500 --> 06:55:11.500
But I think honestly, to just eliminate the statute of limitations where no one, no other state has done it, I think it would be, it would be, you know, it would take- Yeah, we know how you feel, Representative.

2746
06:55:11.500 --> 06:55:13.500
Right.

2747
06:55:13.500 --> 06:55:15.500
Mr.

2748
06:55:15.500 --> 06:55:22.000
Chairman, I'm wondering if anybody would, on any side, would change their vote.

2749
06:55:22.000 --> 06:55:27.500
In other words, would we get 11 people on interim study?

2750
06:55:27.500 --> 06:55:30.500
That's all I want to know.

2751
06:55:30.500 --> 06:55:32.500
That's a fair question.

2752
06:55:32.500 --> 06:56:26.000
And if't i don't see anybody so fine okay so we'll go with this i was sorry i was asking to say i i could see ways to change this that would be not complete elimination sort of like what we just talked about with the gun bill um something that's not complete elimination of statute of limitations but something that modifies it for pfas to make it different than other products because of the things that i think we discussed around the table so i would be happy to we could um representative uh truer um we could have um ITL or OTPA with an amendment.

2753
06:56:26.000 --> 06:56:28.000
That's a possibility.

2754
06:56:28.000 --> 06:56:30.000
I'm sorry.

2755
06:56:30.000 --> 06:56:33.500
I'm sorry, but I mean, we'd have...

2756
06:56:33.500 --> 06:56:48.500
I'm confused now because if if we did interim study, doesn't that mean that we're… Yeah, but interim study, we're now past interim study, because nobody was willing to change.

2757
06:56:48.500 --> 06:57:05.500
Well, sorry, that's what I was trying to say, was that I would support interim study versus… but perhaps what you're saying is that my change would not be the change we're looking for.

2758
06:57:05.500 --> 06:57:08.000
Okay, sorry about that then.

2759
06:57:08.000 --> 06:57:13.500
So let me just ask a follow-up to Representative Smith's question.

2760
06:57:13.500 --> 06:57:26.000
If there was a motion of interim study, would anybody that voted against ought to pass or for ITL vote in favor of interim study?

2761
06:57:26.000 --> 06:57:28.000
Mr.

2762
06:57:28.000 --> 06:58:01.000
Chair, for arguing between ITL and interim study, it doesn't matter because I believe that it effectively does the same thing this term so i'm okay voting for whatever i just don't want to spend the fall talking about this bill that i just think isn't workable so i'm okay either you know a complete death or a slow less painful death in that case Mr.

2763
06:58:01.000 --> 06:59:32.500
Jiggers,'t want representative alexander to consider death in any form um it wouldn't be right um i will i will move um interim study right is there a second oh yes of course i wanted to make a comment um i mean the only way to resolve the difference would be to change the length of the statute of limitations from six years to some other number it seems to me that would be the only the only potential change so why not just do it as a subcommittee do it in two weeks and we either move forward or we don't representative so when i was looking just to see because i know that we were previously told that no other state had done this with anything except for a dozen states relative to um childhood sexual abuse i did see that there were a few other states there were six other states that had pending legislation several of them have killed the bills but there's a few that have not yet so perhaps it's worth to see what some Thank you.

2764
06:59:32.500 --> 07:00:10.500
there were a few other states there were six other states that had pending legislation several of them have killed the bills but there's a few that have not yet so perhaps it's worth to see what some other states are doing and get more information from it i mean i think maybe some of them will give some sort of study information out of it i don't know did someone second in the interim study.

2765
07:00:10.500 --> 07:00:14.500
There was a motion for an interim study.

2766
07:00:14.500 --> 07:00:18.500
Well, but now there's a different proposal here.

2767
07:00:18.500 --> 07:00:29.000
It hasn't been seconded, and there's a proposal that we not vote today on this, and we vote in two weeks.

2768
07:00:29.000 --> 07:00:33.000
And at that point, we could vote ITL.

2769
07:00:33.000 --> 07:00:47.000
We're not likely to vote OTP, or we could vote OTPA if, for example, there was an amendment that lengthened, that extended the six years to something else.

2770
07:00:47.000 --> 07:00:49.000
Yes, Representative Saab.

2771
07:00:49.000 --> 07:01:15.000
I'd be okay voting for the interim study to kind of gather more data, but I guess I'm not sure what we would learn in just a week and changing, like, the number to be higher, because I will say in looking, like, we already have the highest number of six years.

2772
07:01:15.000 --> 07:01:50.000
Other states typically that I found i did look quickly but i looked through many states they had two or three years so i feel like if we want to hold it and actually look at kind of a study of information that would be okay but i'm not i wouldn't i wouldn't personally change my mind between this week and next week on just changing the number of years.

2773
07:01:50.000 --> 07:02:01.000
Sorry, one thought on this, because I guess in my head I'm thinking there is the lengthening of the statute of limitations.

2774
07:02:01.000 --> 07:02:14.000
There's also sort of, I guess, what I was trying to say earlier, this sort of idea between when or why would you bring your case?

2775
07:02:14.000 --> 07:02:23.000
Why wouldn't you bring it as soon as you thought you had the ability to bring the case?

2776
07:02:23.000 --> 07:02:29.000
Because it's sooner that you'll have it decided, hopefully in your favor.

2777
07:02:29.000 --> 07:02:35.000
So the idea of waiting a really long time, I'm not sure.

2778
07:02:35.000 --> 07:03:40.000
The only reason I can think to do that is because when you decide to bring that case, you have to have confidence that you're going to be able to prevail and it feels as though with all the emerging information about PFAS you might learn things later on that make you decide okay actually that is worth my while because there's costs involved in everything so I guess that would be my only other thought is something about substantially new information that would that would change the the decision as opposed to just lengthening but all right that's so so representative smith has moved i uh interim study is there a second i'll second that all right all right moved by um representative smith and seconded by Representative Alexander.

2779
07:03:40.000 --> 07:03:42.500
All right, any further discussion?

2780
07:03:42.500 --> 07:03:48.000
All right, I guess we're ready to call the roll then.

2781
07:03:48.000 --> 07:03:50.000
Vice Chairman Wallace.

2782
07:03:50.000 --> 07:03:52.000

Rep Perez.

2801

Rep Smith.

2802
07:04:30.000 --> 07:04:32.000
Rep Horrigan.

2803
07:04:32.000 --> 07:04:34.000
Yes.

2804
07:04:34.000 --> 07:04:36.000
Rep DiLorenzo.

2805
07:04:36.000 --> 07:04:38.000
Yes.

2806
07:04:38.000 --> 07:04:40.000
Rep Schultz?

2807
07:04:40.000 --> 07:04:42.000
Yes.

2808
07:04:42.000 --> 07:04:44.000
Rep Page?

2809
07:04:44.000 --> 07:04:46.000
Yes.

2810
07:04:46.000 --> 07:04:48.000
Rep Devine?

2811
07:04:48.000 --> 07:04:50.000
Yes.

2812
07:04:50.000 --> 07:04:52.000
Rep Lanza?

2813
07:04:52.000 --> 07:04:54.000
Yes.

2814
07:04:54.000 --> 07:04:56.000
Rep Manos?

2815
07:04:56.000 --> 07:04:58.000
Yes.

2816
07:04:58.000 --> 07:05:00.000
Rep Tur?

2817
07:05:00.000 --> 07:05:02.000
Yes.

2818
07:05:02.000 --> 07:05:04.000
Rep Howard?

2819
07:05:04.000 --> 07:05:06.000
Yes.

2820
07:05:06.000 --> 07:05:08.000
Chairman Lynn?

2821
07:05:08.000 --> 07:05:10.000
No.

2822
07:05:10.000 --> 07:05:12.500
Motion passes 14 to 6.

2823
07:05:12.500 --> 07:05:14.500
14 to 6.

2824
07:05:14.500 --> 07:05:16.500
All right.

2825
07:05:16.500 --> 07:05:22.000
So, so now, so we will go then with interim study.

2826
07:05:22.000 --> 07:05:24.000
Is that correct?

2827
07:05:24.000 --> 07:05:29.000
Because the other one, that's the only motion that passed.

2828
07:05:29.000 --> 07:05:31.000
So, all right.

2829
07:05:31.000 --> 07:05:39.000
So, so we know, we know one person that's not going to work on interim study.

2830
07:05:39.000 --> 07:05:48.000
I think Representative Smith is probably a great person to write the majority report and chair the committee.

2831
07:05:48.000 --> 07:05:54.000
Sounds like a great committee for you to chair in the fall.

2832
07:05:54.000 --> 07:05:56.000
All right.

2833
07:05:56.000 --> 07:05:59.000
So Representative Smith, you will write.

2834
07:05:59.000 --> 07:06:04.500
Well, do we do a report now with interim study now?

2835
07:06:04.500 --> 07:06:07.000
Do we do a report?

2836
07:06:07.000 --> 07:06:09.000
Yes.

2837
07:06:09.000 --> 07:06:13.000
For the second year, it has to go.

2838
07:06:13.000 --> 07:06:18.000
Do you want to do a minority report for ITO?

2839
07:06:18.000 --> 07:06:20.000
No, no, no.

2840
07:06:20.000 --> 07:06:22.000
That's fine.

2841
07:06:22.000 --> 07:06:24.000
All right.

2842
07:06:24.000 --> 07:06:27.500
So Representative Smith will write the report.

2843
07:06:27.500 --> 07:06:29.500
All right.

2844
07:06:29.500 --> 07:06:46.500
So we're now on to the last express my appreciation to representative all right so now we're on to the last bill that we have to deal with today and And that is 1104.

2845
07:06:46.500 --> 07:06:48.500
Hang on one second.

2846
07:06:48.500 --> 07:06:50.500
No, that's 1004.

2847
07:06:50.500 --> 07:06:53.000
Let me get to 1104.

2848
07:06:53.000 --> 07:06:55.000
Okay.

2849
07:06:55.000 --> 07:06:57.000
So 1104.

2850
07:06:57.000 --> 07:06:59.000
Okay.

2851
07:06:59.000 --> 07:07:04.000
So 1104, and I'm going to recognize myself to move.

2852
07:07:04.000 --> 07:07:07.000
I'm going to move amendment 0707H.

2853
07:07:07.000 --> 07:07:09.000
Is there a second?

2854
07:07:09.000 --> 07:07:11.000
Second by Representative Wallace.

2855
07:07:11.000 --> 07:07:33.500
And I guess what I just mentioned, I think I may have mentioned that in my testimony on this bill, the only real change made in this amendment is that, as I said before, this is kind of inside baseball for procedural issues for lawyers.

2856
07:07:33.500 --> 07:07:50.500
The original bill basically said that if the administrative judge or the chief judge to which one of these motions was made, that that judge's ruling would be final and not subject to appeal.

2857
07:07:50.500 --> 07:08:11.500
So, as I thought more about, I mean, that, the interest, that, whenever you make something not subject to appeal, I mean, one advantage of that is you, it makes it, you get, you can, you know, move the case more quickly.

2858
07:08:11.500 --> 07:08:16.500
But there's a, that's at a cost of some fairness.

2859
07:08:16.500 --> 07:08:36.000
And the more I thought about it, the more I thought, even though I think there is an interest in moving particularly marital cases where I think this often comes up, there is an interest in moving them along.

2860
07:08:36.000 --> 07:08:39.000
The fairness issue is also important.

2861
07:08:39.000 --> 07:08:51.500
So I changed it to say that the decision by the chief justice or the administrative judge is appealable, but it's appealable in this way.

2862
07:08:51.500 --> 07:09:47.000
If the judge to which the claim that an earlier judge who's been found to have committed misconduct, If the person claims that judge is ruling that judge's misconduct implicated my case in which out where I was harmed so the case now gets referred to the under the statute the case gets referred to the chief justice let's say of the of the Superior Court as I'm just an example if that judge finds that there is a reasonable likelihood that the judge's misconduct may have affected the decision in that litigant's case, then the judge will, the chief judge will, excuse me, will assign the case to another judge.

2863
07:09:47.000 --> 07:10:01.500
What this says is that ruling by the chief judge assigning the case, finding that there was a reasonable likelihood that misconduct affected the decision, cannot be appealed immediately.

2864
07:10:01.500 --> 07:11:05.500
In other words, because it is what is referred to as an interlocutory order the case is really not over so the judge the what this says is that the chief judge refers the case now to a new judge to to you know to look at this at this issue again and and perhaps to look at the underlying issue in, let's say, the divorce case again, that judge will then make a decision, and that decision can be appealed to the Supreme Court as part of that decision if the person who thought that the chief judge made a mistake in sending it to a new judge in the first place, if that litigant can raise that issue in the appeal from the new judge's order.

2865
07:11:05.500 --> 07:11:09.000
So the issue still can be decided.

2866
07:11:09.000 --> 07:11:12.000
It just can't be decided immediately.

2867
07:11:12.000 --> 07:11:14.500
That's what this language says.

2868
07:11:14.500 --> 07:11:20.000
And I know this, I see eyes glazing over here, okay?

2869
07:11:20.000 --> 07:11:22.500
But this can be important.

2870
07:11:22.500 --> 07:11:40.000
On the other hand, if the chief judge says, no, there is no connection between the misconduct of the judicial officer and the ruling in your case, so I'm dismissing your claim under this statute.

2871
07:11:40.000 --> 07:11:47.000
That is a final rule because that means the case, your case is over.

2872
07:11:47.000 --> 07:11:53.000
So that ruling can be appealed immediately because it's a final order.

2873
07:11:53.000 --> 07:12:04.500
That's, as I said, the lawyers in the room will kind of understand this, but the everybody else will have trouble with it.

2874
07:12:04.500 --> 07:12:06.500
But it is important.

2875
07:12:06.500 --> 07:12:08.500
It's 707.

2876
07:12:08.500 --> 07:12:10.500
0707H.

2877
07:12:10.500 --> 07:12:12.500
Representative Greason.

2878
07:12:12.500 --> 07:12:27.000
In the testimony that we heard, I picked up on a concern by some of those who are in, I guess they would be in favor of this bill.

2879
07:12:27.000 --> 07:12:29.000
I'm not sure exactly.

2880
07:12:29.000 --> 07:12:32.500
Some of them were a little confusing.

2881
07:12:32.500 --> 07:12:47.000
but there's there was the issue that they brought up was that they would get an unfavorable ruling, and they believed that that ruling was prejudiced by some misconduct.

2882
07:12:47.000 --> 07:13:00.000
And so the appeal would go to an administrative judge whom they have said was actually equally as corrupt or compromised as the original ruling judge.

2883
07:13:00.000 --> 07:13:14.500
And so what happens in that case if the administrative judge – they specifically mentioned the administrative judge – was what do you do in a case like that?

2884
07:13:14.500 --> 07:13:41.500
Who do you appeal to then if you believe that you're not even – because it says here in the language that the administrative judge shall determine with or without hearing whether there is reasonable likelihood that the misconduct of the judicial officer had a causal bearing on the challenged ruling decision or judgment.

2885
07:13:41.500 --> 07:13:50.500
And so you're going to take a prejudiced judgment, take it to a prejudiced judge for another hearing.

2886
07:13:50.500 --> 07:13:58.500
So where do you go after that when it's that intermediate step that's prejudiced as well?

2887
07:13:58.500 --> 07:14:00.500
Right.

2888
07:14:00.500 --> 07:14:02.500
Well, you know what?

2889
07:14:02.500 --> 07:14:07.000
Representative Terrer had raised that question with me earlier.

2890
07:14:07.000 --> 07:14:37.500
Actually, there is, if you read starting on the amendment on line six, if the judicial officer found to have committed misconduct is the chief justice of the Supreme Court, the chief justice of the Superior Court, or the administrative judge of the circuit court, the petition shall be filed with the most senior associate justice of the court in question.

2891
07:14:37.500 --> 07:15:11.500
So if the claim is that the boss, the chief justice, was somehow involved and was either committed to misconduct or was somehow involved in it, then you don't have to file with the chief justice was somehow involved in, was either committed to misconduct or was somehow involved in it, then you don't have to file with the chief justice, you file with the next senior judge.

2892
07:15:11.500 --> 07:15:25.000
And that's kind of the way, you know, there are other things in the, I think it's RSA 490 that deal with the same kind of thing.

2893
07:15:25.000 --> 07:15:33.500
If there's a basis for recusal for other reasons, it can go to the next most senior.

2894
07:15:33.500 --> 07:15:47.000
that that i think that that deals with that issue other representative manos thank you um i have a question on line 16 through 18 or 19.

2895
07:15:47.000 --> 07:16:08.000
okay um if there's a determination of a reasonable likelihood that the misconduct did have a causal bearing on the ruling, blah, blah, the justice shall vacate the ruling decision or judgment and remand the matter for rehearing before a judicial officer.

2896
07:16:08.000 --> 07:16:30.500
What I'm wondering about is wouldn't that leave the case, and they are typically domestic relations cases, but it doesn't matter, wouldn't that leave the case in the posture of having no order for some interim period of time until there could be a rehearing?

2897
07:16:30.500 --> 07:16:34.000
And I would be concerned about that.

2898
07:16:34.000 --> 07:16:42.500
Well, you know, but that's, I mean, in some sense, that's no different than any other reversal.

2899
07:16:42.500 --> 07:16:50.500
If the Supreme Court reverses, you know, an order in a marital case, there's no order.

2900
07:16:50.500 --> 07:16:56.500
There's no order in place until, you know, there's a new hearing.

2901
07:16:56.500 --> 07:17:00.500
So it's, I mean, in some sense, yes.

2902
07:17:00.500 --> 07:17:23.500
I suppose if the, you know, if there was some need for immediate relief after the reversal, I suppose one of the parties could go to the new judge and say, look, I need an emergency order for dealing with child support or something like that.

2903
07:17:23.500 --> 07:17:31.000
But I don't think that in that sense that's any different than any other reversal.

2904
07:17:31.000 --> 07:17:33.000
Right.

2905
07:17:33.000 --> 07:17:52.000
But I was going to say, if it's something like child support or visitation or joint custody decision making or residential placement of a child, you're leaving it in limbo where people need to live their immediate lives.

2906
07:17:52.000 --> 07:18:05.000
It's not like a case with, you know, damages X number of dollars or, you know, there are cases that people can live with a remand.

2907
07:18:05.000 --> 07:18:08.000
But these aren't typically those cases.

2908
07:18:08.000 --> 07:18:11.500
So I'm just I'm concerned about that.

2909
07:18:11.500 --> 07:18:17.000
Yeah, I mean, I you know, I hear what you're saying.

2910
07:18:17.000 --> 07:18:49.500
I guess I'm just not I don't see how that how in this case, in this situation, it's any than any in other words if Put aside judicial misconduct suppose that there's a judge issues a decision on child custody saying, you know This party gets the child That has primary custody and and the other party has the visitation every other weekend and weekend.

2911
07:18:49.500 --> 07:18:57.000
And the claim is that that was a wrong decision and the Supreme Court agrees.

2912
07:18:57.000 --> 07:19:01.000
And they vacate the decision and remand it.

2913
07:19:01.000 --> 07:19:08.000
The Supreme Court will not say, you know, this is what you should do.

2914
07:19:08.000 --> 07:19:12.000
They'll just say what you did was wrong.

2915
07:19:12.000 --> 07:19:22.000
And now, and so there will be some period of time before, you know, this is what you should do.

2916
07:19:22.000 --> 07:19:26.500
They'll just say you what you did was wrong.

2917
07:19:26.500 --> 07:19:36.500
And now, and so there will be some period of time before, you know, a new order can be entered.

2918
07:19:36.500 --> 07:19:41.500
I just don't see any, any way around that really.

2919
07:19:41.500 --> 07:19:54.000
If I may, I think, I think it could be changed to say that the ruling would not be, would be remanded, but not vacated.

2920
07:19:54.000 --> 07:20:07.000
And therefore the order that is complained about or said to have been influenced would stay in place until until there's a rehearing on the remand.

2921
07:20:07.000 --> 07:20:11.500
There's no reason to say that's to the beginning.

2922
07:20:11.500 --> 07:20:14.500
I'm sure I'm terrible they're not.

2923
07:20:14.500 --> 07:20:51.000
There's a determination, if there's a determination if there's a determination just hate the ruling decision or judgment remand um yeah they haven't heard the argument right so so how we know the decision's flawed sure well shell i guess i'm i mean i you know i i guess the thing i the the problem i have here is that i i still don't see how that would be any different than any.

2924
07:20:51.000 --> 07:20:57.000
In other words, if the, you know, put aside the misconduct situation.

2925
07:20:57.000 --> 07:20:59.000
Put aside this.

2926
07:20:59.000 --> 07:21:07.500
A trial judge makes a decision, and it goes to the Supreme Court, and they say wrong.

2927
07:21:07.500 --> 07:21:13.500
You know, they, I mean, it would be pretty unusual, I think.

2928
07:21:13.500 --> 07:21:31.000
I'm not saying it would never happen, but it would be pretty unusual for the court, for the Supreme Court to say reversed, but the original incorrect order remains in effect until there's another hearing.

2929
07:21:31.000 --> 07:21:37.000
I don't I think that would be pretty unusual to do that.

2930
07:21:37.000 --> 07:21:44.500
And so I wouldn't think of, you know, of a reason for doing that here.

2931
07:21:44.500 --> 07:21:46.500
So anyway.

2932
07:21:46.500 --> 07:21:48.500
All right.

2933
07:21:48.500 --> 07:21:53.000
So I know it's going back to the motion.

2934
07:21:53.000 --> 07:21:58.500
So is anybody else have anything to say on the amendment?

2935
07:21:58.500 --> 07:22:02.500
If not, are we ready for a vote?

2936
07:22:02.500 --> 07:22:26.000
And I think we might be able to do that for a show of hands are those in favor of the amendment if you'd raise your hand um any opposed all right so it looks like it's uh 20 to 19 19 i'm sorry 19 to 0.

2937
07:22:26.000 --> 07:22:38.500
uh all right hang on one second who second was that represent wallace two seconds yes okay um right i do i yes i 19.

2938
07:22:38.500 --> 07:22:50.000
oh all right and then on the uh on the main bill i would move uh otpa is there a second, all right.

2939
07:22:50.000 --> 07:22:55.000
And then on the main bill, I would move OTPA.

2940
07:22:55.000 --> 07:22:57.000
Is there a second?

2941
07:22:57.000 --> 07:22:59.000
Second.

2942
07:22:59.000 --> 07:23:01.000
All right.

2943
07:23:01.000 --> 07:23:05.000
Any further discussion on the bill as amended?

2944
07:23:05.000 --> 07:23:07.000
All right.

2945
07:23:07.000 --> 07:23:11.000
Then are we ready to call the roll?

2946
07:23:11.000 --> 07:23:13.000
All right.

2947
07:23:13.000 --> 07:23:17.000
I'd ask Representative Katop to call the roll.

2948
07:23:17.000 --> 07:23:19.000
Vice Chairman Wallace.

2949
07:23:19.000 --> 07:23:21.000
Yes.

2950
07:23:21.000 --> 07:23:23.000

Rep Smith.

2968

Rep Horrigan.

2970

Yes.

2971

Rep DeLorenzo.

2972

Yes.

2973
07:24:07.500 --> 07:24:09.500
Rep Schultz.

2974
07:24:09.500 --> 07:24:11.500
Yes.

2975

Rep Page.

2976

Yes.

2977

Rep Devine.

2978
07:24:17.500 --> 07:24:19.500
Yes.

2979

Rep Lanza.

2980

Yes.

2981

Rep Manos.

Rep Turrer.

Chairman Lynn.

2988

Yes.

2989
07:24:39.500 --> 07:24:42.000
Motion passes 19 to 0.

2990
07:24:42.000 --> 07:24:44.000
All right.

2991
07:24:44.000 --> 07:24:48.000
Any reason that this cannot go on consent?

2992
07:24:48.000 --> 07:24:50.000
Representative Lynn?

2993
07:24:50.000 --> 07:24:52.000
Yes.

2994
07:24:52.000 --> 07:24:58.000
It looks like we're going to have 10 bills on March 6th.

2995
07:24:58.000 --> 07:25:01.000
It's the week before town meetings.

2996
07:25:01.000 --> 07:25:05.500
I know I have tons of meetings and stuff.

2997
07:25:05.500 --> 07:25:12.500
Is there any possibility that we can move it to start at 9 a.m.?

2998
07:25:12.500 --> 07:25:23.000
So, I mean, I meeting at 5 o'clock and it has taken us three hours to get through four bills here.

2999
07:25:23.000 --> 07:25:41.000
All right so wait you know what hang on I will write I will just let me go back to 1104 let me go back to 1104 I will write the report since it's my bill.

3000
07:25:41.000 --> 07:25:43.000
So you know what?

3001
07:25:43.000 --> 07:25:45.000
Here's that.

3002
07:25:45.000 --> 07:25:47.000
You know, I'm I.

3003
07:25:47.000 --> 07:26:04.000
I was originally scheduling everything at nine o'clock and I got some pushback from people, which I understood that saying that they it made a real problem So let's push it back to 10.

3004
07:26:04.000 --> 07:26:08.000
My inclination, Representative Perez, is to do this.

3005
07:26:08.000 --> 07:26:20.500
I know we will have a lot of bills on for the 6th, but that will not be our drop-dead date to get bills done.

3006
07:26:20.500 --> 07:26:25.000
So I would prefer to start at 10 o'clock.

3007
07:26:25.000 --> 07:26:28.500
Hopefully we get through all the bills.

3008
07:26:28.500 --> 07:27:03.000
it starts to get late and then you know and it and it's uh it looks like we're going to be going until you know five o'clock that day starting at 10 maybe we'll just sort of re we'll we'll stop and and uh move on and do the you know do the following wednesday to finish up whatever we have to do that would be be my suggestion.

3009
07:27:03.000 --> 07:27:29.000
Well, what time will you have to do that would be my suggestion well what what time will you have to leave oh no no that's fine so so you know i i i can't imagine that we i'm sorry representative paris do you know why we are here so late today?

3010
07:27:29.000 --> 07:27:31.000
Yeah.

3011
07:27:31.000 --> 07:27:37.000
We could have voted on it today and then we win again.

3012
07:27:37.000 --> 07:27:50.500
Yeah, I mean, that's not really a fair criticism of Representative Perez, because we've talked about the same bill three times and have not voted once yet.

3013
07:27:50.500 --> 07:27:52.500
So, that's right.

3014
07:27:52.500 --> 07:27:57.500
And I don't think I would have taken much time.

3015
07:27:57.500 --> 07:28:06.500
The Democrats are planning a caucus until nine o'clock in the morning on the 6th without anything else.

3016
07:28:06.500 --> 07:28:14.000
And we're not going to meet on Sunday or Monday or Tuesday of that week.

3017
07:28:14.000 --> 07:28:20.000
So I would have some real problems if we started at 9.

3018
07:28:20.000 --> 07:28:26.000
Yeah, it would be really difficult for me to start at 9.

3019
07:28:26.000 --> 07:28:33.000
I'd rather add in another day than start at 9 if that's the alternative.

3020
07:28:33.000 --> 07:28:40.500
I think all of us can use some restraint in how long we go on.

3021
07:28:40.500 --> 07:28:44.000
And I put myself on that list.

3022
07:28:44.000 --> 07:28:47.500
So here's what I'm going to do.

3023
07:28:47.500 --> 07:29:09.000
I'm going to, just so everybody knows, what I'm going to do, I will sometime probably tomorrow or Friday, I will ask Karen to do an amended notice that will put on for executive session on March 6th all of our remaining bills.

3024
07:29:09.000 --> 07:29:16.000
I suspect that we may not get through all of them on that day.

3025
07:29:16.000 --> 07:29:23.500
And once we don't, then we will have a continued executive session the following Wednesday.

3026
07:29:23.500 --> 07:29:27.000
But we will start at 10 a.m.

3027
07:29:27.000 --> 07:29:29.000
on both those days.

3028
07:29:29.000 --> 07:29:42.500
And just Representative Perez, just so I know that you were very concerned about this, the first bill we will take up on March 6th is 1283.

3029
07:29:42.500 --> 07:29:46.500
We will do that first at 10 o'clock.

3030
07:29:46.500 --> 07:29:55.000
I think we've had, you know, people will have plenty of time to have considered the amendment.

3031
07:29:55.000 --> 07:29:58.000
They will also consider your amendment.

3032
07:29:58.000 --> 07:30:05.000
And we should be, you know, we'll have a continuing debate on the bill.

3033
07:30:05.000 --> 07:30:10.000
I know that there are strong feelings on both sides.

3034
07:30:10.000 --> 07:30:35.500
we'll have a we'll have a a continuing debate on the bill I know that there will there are strong feelings on both sides and we'll have a vote and and then we'll move on to the other bills right yeah no no I hear you And I think we should.

3035
07:30:35.500 --> 07:31:02.000
Yeah, I guess the only question, I mean, the only thing I guess I would say, Representative Perez, is it's the, your arguments might have been stronger, I guess I would say, if you were saying, and if you make, let's make this change and then that will make it an acceptable bill.

3036
07:31:02.000 --> 07:31:06.500
But if I understood correctly, maybe I misunderstood you.

3037
07:31:06.500 --> 07:31:14.000
My understanding from what you had said the meeting before was it was really nothing.

3038
07:31:14.000 --> 07:31:19.500
If we did everything that you pointed out as a criticism.

3039
07:31:19.500 --> 07:31:21.500
I never said that.

3040
07:31:21.500 --> 07:31:23.500
I never said that.

3041
07:31:23.500 --> 07:31:29.500
I was telling you the fact that this was a bad bill.

3042
07:31:29.500 --> 07:31:33.000
I was not going after the intent.

3043
07:31:33.000 --> 07:31:35.500
I have always said this.

3044
07:31:35.500 --> 07:31:46.000
I have always said that it's a bad bill and that it was the intent had nothing to do with it.

3045
07:31:46.000 --> 07:31:50.000
No, no, I'm not talking about the intent.

3046
07:31:50.000 --> 07:32:09.500
What I'm saying is, if I understood correctly, you were saying that, not that people had bad intent, but that there was nothing, that there were no amendments that could be made that would make you support the bill.

3047
07:32:09.500 --> 07:32:28.000
And so I guess the point that I have some difficulty with is if there's, you know, when you say, well, they, you know, they don't have to, nobody has to witness the person taking the medication.

3048
07:32:28.000 --> 07:32:41.000
I hadn't heard you say, well, and if you put that in, you know, and you do all the other things, I'll vote for the bill.

3049
07:32:41.000 --> 07:32:43.000
That could persuade me.

3050
07:32:43.000 --> 07:32:49.500
So I'm, you know, that I'm not saying you don't get me wrong.

3051
07:32:49.500 --> 07:32:55.500
I'm not saying you didn't have the right to make your argument.

3052
07:32:55.500 --> 07:32:58.500
I'm not saying that at all.

3053
07:32:58.500 --> 07:33:00.500
That's fine.

3054
07:33:00.500 --> 07:33:02.500
But I do.

3055
07:33:02.500 --> 07:33:05.000
But I but I do.

3056
07:33:05.000 --> 07:33:09.500
I'm in terms of the persuasiveness of your arguments.

3057
07:33:09.500 --> 07:34:28.500

We want to hear it.

3061
07:34:35.000 --> 07:34:42.500

3069
07:35:00.500 --> 07:35:08.000
