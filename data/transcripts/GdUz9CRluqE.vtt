representing clamont and
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
Cen I bring before the committee for
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
their consideration an amendment to
 
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
house so Senate Bill
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
458 we're trying to amend in the chapter
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
318 which deals with pharmacies and
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist the ability to work with a
 
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.710 align:start position:0%
pharmacist the ability to work with a
license

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
for what I call a mini Pharmacy with
 
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
allowing clinics like Hamp oncology and
 
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
oncology to have a small Pharmacy within
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
the confines of the clinic for the
 
00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:46.790 align:start position:0%
the confines of the clinic for the
patient

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
populations what I found in trying to
 
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
31847 most of it had to be modified in
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
31837 and by moving it to a different
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
section of the RSA it was considered to
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
be n gerain so why move it from 47 to 37
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally what caused some of
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
confusion in the RSA as is written today
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
if you look at line nine on the
 
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
amendment you'll see it says here for
 
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
the sale at retail of drugs in medicines
 
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
even though the board felt they had the
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
authority to issue a license to a clinic
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacy if there was concerned that the
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
word retail which is really general
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
public was causing confusion so by
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating the
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
phrase at retail it minimizes that
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
reference um it does allow for the board
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
at that point in time to issue a permit
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to be open to the
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
public so at that point in time you
 
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
could have it for a Nuclear Pharmacy
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
which they could do today you could have
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
for a Clinic Pharmacy you could have for
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
a Hospital Pharmacy the boards found
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
creative ways to minimize the impact of
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
the word retail which is basically
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
Community Pharmacy but by eliminating
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
this out of the statute today it does
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
allow the boort greater latitude and
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility to address the different
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
growing needs of War Pharmacy being
 
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
practice and with that I'll take
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
Weber so am I correct to understand that
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
the board has rules
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
under that that apply to the various
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
sorts of pharmacies yes okay correct so
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
this would simply allow them to make
 
00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 align:start position:0%
rules for different
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
situations and continue their
 
00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate oversight cor right thank
 
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
you representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant for working so hard on this um
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
my question is that we're sort of
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this mini Pharmacy idea and
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
my concern with this language is that
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
may be seen as a more one-sized fits-all
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy that may have may assume needs
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
that these in provider office pharmacies
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't actually have and then
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
therefore have requirements that aren't
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the situation does the
 
00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board currently have different
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
sets of rules for different types of
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
pharmacies yes we yes we do okay we have
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
rules for
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
yeah actually as a followup do you mind
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
mentioning just a couple of the
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
different types we have rules for
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
Community Pharmacy and you can have an
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
ACC Community Pharmacy you can license
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
the whole store you can license only the
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
prescription Department you can also
 
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
have what they call Central field
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy which is not open to the public
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
today which only processes prescriptions
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
that are centralized and in send them to
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
the retail pharmacy for distribution to
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
the patients you have a Nuclear Pharmacy
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
you have um Long-Term Care Pharmacy you
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
have home Infusion pharmacy that's why
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
the board felt they probably could use
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
what they have today in statute to issue
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
a license for this location but by
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
removing the word retail it opens up or
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
minimizes if you will the some of the
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
barriers that were there in the
 
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.990 align:start position:0%
barriers that were there in the
past

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
kman thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
for uh bringing the amendment and taking
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
my question representative um we had
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
discussed uh that I I had some concerns
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
about um Physicians having full
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
pharmacies um in their practices simply
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
because there used to be um this kind of
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
whining and dining of Physicians where
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical companies would give
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
them samples and would incentivize them
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
to prescribe certain medications and I
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
think this um might be opening the door
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
for um some unethical practices and I
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
know that most doctors wouldn't do that
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
but um it has occurred in the past and
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I was hoping that there would be some
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
language in here about um disclosing to
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
the patient if if they have any
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
financial interest in prescribing
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
medication um and dispensing it to them
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything about that what can
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
you say no there's nothing in there for
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
that um I though I think we could put
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
something through to amend the non-
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment going down the road I
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
think one of the things also I heard was
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
the question of for patients for which
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get to maybe conflict
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
of interest is being sure the patient
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
understands they have the freedom of
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
choice they don't have to go to that
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy if it's in side of the clinic
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
they should be informed at that point in
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
time that they have always reserved the
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
right to go to any pharmacy they want to
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
it's their of their right if you will to
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
take their prescription and take it
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
wherever they want to if it's convenient
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
for them and it makes sense for them
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
they want to do it there b means it's
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
disclosed to them that's their choice
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
and their option but I think to your
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
point representative Coachman is the
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
fact that they should be clear they have
 
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.069 align:start position:0%
fact that they should be clear they have
that

00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
option other questions representative
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
Weber as a followup to that would it
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
be true that because of this
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
amendment the um medications are under
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy board rather than the
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
medical side of things and therefore
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
that prevent that that provides some
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
insulation and some oversight
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
specifically R relating to the dispens
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
ing side of things which would just in
 
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
and of itself provide a certain barrier
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
there it does provide a barrier the
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy we have um in our
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
rules ethic guidelines and one of the
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
ethic guidelines is a Prohibition on
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
splitting the fee or splitting any
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
revenue between the pharmacist and the
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
position thank
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative Lon
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
taking another question representative
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
Merchant um I I know that you're aware
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
of RSA 415 colon 6-t which is the oral
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer therapies is the parity law
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
for insurance premiums uh my question
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
would be since I don't want to craft the
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
actual law that stays in statute to be
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
too specific to any one um need but um
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you would be open to
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
having um some legislative intent that's
 
00:11:25.949 --> 00:11:25.959 align:start position:0%
in here that does go into the session
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
law stating that the reason for this
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
Bill coming specifically was to allow
 
00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:34.519 align:start position:0%
you know basically in practice parody
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
with oral cancer medication with the
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
injectable the infusion-based um Can
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
anti-cancer medications and we
 
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
recognized that there may be broader
 
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
scope in applications so we didn't want
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
us to restrict the language but we
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to enable this with um
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
streamlined regulation in order to do
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
this is that something that you'd be
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
willing to look and help work with me on
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
be willing to discuss it with you repr
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
Leon I think right now with the parody
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
that's true no matter what pharmacy they
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
go to so that will hold in that section
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
with 406 that parody applies to all um
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
dispensing functionality now I think
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
when I need to go back and look at the
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
RSA specifically if it only deals a
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
parody with infused drugs versus
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
prescribed drugs for dispensing all
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
medications if you will so does does
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
statute say clearly it's oral
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
medications as well as infused that I
 
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
don't know as a followup follow um
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
with a followup um I I can check that
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
and see but my my intention was that
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
since we're looking at prescribing
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
parity um that to have a note that I
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
know this one is about the insurance
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
coverage but the intent the point is
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
that the infusible anti-cancer
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
medications have their own risks as well
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
and the transfer to the at home with the
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
oral cancer medicines that we need to
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
look at the fact that these doctors are
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
already doing it an office I I think
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
that would take a different um amend
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
that statute thing to amend it try to
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
amend it here number one it gets into
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce it gets into insurance policy
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
which is not what we're talking about
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
here today with this amendment
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
Weber would you agree with me
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant that when we put
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
something into chapter law it gets
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
buried and if we write a report for the
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
house which is the record of the house
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
and which is also a record of our intent
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislature uh that is is far more
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
available to people and we could state
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
in our committee report our intent and
 
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
thereby preserve it clearly without
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
having to put it into statute or re
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
amend things that be restive um we
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
that's definitely one way to attack it
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
to address it thank you other
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.189 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

also signed up to speak is Dr Peter Crow
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%

oncology hematology specialist at New
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oncology hematology I appear
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
before you today with no position on the
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendment presented by representative
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant on SB
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
458 however there are a few issues that
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'd like to raise with the proposed
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
language as I stated just a few short
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
weeks ago when uh we asked Senator avar
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
to file this legislation as a result of
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy's de uh
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling that found that our
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
request to dispense non-controlled
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs in order to meet
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
patients immediate medical needs was
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
outside the board's
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction new have tonology was
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
simply seeking statutory Clarity move
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
before moving forward with any plans to
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
dispense oral anti-cancer medications we
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
heard the concerns of other stakeholders
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
after the initial public Hearing in the
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
Senate and attempted to develop language
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to dispense a 30day
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
supply of or oral anti-cancer
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
medications consistent with the regular
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
course of treat
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh that also put appropriately guard
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate guard rails in place in
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
statute and directing the Board of
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy to promate rules for this type
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
of practice we believe that this
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
targeted approach was appropriate so
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's not to disrupt or or open the
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
entire permitting process that already
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
currently exists we appreciate and
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
understand the path that representative
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
Merchant would like to pursue regarding
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
creating additional options for pharmacy
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
permitting within the state of New
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire however as I stated we do have
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
some concerns regarding The Proposal
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
within the language there is no
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislative intent or directive as to
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
what exactly the Board of Pharmacy
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
should promulgate rules for our
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that representative
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
Merchant envisions that the board
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
develop rules for numerous Specialties
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
and additional permitting types we also
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
understand that this process is subject
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
to and allows consideration of public
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
comment along with legislative approval
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
without additional intent in the bill
 
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that any permit type
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
that would seek to govern our practice
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
would be uh will be overly
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
burdensome I will remind the committee
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we are already subject to Federal
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
Regulations that we follow USP 797 and
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
800 guidelines that are certified by the
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
quality on and are certified by the
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
quality oncology practice initiative
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
under the American Society of clinical
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
oncology we will never have the
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
complexity of drugs nor will we have the
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
volume of drugs coming through our
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
practice that other retail institutional
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
pharmacies have finally while we know
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is unique our
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Maine and Vermont have
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
already passed narrow regulations for
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
the practice of physician dispensing in
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
their states we would request that
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
similar a similar concept be adopted
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
here again we stop this change in order
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
to for us to better serve our patients
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
without any unnecessary delays to better
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
ensure coordination between our
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
providers and patients and to optimize a
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
patient's adherence to their treatment
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time today and I'd be
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions okay thank you
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
um m do you want to speak first or or do
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
you want to no I'm just here to answer
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative kersman thank
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um can you just repeat
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
those two states that you mentioned that
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
have some limited um physician
 
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.990 align:start position:0%
have some limited um physician
dispensing

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
dispensing
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
law well I reference Maine and Vermont
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
um it's actually much broader than that
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
but the but Maine and Vermont are the
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know because they're immediately
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
adjacent to us but there are the this
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
our efforts here have been supported Ed
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
by a practice similar to ours in Maine
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
who has an office in Portsmith and they
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
have they have essentially much fewer um
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
regulations than what we what has been
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
discussed here if I can just follow up
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
on that representative um in Maine in
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont um they the um statuto there
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
statutory language in both states that
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
allows for physician dispensing of drugs
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
um with very limited um oversight
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
regarding storage and labeling
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
and New York as well there it's there
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
there are many other states in the in
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
the country that are where that's true
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
but the there's there's different rules
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
kind of throughout the country but but
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
um I know New York is also has a has a
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
exception followup thank you um can you
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
delve into a little bit further about
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
the um oversight on storage and labeling
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
and what you would rather see here
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the other
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
states so um I do have um only one copy
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
um but I do have copies of what is
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
applicable um law in Maine and Vermont
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
um and excuse me um in Vermont it's um
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
basically that Physicians who dispense
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
regulated drug shall have fixed to The
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
Container a label showing the dispensing
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners name address and registry
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
number the name address and the patient
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
kind and form of the drug contained um
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
um unless the dispensing practitioner
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
considers that information should not be
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
specified um in the date of the issuance
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the prescription in the drug um and
 
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799 align:start position:0%
then in main um Physicians are allowed
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
to dispense um as long as they have the
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
proper and safe storage of drugs and
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
devices and the maintenance of proper
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
records for drugs and devices um and
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
then there's a whole section on labeling
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
as well which is pretty similar to what
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont
 
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.430 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont
has

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
follow thank thank you and what do you
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
see the um regulations potentially being
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
without the legislative intent um that
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy might come up with
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
or Institute for these um for the
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacies here that would be different
 
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.390 align:start position:0%
pharmacies here that would be different
from

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont I mean I'm not really
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
sure that we can speak to that because
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
we have not had we've had a couple of
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
discussions with a few members of the
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy but we don't know
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
right now what those would be um and I
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
to some degree we would be willing to
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
you know have some sort of regulations
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
in place that were similar for storing
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
and and labeling um but obviously the
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
the devil's in the details and um we
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what the Board of Pharmacy
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
Weber so am I right to understand that
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
in in Maine and Vermont there is no
 
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
oversight by the Board of Pharmacy at
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
all it's just done under the physic Ians
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
or providers
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
license yes and no um in Vermont my
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's done under
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
the well it says possession and control
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
of regulated drugs so it must be done
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
under the pharmacy statute um and then
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
in main it is the um under the the
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacy act but I'm not sure what kind
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
of reg whether the Board of Pharmacy
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
comes in to inspect um and I guess to
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
that point to
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire oncology hematology is
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
um under the jurisdiction of the Board
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy and I think we've mentioned
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
that a couple of times with their
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
infusion practice the Board of Pharmacy
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
is currently um able to come in and
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
inspect um should they they believe that
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
something um arise is has come up or is
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
going on um and you know we would pretty
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
much like to see something similar that
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
transition to oral anti-cancer medicine
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
as well um I know just from my
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
conversations with the with the main
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
practice that the uh the Board of
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy does not come in to their
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
office and um um they're not directly
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
involved with with the with their oral
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
dispensing operation
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
there follow so I'm needing some CL
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
clarification as a result of that last
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
answer which is that um if our Board of
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy here in New Hampshire is
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
infusions how is what this amendment
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
proposes which is simply to give them
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
broader Authority in other cases going
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
to make things any different than the
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
overseeing of infusions that they
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
already do I'm not understanding why
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
this makes things more difficult for
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
you well I I think as Gina said a minute
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
ago I think it all depends on the on the
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
details of the of what those rules are
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
so the right now it I I think as as
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
we've discussed with Doc with u
 
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.870 align:start position:0%
we've discussed with Doc with u
representative

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
Merchant um having some broad rules that
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
would sort of um mirror what we've done
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
over the years with the Board of
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy I think that would that would
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
that would not be of a concern for us
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what those rules will
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
be and um and you could easily imagine
 
00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.190 align:start position:0%
be and um and you could easily imagine
them

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
um being more restrictive which could
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
create which could create issues for us
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
sure why would they be more
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
restrictive with the prescription of
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
pills than they are with
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
infusions so I I see represent Merchant
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
over in the corner kind of raising his
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
hand and you will correct me if I'm
 
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
hand and you will correct me if I'm
wrong

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative my understanding is that
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
there's sort of an agreement between the
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy and the Board of
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
Medicine regarding the inspection of
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
Physicians practices relative to
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
infusions that there's no rule so to
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
speak in place and I could be completely
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
wrong but that was my
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
understanding may I speak May answer it
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
sure um what transpired several years
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
ago was the confusion between
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
compounding and Drug preparation
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
and it created a lot of tension between
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy and the Board of
 
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.269 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy and the Board of
Medicine

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
Medicine
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
that created us down a path where when
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking at something that's
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
following strictly the package insert
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
that at that point in time is considered
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
drug preparation and not under the Board
 
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy per se if you deviate from
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
the package insert which a lot of
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy does today once you do that
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
then you're under the jurisdiction of
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy is your
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
compounding not finishing the product
 
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
preparation from the FDA oversight so
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's where we have Pharmacy oversight
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
because compounding is strictly a
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
pharmacy right within the state and
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
nationally so that's where the Board of
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy goes into the clinics to be
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
sure that when they're doing compounding
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's being done correctly aseptically
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
and so forth so the board has a
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
oversight in that Arena but they
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
following strictly the package insert
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
and and not deviating from it it's Dru
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
compounding and I think just to clarify
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
too and I um just checked with Dr Crow
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire oncology hematology has
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
infusions that they um administer that
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
are separate from the chemo
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
administration too which as represent
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
Merchant just mentioned is is two
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
completely different things relative to
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
compounding and
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
um the other one
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
reconstitution it's is cor preparation
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
because basically what happens is when
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
the product is
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
manufactured it comes in a powder
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes lopiz and a vial or some form
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
that you have to take a last step before
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
you can use it for a patient so you have
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
to take the powder if you will and Recon
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
it with some sort of solution in order
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
to create infusion and that's considered
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
following the package insert by the
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
FDA once you change like I said you take
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
any deviation from that package insert
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're considered to be compounding and
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
separation representative representative
 
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I think it's my
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
understanding one of the Genesis of this
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
amendment uh was the fact that there was
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
concern that you know we're dealing with
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
some very powerful drugs here and that
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
if there was an error or Omission or
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
something that happened you know with
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
respect to administering the drugs and
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of the amendment is to
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
kind of bring in an independent double
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
check okay to kind of put the brakes on
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
to have something outside of you know
 
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
what you're doing to stop pause and
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
verify um and I didn't see anything that
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
kind of addressed that in the original
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
bill so my understanding is that concern
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
still exists absent this amendment so
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
can you speak to um Maine can you speak
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
to Vermont can you speak to your own
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
practice as to how that concern would be
 
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.750 align:start position:0%
practice as to how that concern would be
addressed

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
absent this
 
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.190 align:start position:0%
absent this
amendment

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to answer your question then
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
if I don't answer it please let me know
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
and I can try again um so the um there
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
are the the clinical issues with with
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
prescribing and administering the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
treatments and then there are there's
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
kind of the Regulatory and oversight
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
stuff so the in terms of the the
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
clinical issues with my
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
prescribing chemotherapy or as G was
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
referring to some of these other
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
adjunctive drugs that we give in the
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
office those I write a prescription
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're prepared the within the office
 
00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:11.799 align:start position:0%
our Pharmacy oversees the the you know
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
the the actual order to make sure that
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate our our farm techs
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
prepare it there's a double check to
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's prepared correctly
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
the nurses triple check it to make sure
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
that it's being that everything is the
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
way it should be there's a whole process
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
that goes through with that and the same
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
thing would happen to a more limited
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
degree with oral prescriptions they're
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
they're less complicated than the
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
infusions because instead of our having
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
to reconstitute and and sort and um go
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
through that whole process it's a
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
prescription but we would have the we
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
would have similar checks in place for
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
that I think in terms of maybe what
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
you're getting at with the question
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
though is there's there are the
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
regulatory there's the regulatory
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
oversight of the whole practice and
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
making sure that things are being done
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
in a way where the where the right the
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
where where the right processes are in
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
place and where the the the um medicines
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
are being the particularly the
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
intravenous medicines are being prepared
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
in a sterile Manner and and um all those
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
other factors those are there are many
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
um different layers of Regulation that
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
we go through as I alluded to before
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
there federal regulations that we go
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
through uh that we have to comply with
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
in order to for to have our our Pharmacy
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
in place and so those those things are
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
are already there we have to meet
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
various um Quality metrics for um some
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
of them are are for you know are are
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
General accreditation and then some of
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
them are for when we when we're working
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
with an insurance company to make sure
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
that you know that that that were kind
 
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
of approved particularly with the oral
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
medications we'd have to sort of show
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
that we're doing things in the right way
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
so those things are all in place and
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
they're the the they I will say with
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
great confidence that there are that
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are many different layers of of
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
quality control in the way that that our
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
are that these prescriptions are are
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
handled um in the office and um and I
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
think to to the last point of your
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
question I think in Maine and in in
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont quite frankly I think what has
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
been decided is there's enough oversight
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
in those other manner in those other
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
areas that they don't need that that
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
they don't need State oversight uh for
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
that follow up thank you Mr chair and
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not trying to be difficult
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just really trying to understand so
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
um so you're so you're talking about you
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
know the thing is done it's checked then
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
the nurse checks it so this all sounds
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
like best practice um but there may be
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
differences you know uh facility to
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
facility so those best practices that
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about are those already
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
regulated or is that just something that
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
you internally have implemented um or is
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
that something that's already regulated
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
that these best practices must be done
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
as part of that framework that you were
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
talking about a little bit of both so
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
the the the federal Pharmacy regulations
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
those are those are there and and you
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
know you have to meet those and those
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
are you know those are those are those
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
are not sort optional essentially um
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
some of the other sort of the layers
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
that I was talking about those are more
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
best practices and you don't you don't
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
100% need to do those things and and um
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
but I think most I would say most
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
oncology practices do do those things
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
and I think because there's a whole
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
another layer to this which is which is
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursed and if we will not
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
get reimbursed if we can't if we can't
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the quality of the practice
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
the quality of our practice so that's
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
all outside of Regulation and other
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
stuff that's the real world stuff about
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
about getting about getting paid and
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is a factor with the
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
oral prescriptions that um you know
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're we are happy to assume the
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility of Meeting those other
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
metrics because we know that a it's good
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
for patients and B we're confident in
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
our ability to do
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
it and I think I would just add but this
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
is the first step the first step is
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
getting legislative Clarity that legally
 
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
they are able to dispense these drugs
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
and then all of the other things will
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
come after and there's a huge amount of
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
cost associated with those things and so
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
this is I think we talked about this in
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
the previous hearing but we we can't
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
commit to spending to to spending all
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
that money as an independent practice
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
unless we know that we're going to be
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
able that we're not going to run a foul
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
of of state law and that's why we've
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
been kind of stuck with
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
this yeah representative Lon um thank
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you doctor for
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
being here um I'm hoping I could use
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
your expertise for um to answer a
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
question related to another bill that
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
had started in this committee and is
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
over in finance um currently are there
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
therapies available for every um cancer
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
or are we still looking for therapies
 
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:26.269 align:start position:0%
or are we still looking for therapies
for

00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
some uh well that's a hard one to answer
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
there are therapies I the there are some
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
cancers where there are fewer and less
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
effective therapies so you could kind of
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
debate um you know they're very there's
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
no cancer that I can think of where
 
00:33:44.909 --> 00:33:44.919 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that we would ever talk
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
about with a patient but there's some
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
there there are some there actually more
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
than I would like circumstances where we
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
have those conversations and we don't
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
have treatments in which we have great
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
confidence and and so there's more of a
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
discussion about should we do something
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
rather than you know what are we going
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
to do thank you that was incredibly
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you reprentative Murphy
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
and then representative kushman thank
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
my question just from you know forget
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
the regulatory part of it forget all the
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
oversight Etc how would this bill
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
without this bill and without the bill
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
as amended how will this affect the
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
quality of care that you were able to
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
give your
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
patients well it undermines quality of
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
care thatf typically how
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
so as things exist now with these oral
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
medicines I do a
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
prescription our office goes through an
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
extensive financial review with
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
insurance to see what's going to cover
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
and you know what the out of pocket's
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to be all the all these other
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
things I then it the the prescription
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
gets reviewed by our pharmacist and
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
everything everybody else and our nurses
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's appropriate it
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
gets sent to a specialty Pharm
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
typically out of state very rarely in
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
state they that then gets filled and and
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the to the patient we have to
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the patient when to
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
start it and there's off you it's a
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
surprisingly complicated thing to do
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
that because people get confused
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
something arrives in the mail and they
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to start taking it
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we want to make sure that
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page about when
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
they start it and then as I think we
 
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.390 align:start position:0%
they start it and then as I think we
discussed

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
previously most of these medicines we
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
see a patient well well our nurses call
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and touch base make sure things are
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
going okay we see a patient a week or
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
two after they've started the medicine
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
we check their blood CS or other labs
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have to we we often have to
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
hold the medicine and reduce the dose
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
but at that point the when the
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
prescriptions are being are being filled
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
by a specialty pharmacy it's very hard
 
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
to coordinate those changes in real time
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
with a specialty pharmacy so the
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
prescriptions are either being sent too
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
early at the wrong dose or they're being
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
sent late and delaying treatment or
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
we're having to to sort of make up a
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
dose to sort of modify because they get
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
500 milligram pills and we want to
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
reduce it by 100 milligram you know so
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
so there's all kinds of of compromises
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
that we have to make clinically in order
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
to to to uh adjust for those
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies and if we were to do what
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
has been proposed with this
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
conversation I would see a patient I
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
would say I'm going to reduce the dose
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
by whatever amount that would again be
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed by our staff and everything and
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
then the patient would go to the
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacy in the office and get the new
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
prescription have it in hand when they
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
leave the office and be ready to make
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
the adjustments as we discussed so
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's the simplest version of it sorry
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
for not being simple thank you that's
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
very helpful because it does give a a
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
sense about the quality of care so the
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to that is that if
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
this bill were not passed or passed as
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
amended would it impact you negatively
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
financially in your practice yes it
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
would okay thank you
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative kushman thank you Mr
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
um M uh representative McLean's question
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
kind of got me thinking um you've got
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
pharmacists in your practice to be that
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
check on the prescriptions on the on the
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
Physicians orders if this amendment as
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it um would basically allow
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
any physician to get a pharmacy
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
dispensing license um for dispensing
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
medication from their
 
00:37:35.309 --> 00:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
practice um would that second check with
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
that pharmac pharmacist oversight then
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
be removed in those
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances well and I I don't want to
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
get um outside my Lane here but um I'll
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
give you my opinion so
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
um our
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
practice a big part of what we do is we
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
do chemotherapy so that's that is how we
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
take care of our patients that's how we
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
generate Revenue um the uh so we have
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
all these PL all these structures in
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
place um be because we need to for for
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
oral anlytics or for analytics in
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
general we need those structures in
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
place and that is true for oral
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
analytics as
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
well when the when the bill was
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
originally written in the Senate It Was
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
Written very narrow
 
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.589 align:start position:0%
Written very narrow
because

00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
our situation is unique in medicine
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
there really is no other situation in
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
medicine where the where infusion where
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
these types of treatments are are
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
prominent a prominent enough part of the
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
practice that that you'll have a
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and a and all those other
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
structures in place there's many areas
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
where it's kind of started to expand
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
that way but not to a degree where for
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
example in Rheumatology or Dermatology
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
or where where some of these things are
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
given there's just not enough volume
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
there for them to to make the investment
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
they would need to in order to create
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
those those types of those types of
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
support systems and I think if you when
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
you open it
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
up it makes it more complicated it makes
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
it more complicated for the Board of
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy um because they're going to
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
need to sort of put in those to put in
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
those those protections because what we
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
do is just not the same as what other
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
what other parts of medicine do um and
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
and I will say to to go back to a
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
question from before you know why would
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
the rules be complicated I think my
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
concern and I I My Hope Is and it sounds
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
like maybe the rules would not be
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
complicated but my concern is that as
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
rules are created to cover other
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
Specialties in medicine they will then
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
start to to lose the they'll start to
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
put lose the the put more uh
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are not really um
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
gerine to what we do but but they'll
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
have because it's a broader because it's
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
a you're covering broader circumstances
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
there you kind of Lo it's it it gets
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
more complicated and um the and that's
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
you know that would be that would be
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
part of my concern about
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
it representative South King thank you
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair very quick question no
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
explanation needed would you you prefer
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
us to pass the original unamended Bill
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
the amended or
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
nothing I would prefer to pass the
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
original unamended Bill thank you other
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you I think
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
there's just one more thing um that I
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention so um we have a letter
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
here from um executive director Lindsay
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
Courtney um we had talked with her about
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not she believed that um
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
there may need to be a statutory fix in
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
order for um New Hampshire oncology he
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
ology to um get a pharmacy license and
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
um o she says in part oplc takes no
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
position on the bill however oplc
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
believes a statutory change may be
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
needed to clarify which licensing board
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
has authority to regulate the dispensing
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
of certain medications by healthc care
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
providers who choose to work with a
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacist in the circumstances under
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
which such medications may be dispensed
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to leave copies of
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
this for all of you okay thank you
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber so just so I'm that
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
was the same is that the same letter
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
that gave rise to this whole thing or is
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
this something completely new and does
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
it relate to the underlying Bill the
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment or
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
what so this is not the original letter
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
that gave rise to this that was a
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling that gave rise to
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
this um this was a letter I believe it's
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
dat April 25th it was the um a letter
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
that she um sent uh or had available um
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the underlying Bill okay so
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's specific to the underlying
 
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.470 align:start position:0%
it's it's specific to the underlying
Bill

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
correct and just as I listened to it was
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
she saying that there might be more
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
needed than just what was in the
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
underlying bill or was she saying that
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill I mean you really
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
um are you reading that as saying that
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill needed more work or
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
are you reading it as saying that the
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
underlying bill was what was clarifying
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to speak for
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
director Courtney but my understanding
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
is that the letter was in response
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
basically to the questions that have
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
Arisen that keep getting brought up that
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire oncology
 
00:42:54.109 --> 00:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
hematology is able to currently get a
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
license from the Board of Pharmacy which
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
we have maintained that we cannot
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
legally based on the rules um under pH
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
2300 and I think this was just her
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
saying yes we agree that a statutory
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
that statutory clarification may be
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
necessary in order for them to do this
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
and and one last followup and and that
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
was made clear with the declaratory
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
ruling is that not correct well we
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
believe so but we know that others do
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
not believe the same thing okay thank
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant you have a
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
comment more of a comment just history
 
00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:27.750 align:start position:0%
comment more of a comment just history
here

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
what happened was they went to the Board
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy under the so what triggered
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
this whole thing and came out of it was
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Board of Pharmacy and
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh executive
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
Courtney said the statute of the way
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's written is confusing to if we can
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
bring Clarity to the statute then she
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
felt more comfortable the board could do
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
what the uh practice is asking them to
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
do is issue the license but we didn't
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
have that Clarity at the time so it's
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what this bill's trying to
 
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.950 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what this bill's trying to
do

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Tanya
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
Carlton from The New Hampshire Society
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy you've asked for three
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
minutes yeah good morning representative
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
McDonald and members of the committee
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in support of
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
Representative Merchant's Amendment
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
which will allow for the Board of
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy uh to promulgate rules which
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
will um assist with ensuring safe um
 
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
medication dispensing as well as I think
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
it will also um alleviate representative
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
kushman's concern that she had brought
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
up earlier related to ensuring that um
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
it's not not just you know a provider
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
providing these medications but there is
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
oversight as well in terms of double
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
checks um when you do have a pharmacist
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
or Pharmacy involved um we are double
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
cheing for medication interactions to
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that these medic medications are
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
manner thank Youk you any
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
testify on this amendment does anyone

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
yes Amendment 1725 H online it's hard to
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%

two in support and six opposed I don't
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
know if that was the what the bill we
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
initially heard or this amendment okay
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Eric ala um
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I will bring
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
you a pink card as I sit back down for
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Erica Lon and I represent
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy um the there's a lot
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's going on in um cannabis and hemp
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
and what not this year um there's a
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
large move that may end up with full
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
legal with legalization of cannabis um
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
and or it may not actually succeed this
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
year uh last year um a bill to regulate
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
the hemp derived products was attached
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
to um another bill that we had had it
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
was part of the effort where there was
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
an agreement to have the study
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
commission over the summer and into the
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
fall to meet with the intention of
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
introducing legislation for the legal
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis um that
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
committee did not actually emerge with
 
00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and um for those in favor
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
fortunately somebody introduced it for
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
those in not in favor unfortunately
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
somebody introduced that legislation
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
however the um in the committee of
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
conference the prohibition on
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
intoxicating hemp ey products had a
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
Sunset date because there was an
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
agreement that there would be movement
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
there would be legalization before this
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
was extended this was done in order to
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that people were willing to
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
come together have a decision and figure
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
out how to finally get this done um
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
because of that simply coming along and
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of the Sunset date
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
without actually legalizing recreational
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
Cannabis um seems to violate that
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
agreement that we had in the committee
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
of conference what I've done within this
 
00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is that I have given a pathway
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
to have some regulations for the hemp
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
derived um THC products because we've
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
seen some pretty appalling packaging
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
from things that are being offered to
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
our um tobacco outlets they're being
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
told that some of these packagings that
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
look like sour patch kits and they s
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
Sour Diesel kids other things like that
 
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
that they're totally fine and they're
 
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
acceptable in the state it's deceptive
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
packaging they don't always have the
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
correct labeling we don't know what's in
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
them because the state has nothing to do
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
with the testing what this does is it
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
has a very Bare Bones mimic of what
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
would be set up and established within
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
legalization of cannabis itself to allow
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
testing for potency for um contaminants
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
like residual solvents poisons or toxins
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
harmful chemicals dangerous molder mildo
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
filth dangerous pesticides and
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
fungicides heavy metals and harmful
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
microbial such as ecoli and salmonella
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
and also the cannaboid and THC potency
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
um as well as the isomer so that you
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
know what you're getting so there are
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
two naturally occurring um that Delta 8
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 I'm actually not knowledgeable
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
enough to remember which one of is the
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
traditional cannabis we think of and
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
which is the one that's in hemp um but
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
those are the two that grow in nature um
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of other ones that I
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
like to call Franken weed that they
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
create in a lab that are all these other
 
00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.470 align:start position:0%
create in a lab that are all these other
I

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
those ones nobody really knows anything
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
about and the idea permitting those in
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
the state when they're just some lab
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
created derivative um just is a bridge
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
too far for me even though I generally
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
believe that people should be able to
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
make some make decisions on Lower risk
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
things that they consume so this
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is to instead of just having
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
an outright ban give a barebones
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure and uh for this
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
because generally the people who would
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
be selling it are
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
are the tobacco outlets having making
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the lenses need to comply with
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this section would
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
then address this um and would make it
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
so that if they're selling this
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
misleading packaging there's a
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
consequence for them and they don't want
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
to give up their licensing so that's
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
going to be a good way to make sure that
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
they are in fact staying within the
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines um ideally this also um
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully I hopefully this bill can just
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
stand on its own assuming that that the
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
other bill that it was supposed to be
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
paired with moves forward in the Senate
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
and actually moves towards adoption but
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately I would like to also see um
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis legalization that passed
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
out of the house attached to this on the
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
floor just to ensure that that attention
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
and in agreement during the committee of
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
conference that these other hemp derived
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
thc's um would have a Sunset date on the
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
prohibition in unless we were able to
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
get to legalization is truly carried out
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
so step one is making sure that we have
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
a framework for this regulation and that
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
is in this amendment too we can't get to
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
step two until we get to the house floor
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to take any
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber and then
 
00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:40.190 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber and then
representative

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you for this and thank you
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
explanation just because I'm loath to go
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
back and look in the chapter law and I
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
am reading the underlying bill which
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
of the prohibition is repealed so I've
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
got three negatives so am I correct in
 
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.630 align:start position:0%
got three negatives so am I correct in
thinking

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
that if we do nothing with the bill if
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
we pass the underlying Bill the
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
prohibition stays in place is that
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct or have I gotten that the wrong
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
way round um so I'm just going to give a
 
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
statement as opposed to answering that
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
what passed was a Prohibition that had a
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
Sunset date this fall what the bill
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill does is it reveals
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
repeals that Sunset date so the
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
prohibition would continue on into the
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
future into the sunset um so if we had
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
no action then it the repeal would stand
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
um if we passed the underlying bill then
 
00:52:46.109 --> 00:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
then it stays forever thank you very
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
much for that clarification that helps
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
me a lot thank you representative
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
Shapiro and then representative South
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
for indulging me because I haven't read
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
this carefully maybe it's it's in here
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
but um who would actually be responsible
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
for the testing and the um the expense
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
of testing well thank you for that
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
question the products would need to be
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
tested in order to be sold so because
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
the hemp derived products could be
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
manufactured out of state and then
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
brought in state because they don't V
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
violate any federal laws and therefore
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't have any Interstate restrictions
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
um if there is a Testing Lab out of
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
state that can meet those requirements
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
for labeling than the pro than the
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
person who is making this could do that
 
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
and have it tested out of state um
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that we do pass legalization
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
those testing Labs should also be able
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
to do what is necessary in order to test
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
these hemp derive products as well um so
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
assuming that these two go hand inand
 
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
that will the the further part will be
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
fleshed out within the language of the
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
underlying legalization Bill
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
1633 um and this would just piggyback on
 
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.390 align:start position:0%
1633 um and this would just piggyback on
it

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
follow so I see under categories of
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
um things to be tested um to um find
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
threshold amounts one of them is
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
filth um and is that a is that a
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
clinical term is there something that's
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
specific that is filth um thank you for
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
the question uh that's one of those
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
things that has survived and has been
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
included in the ongoing process towards
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
legalization of what the testing
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirements are I took that language
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
directly from the 1633 language um so
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
that's why it's included although quite
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm still not sure how you test
 
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
for Filth but you know what if a lab can
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
do it that's great and if not um it'll
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
probably end up being a test with a
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
threshold where it's essentially nothing
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
and then we can fix it in law or they
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
can just fix it through rule by making
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
it um a non- test if it's required and
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense thank you I didn't
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
think it was you that you came up with
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
it no representative Seth King and then
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
drafting this amendment I really didn't
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
like how the original was the language
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
it was unclean and this is so much more
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
explicit which I appreciate um one of
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
the things we heard in testimony on the
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
original bill which really struck a
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
chord with me is the idea that these
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
hemp products are getting people sick
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
and potentially as a result is really
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
giving cannabis a bad name and so people
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
will go to the hospital and then people
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
who don't really understand the issue
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
are going to be like oh that's cannabis
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
for you look at it look at all the
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
people that's making sick and it's like
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
no this isn't this isn't this isn't the
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
Cannabis we're all used to and have been
 
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
fighting for for decades this is
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
something totally different if if your
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment passes and gets signed into
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
law is that going to help do you believe
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
with the issues that we're seeing that
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
are inadvertently hurting the B merching
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
that the canis name uh thank you that's
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
a very good question so when you look at
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
the delta Delta 9 and I'm sorry I still
 
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
forget which one is which um but there's
 
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more knowledge of that one it's
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
these other isomers that they're
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
creating that seem that are the ones
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
where they're starting to see some
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
signals of a lot of harm um that's why
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
basically this bill keeps all of those
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
illegal but it simply allows for those
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
naturally growing ones to then be
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
distilled down because if you're going
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
to take something that's under under the
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
3% um that's yes under the 3% on a dry
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
weight basis there are ways that you can
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
um concentrate that down and you can do
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
that obviously it's a chemical process
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be as intensive as
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
if you're creating this other stuff in a
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
lab um and quite frankly I'm prob going
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
to see that most people are probably
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
going to move to uh prefer the natural
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
grown product over this um however I
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
think that it's also important to give
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
options so people aren't getting other
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
unregulated ones across uh state borders
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
either if they for some reason do like
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
um these types of products thank you
 
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.829 align:start position:0%
um these types of products thank you
representative

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:06.029 --> 00:57:06.039 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
this forward and I want to commend you
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
for trying to
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh find a solution to a product I think
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
does have some merits in the
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
marketplace a couple of questions I
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
have it goes back to it sounds like this
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
is creating more standards on production
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire if
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
they're buying these particular products
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
have some faith in what's going on with
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
what they're buying so that's the intent
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the standards is that where you're
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
trying to go um thank you for the
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
question so the intent of it is so that
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
there are guidelines that the
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have to meet so that when
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
a vendor has somebody say do you want to
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
buy this you know it's it's allowed
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
under state law there actually are some
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
Frameworks for what is allowed under
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
state law because most of these
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
retailers are calling and well there's
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
at least some that are calling and
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
asking when it's in state law those that
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
aren't calling and asking probably will
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
well soon because the Liquor Commission
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
is very good at following up with people
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
who are not following their rules follow
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
up follow
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
up and talking about the enforcement
 
00:58:11.309 --> 00:58:11.319 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
it given the fact many of these products
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
are obtained through the mail mail order
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh from locations outside of the
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of New Hampshire how would
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
that be handled uh thank you for the
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
question a lot of this is just focused
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
on the retail Market because since this
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
is not federally prohibited this has
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
sprung up as a new market it's one that
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
in the state we just said absolutely
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
none but there are some that are that
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
are still available in other places so
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
the biggest part is you walk in you see
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
something on the Shelf you ask if it's
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
legal they say it is um the question is
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
has it been tested so you know what's in
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
it and so that what the label says is
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
true you know people need to be able to
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
make a decision at a certain point but
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
if you have false labeling or if you
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
false claims then that should not be
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable and that should not be
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to be sold in the state um
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
without this framework you can't do that
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
so that's how this framework brings us
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the wild west that we were in and
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
moves us into a more regulated scheme um
 
00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:15.799 align:start position:0%
without Banning it outright thank you
 
00:59:15.799 --> 00:59:17.789 align:start position:0%
without Banning it outright thank you

morning you've asked for five minutes if
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
you could keep it closer to three I'd
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
um I've already spoken you at length on
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
these topics so I'll try to say new
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
things that are focused on the amendment
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
amendment so I've given you two handouts
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
that I've created one is problems with
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment the other is an attempt to
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
illustrate some contrasting
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
policies um how would Amendment 17398
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
treat these
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
products so I'll start with the biggest
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
problem we have here um the house is
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
already passed HB
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
1633 1633 would authorize The Liquor
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
Commission regulate the production and
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
sale of hemp derived intoxicating
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids notably hp1 1633 stipulates
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
that regulations for intoxicating hemp
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
products quote may not be less
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive than the regulations for
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
natural cannabis this amendment would
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
directly contradict and undermine that
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
policy uh by legalizing the sale of THC
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
pro products without effective
 
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
regulation it's one thing to use that
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
word regulation is another thing to have
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
an actual regulated system and
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this amendment doesn't and
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
can't create a regulated system for
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
these products which are all produced in
 
01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:37.549 align:start position:0%
these products which are all produced in
other

01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
states so just to illustrate on on the
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
side by side column A is the therapeutic
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis program laws and rules column B
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
is the house positions on adult use
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis regulation which are in
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
hb33 and the third column is the much
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
less restrictive and unenforceable
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
standards that would be created by this
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendment um so I won't go through all
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
of them but a few of the big ones
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
are lab testing for canabo and
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
contaminants yes absolutely I think we
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
can all agree that these products should
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
be lab tested there's simply no way for
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire regulator to require or
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
verify that they've been tested in
 
01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
verify that they've been tested in
another

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
state all of these products or at least
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
most of them I've seen include test
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
results a lot of them have QR code you
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
can look it up right there test results
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
what do those mean to me they mean
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing because these
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
products were not produced within a
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
regulated system I'll explain how our
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
system works with the TCP we have all of
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
our products every single batch tested
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
by an independent lab the lab reports
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
those results to the ATC and to the
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
and they're able to verify that every
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
label on every product that we have
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
includes the accurate batch specific lab
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
testing results for our products HP 1633
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
envisions a similar if not identical
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
type of system in New Hampshire we would
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
essentially be Outsourcing those
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
regulations to other states and
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately to companies themselves and
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
trusting them to
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
self-regulate um packaging so for both
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program and in
 
01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.549 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program and in
HB

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
1633 patch Packaging must be opaque and
 
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.589 align:start position:0%
1633 patch Packaging must be opaque and
child

01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
resistant uh that requirement does not
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
exist in this
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
amendment access to stores where
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
products and sold you can't get into an
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
ATC unless you are a registered patient
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
or caregiver you can't get into an adult
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail outlet established by
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
1633 unless you're 21 and older but any
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
person of any age can enter stores where
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
synthetic THC is
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
sold uh sales would be limited to 21
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
plus but there's no restriction in here
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.789 --> 01:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
displayed next we get into the
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
definitions and this is where I'll try
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
not to be confusing um but you've heard
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
that Delta 8 and Delta 9 are naturally
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
produced that's not really true so Delta
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
8 does occur in Trace Amounts in nature
 
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that 100% of the
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
derived Delta 8 product products that
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
are sold are synthesized because you
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
cannot grow enough delta8 to harvest it
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
you could start wrapping up
 
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.549 align:start position:0%
you could start wrapping up
please

01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay trying to be responsive to the
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that's been raised Del 9
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be questions anyway I'm sure
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
okay Delta 9 THC is the one the people
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
who've been using cannabis for years are
 
01:04:52.269 --> 01:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with the definition of hemp and
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's understand that cannabis and hemp
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
are the same plant the only difference
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
is this arbitrary definition it's in
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
federal law and state law that if it's
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
below 3% Delta 9 THC it's hemp if it's
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
above that amount it's THC or it's yeah
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's marijuana or or cannabis so
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment I mean the definitions
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
are are very
 
01:05:16.599 --> 01:05:19.309 align:start position:0%
are are very
problematic

01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
um if the intention is to only legalize
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
natural Delta hthc that doesn't exist
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
so um I assume the intention is to
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
legalize synthetic
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
THC Delta 9 THC that's made from hemp is
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
synthetic just as surely as Delta H THC
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
that's made from hemp is synthetic you
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
grow the CBD you soak it in acid you
 
01:05:42.119 --> 01:05:43.069 align:start position:0%
grow the CBD you soak it in acid you
make

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
THC that's how it's made so I would
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
argue that if these labels don't include
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
the word synthetic then they're falsely
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
and misleadingly
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
labeled um the biggest thing is we
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
simply can't impose regulations on other
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
states The Liquor Commission can look at
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
labels and say I think this counts or
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
this doesn't count but there's no way
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to know so this amendment
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
would create the illusion of
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
regulation in place of actual regulation
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude and answer questions any
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for your
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
testimony are you concerned that if the
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is passed or if underlying the
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
original bill is not passed that these
 
01:06:31.079 --> 01:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
original bill is not passed that these
so-called

01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
so-called
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
synthetic THC products are going to be a
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
threat to the passage of HB
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
1633 representative I don't see this
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill as having anything whatsoever to do
 
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.950 align:start position:0%
bill as having anything whatsoever to do
with

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
1633 this is about trying
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of a loophole and make
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
it permanent I know that's I don't think
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's the intention but I think that's
 
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
what would be the result it would
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
normalize and legitimize the sale of
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
products that are fundamentally more
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous and riskier than natural
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis normalizing their sale at gas
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
stations and convenience
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
stores while simultaneously we're trying
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
to create a responsibly regulated
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
cannabis market so Vermont has developed
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
a reputation for craft cannabis by
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
licensing hundreds of small Growers uh
 
01:07:24.109 --> 01:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
Maine has developed a similar reputation
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's reputation would be
 
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.829 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's reputation would be
synthetic

01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
synthetic
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
THC and I think that's a very poor very
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
poor example to set and a very poor
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
direction to go so I would encourage you
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
to view these as completely separate
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
they did wind up in the same bill that
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
created the study commission that's
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
because the house sent the original Bill
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
to interim study and the Senate kept
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
attaching this to other things they
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
ended up attaching it to the commission
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill so they wound up being lumped
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
together but they're entirely separate
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
issues I view this in the same way that
 
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
I viewed uh the synthetic marijuana
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
debates from 10 years
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
ago uh these products are people want
 
01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.589 align:start position:0%
ago uh these products are people want
natural

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
natural
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
THC if they grew it it would be a felony
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's legal in every
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
other New England State but it's a it'
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
be a crime here uh I would just urge you
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to make a stand for Freedom
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
fight for hom grow fight for access to
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
the plant don't fight for synthetic THC
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
and gas stations it undermines The
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
credibility of the hemp industry it
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
undermines The credibility of the
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry and it creates
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
confusion while I was here testifying on
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
this bill a few weeks ago one of my
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
former students from Kentucky sent me a
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
message and says hey I've been vaping
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
THC products I have a few questions for
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
you and turns out he had no idea they
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
were synthetic products that he was
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
buying in Kentucky one of them was
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
giving me a colossal colossal headache
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
why everybody lumps us together
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your uh your answer are
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
are you sure that
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
the the side effects the negative side
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
effects of the synthetics are not from
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
just the poor quality control the filth
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's in them as opposed to the uh as
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to the actual synthesized
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
THC I think the problem is not the THC
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
itself because Delta 8 THC I think is is
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
probably a safe canabo and if it's
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
produced Within actually regulated
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
market I think it's just fine I think
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
the issue is probably the the residual
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
solvents the acid not being properly
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
removed from the product and people
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
think these are natural products they
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
see strain names on them and think that
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
it's a strain of cannabis that's been
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
grown it is somebody bought a kilo of
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
THC oil that was produced by a CBD
 
01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
company they added turpins to it and it
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
is posing as as a cannabis product what
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
one last Quick followup one last
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
followup um but the amendment is my
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that its goal is to
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
regulate it so that it doesn't have
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
excess solvents and all these other
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
things in there I mean isn't that a good
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
thing it's a wonderful intention it is
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
simply impossible to do in practice
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
because no regulator in New Hampshire is
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
able to require or verify the lab
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
testing unless the state where it's
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
produced has a responsibly regulated
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
system I'm not aware of any state that
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
has a responsibly regulated system
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
people are doing whatever the hell they
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
want and they're calling it cannabis
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
very good thank you representative
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
to go back to the beginning I'm just s
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
trying to sort out again and I'm sure
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
you gave us this as your testimony
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
before but you are in favor of the
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
underlying bill unamended is that
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay and if uh and you're
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to this um do you have an
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
opinion as to the
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
advisability of trying to put this and
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
then put the cannabis bill that's
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
already in the Senate on it as
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
well and if you don't have an opinion
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
about that that's fine I just wanted to
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
know if you had one my opinion is that
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
we should abandon any illusion that New
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can effectively regulate the
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
production of products in other states
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what would have to
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
happen here so just since you asked
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
earlier the the the line that would be
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
repealed or not repealed just says
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
nothing in this chapter shall be
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
construed to authorize the sale of
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
products that are derived from hemp
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
which contain natural or synthetic
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
tetrah hydroc canaban greater than 0.3%
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
on a dry weight basis which appear in
 
01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
any formulation including Delta 8 Delta
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
9 or any other THC iser variant so I
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
view the original law and the law we're
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
trying to not repeal here as being basic
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
Common Sense clarifying the intent of
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature when it passed the hemp
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
law nobody thought they were legalizing
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
THC sales at gas stations I don't think
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
effective cannabis policy gets made by
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
exploiting loopholes I think it's made
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
by thoughtful
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
deliberation thank you very much
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy and then
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you thank you
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question hopefully you can
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
clear up some of my confusion because I
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
wrot down here last time you were here
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon you supported the bill correct
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
and your your statement was that THC
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
product should be
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
regulated and house bills 1633 basically
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
allows or allows THC but regulated
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
within the state for the sale within the
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
state right so you are all in favor of
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
that you're opposed to the
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
amendment because it attempts to
 
01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.070 align:start position:0%
amendment because it attempts to
regulate

01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
stuff filthy stuff that comes from out
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
of state is that
 
01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.830 align:start position:0%
of state is that
correct

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
correct so you would you you support
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
1633 you support because it's state
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
regulated you support you know regulated
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
THC and you support the ongoing
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition that would be present in the
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
current bill is that correct yes
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative and if it's helpful my
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
general positions on this issue are
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
pretty identical to the position papers
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
I've handed out from normal and doctors
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
for drug policy reform essentially THC
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
products should be regulated and
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
synthetic THC product should be
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
regulated at least as restrictively As
 
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.149 align:start position:0%
regulated at least as restrictively As
Natural

01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
Natural
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
THC so your incentive here really is to
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
make it so that the product that is
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately out there that regulated by
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
the state is a good product is a safe
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
product so that you know that cannabis
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
can then be sold within the state in a
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
controlled manner
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner okay yes I just want to
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
be clear about your position in but also
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
what you said previously thank you thank
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
you representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question I
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure I understand
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
two things first um the original bill is
 
01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
still in the amended version
 
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
correct in other words the prohibition
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the prohibition the prohibition
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
repeal thing the number one that's still
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
in there correct or is that totally
 
01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
gone because it says add a add this
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph after number one
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative we do you have a
 
01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.470 align:start position:0%
representative we do you have a
clarification

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
or subject to uh representative Lyon's
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
correction of my cor
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
clarification um there is in the
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
amendment the fact that uh
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
the because it says amend the bill by
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
after if you look at at section lines 19
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
to 21 representative Lon does have yeah
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to hear um thank you that
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
actually was a drafting error because
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
that would then repeal everything that
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
we would be creating there um it was
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
just a matter of hitting up against the
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
deadlines to get this into the calendar
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
so that is an error so okay because what
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
it says here is amend by after section
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
one so this implies section one which is
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
the repeal still exists but it doesn't
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
exist that was not my intent my intent
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
was instead of repealing to have the
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme oh okay all right so
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
will that be amended to change that then
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
all depends what we decide as a
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
committee okay so we're going to vote on
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
what here what's here right now is is is
 
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
section one from the original Bill still
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
exists is that correct um so we couldn't
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
really touch 439 d a because without an
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
non- derain amendment because we were
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
only at chapter law by opening up that
 
01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
section of the rsas we needed an on
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
Germain Amendment so to have any changes
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
within there we needed to open it up
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
through a non gerain hearing here all
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
right because that brings me to my
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
second question which is really more for
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
you and I think you may be answering my
 
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
question already
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
but I if one still existed it almost
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me like the second part's a no
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
harm no foul but without one it is a
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
harm and foul to you is that correct I'm
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
not sure and understand yeah I'm not
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
sure I understand either I think there's
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
two very Divergent paths here and I
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
don't see any future down the path of
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
trying to impose New Hampshire
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
regulations on these products so I I
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
just think this whole thing is a
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
non-starter and we need to default to
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
the original Bill and you're happy with
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
the original Bill the second Bill's
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
problem at part I got it absolutely now
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
I understand I think representative we
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
sorry but but just to pars what we have
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
in front of us which was what I was
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um lines um 19 to 21 prohibit anything
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fall under what's permitted
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
in here and and your position is so it
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
does have a
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
Prohibition um but your position is that
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
that would be very difficult to police
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the current situation is that correct
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
correct and I I should applaud that it
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
does limit to Delta 8 and Delta 9 it it
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
so this THC product would would be
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
illegal but this product that's 92%
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
synthetic Delta 9 Delta 8 THC which
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
isn't opaquely packaged isn't child
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
resistant uh says mindbending ghost
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
train Haze on it and makes you feel
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
Swifty which is a cartoon reference Rick
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
and Morty if anybody gets it uh this is
 
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
not a regulated product but my
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it would be legal
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
and presumably regulated under the
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
section assuming this QR code points to
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
an actual lab report of some
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
kind go ahead follow I'm not going to
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
get into the questions I have about the
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
display because it's just beyond what
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're really working on representative
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
Merchant then representative n thank you
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and also thank you for taking
 
01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and also thank you for taking
the

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
question in regards to the state law we
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
can prohibit what we do here in New
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but there's no prohibition for
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
mail order in other words a resident
 
01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
could be ordering it from anywhere else
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
in the country right so therefore if
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
they can do that why not try to create
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire that actually
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
tries to regulate the standards the
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines so the the patient or the
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
consumer has something to follow because
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
if we can't prohibit other states from
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
sending it into our residents then what
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
are we doing yeah thank you for the
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
question I agree we can't stop mail
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
order at all and there is no way with or
 
01:18:49.149 --> 01:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
without this am amendment that New
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could regulate mail order
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
delivery of these products the entire
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
point of the bill is to have these
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
products not be sold in gas stations
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
convenience stores in a less restriced
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment than exist would
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
exist for natural Canabis and I totally
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
concur I think what I'm trying to get to
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
is we can control the retail sale right
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so what this law is
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do is be sure that if we're
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
selling at the retail level at the gas
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
station wherever it's going to be sold
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
there's some control over some
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines of How It's manufactured it
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they can still ordered
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
on the mail so if we have at least some
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines for something being sold
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
retail here in New Hampshire aren't we
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
somehow making a step forward versus
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
telling people well just buy it on the
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
mail go to whatever www is ordered that
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
way there we have no jurisdiction over
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
it whatsoever representative I I think a
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
step forward would be passing hb1 1633 I
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't I don't view this as a step
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
forward in any way because again it
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
would be the illusion of Regulation it
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
would not be a reality of Regulation
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's never been a vote in the general
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
court that affirmatively said where we
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
want THC products sold at gas stations
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
and convenience stores I'm 100% certain
 
01:20:11.709 --> 01:20:11.719 align:start position:0%
that would have failed if it had been
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
understood to be what was in the hemp
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
Bill another followup so the illusion I
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
that I see is that we're sort of saying
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
to people in New Hampshire you can't buy
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
it retail but you can buy everywhere
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
else that's an illusion too because it's
 
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
not stopping people from getting it all
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do at that point in time
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
is trying to be sure in a state on anry
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have any retail sales of it am
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
I munding something here because
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
patients can still get
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
it anybody can still get it if they know
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
how to operate a website and order it
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
through the mail there's a very separate
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
question about these products being
 
01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
placed in stores where anybody can see
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
them while we're simultaneously trying
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
to create a much higher standard for
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
natural cannabis it just doesn't make
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
any sense to me
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative naal thank you Mr
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks again I I just want to
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
get Circle back so I want to make sure I
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
understand lines 19 through 21 and what
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
you've said so far if if we did pass
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment in some form or whatever
 
01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.030 --> 01:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
that um that's the synthetic one you're
 
01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
that um that's the synthetic one you're
talking

01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
about but in this case the Delta 9
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
that's derived from him would also be
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
synthetic okay so you would eliminate
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
both of them then in that in that
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
setting I would absolutely eliminate
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
this entire minut I go you all right
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Paz
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
off thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question so help me understand
 
01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
if it's being uh produced uh by
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate registered producer in
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
another state and sold in a legitimate
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
establishment here and we have
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
some grievances with headaches of us
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
like can they just
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
you uh uh people who sold them with uh
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
confusing labeling and maybe some
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
harmful residual acid inside like can't
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
we just use our current legal system if
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
people are
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
harmed representative I think that may
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
lead to a lot of lawsuits I think the
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
reality and we've learned this in the
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry is that like any other
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
business there are Bad actors in Vermont
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
I just saw a headline this morning where
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
a grower has been cited for the second
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
time using an illegal
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
fungicide it looks it appears that they
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
applied it after having the product lab
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
tested which I'll never understand uh
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
the effective regulatory system caught
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
it before anybody ingested it these
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
people will almost certainly lose their
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
license uh people products do fail tests
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
in regulated systems that actually
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
verify these things and unfortunately
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
have programs in other states don't do
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
that so there's no
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman Mr Simon
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you good to see I saw
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
him uh regularly for five years as we
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
developed this
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
program U my concern is the professional
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
medical committee that has been
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
established in New Hampshire that is
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
chaired by one of our former
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
members and at my age names slip by U
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
but this Jerry Jerry kerk right uh would
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
they have any role in uh reviewing these
 
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:53.719 align:start position:0%
products so the therapeutic canas
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board has discussed
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
this issue uh they determined that it
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
was outside the scope of the therapeutic
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis program so they decided not to
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
take a position on it I know that former
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
repres representative kerk strongly
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
supports effective regulation of all
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and and does not
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
support the cell I've discussed this
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
with him many times he does not think
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
synthetic THC should be sold in in gas
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
stations or convenience stores thank you
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for um taking this
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
question I I don't have a very
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
sophisticated understanding of these
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
products I haven't ever seen them in a
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
convenience store but I obviously I
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't looking carefully um but it seems
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
like there are two categories of
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
products one um which is described on
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
line 19 and one that's described on line
 
01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.430 align:start position:0%
line 19 and one that's described on line
28

01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
28
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
29 um
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and there there seems to me that they're
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
um I think we're talking about the same
 
01:25:05.629 --> 01:25:05.639 align:start position:0%
products in both both of those sections
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
we so they're the same products I
 
01:25:08.119 --> 01:25:09.109 align:start position:0%
we so they're the same products I
believe

01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
so one one talks about which appear in
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 Delta 9 on line
 
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.790 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 Delta 9 on line
30

01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
um oh and one talks about other than
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
that that yeah I'm sorry I misunderstood
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
and was reading it wrong I think 19 to
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
21 attempt to prohibit anything that's
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
not Delta 8 or Delta 9 which is
 
01:25:38.109 --> 01:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639 align:start position:0%
32 make an exception for those products
 
01:25:43.229 --> 01:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
right and would redefine I mean the
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
traditional understanding of s products
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
is that they're they don't contain THC
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
so we'd be completely changing the
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
definition of hemp and basically saying
 
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
that hemp is cannabis follow up so
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
anyway that was just a leadup to
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
question which is that um if we go with
 
01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
the original bill which which repeals
 
01:26:00.679 --> 01:26:01.510 align:start position:0%
the original bill which which repeals
the

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
repeal would would all these products
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
remain illegal in New Hampshire yes
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
they'd be clearly illegal under New
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and that maybe why you
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen them at convenience stores
 
01:26:14.109 --> 01:26:14.119 align:start position:0%
is because they are currently illegal
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
and this amendment seeks to undo so the
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
so the if we go with the the present
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
repeal all of them would fall under that
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
that um prohibition that's correct okay
 
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative South King
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you again for
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
um under
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
1633 um would people be able to have
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
access to THC vape
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
products yes okay so people do like to
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
use that method and and we'd be able to
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
get that with 1633 um and absolutely
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
either natural or synthetic
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay and the reason would you say that
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
the reason why people choose these
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
synthetic products is really just a
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
loophole it's to get around current
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on natural cannabis yes the
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
research I've seen suggests that these
 
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
products are much much much more popular
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
in States where people don't have access
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
to real cannabis uh so yeah I I don't
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
think they're very popular in New
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire frankly I might have more
 
01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:21.639 align:start position:0%
pause about this if we're talking about
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody living in Alabama where it's
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
300 miles nearest cannabis store but
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire have options
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
they can if they don't want to sign up
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
for the therapeutic program they can
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
drive to any neighboring state and there
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
is a real cannabis store right across
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
the border that would be a much better
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
choice than than any of this okay thank
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
you representative kosman did you have
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
you hand up earlier
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
or okay any other
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
questions see you onone thank you thank
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Jim Riddle
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.590 --> 01:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr chair members of
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jim Riddle from
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro I have a USDA hemp grower
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
license for seed production uh which I
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
obtained after the DEA a couple years
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
ago ruled that all cannabis seeds are
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
hemp uh because they contain no THC
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
there's zero THC in
 
01:28:27.639 --> 01:28:29.189 align:start position:0%
there's zero THC in
seeds

01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
seeds
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not involved in the THC
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
business one way or another either
 
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
natural or synthetic I only deal with
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
seeds I do serve on the board of uh
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board of the New Hampshire
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association and on the policy
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
Committee of Nova New Hampshire the
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
organic group but I'm speaking here on
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
my own behalf today and I have some
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about this amendment
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
1739 which would legalize the sale and
 
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
possession of synthetic intoxicating THC
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
products derived from
 
01:29:04.719 --> 01:29:07.189 align:start position:0%
products derived from
hemp

01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
hemp
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I've done a lot of work attended a
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
lot of meetings and really support uh uh
 
01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.910 align:start position:0%
lot of meetings and really support uh uh
hb1

01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
1633 but I am concerned that this
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendment would uh uh it's contradictory
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the language of 16
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
33 um 1633 would require that both
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
natural and synthetic THC products be
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
tightly regulated in terms of the
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
testing requirements in terms of how
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're labeled packaged marketed Etc
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's really a comprehensive approach to
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
both the direct cannabis as well as
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
these synthesized from hemp uh
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
intoxicating products but this amendment
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
would create an end run essentially um
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
jump starting giving favor uh to the
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
synthetic THC products while leaving
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
natural THC products either illegal as
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
they are now or in regulatory limbo uh
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
deter you know depending on the fate of
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
1633 uh and HB 1231 which is the medical
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
hom grow bill which I think are the two
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
priority pieces of legislation and 16 33
 
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
does have half a page about how
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
intoxicating hemp products will be
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
regulated um so this bill though or this
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
amendment ignores that and gives these
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
preferential treatments and they can
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
just jump start uh from out ofate
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
suppliers instead of building a craft
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis and hemp uh industry here in in
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
the state and i' just like to share a
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
few points from the doctors for drug
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
policy reform and their uh positions on
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
these uh synthetic uh hemp derived
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
products um they say the licensing
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for dispensaries selling
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
the in intoxicating cannaboid should be
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
required so these wouldn't be sold by
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
dispensaries these would be sold by any
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
gas station or tobacco shop that wants
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
to sell them there should be taxation to
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
fund regulatory oversight and public
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
health initiatives this Amendment
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't create any kind of funding for
 
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't create any kind of funding for
oversight

01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
mechanism um they should be in
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
childproof containers clear labeling uh
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
international symbol uh for cannaboid
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
content and that this that's ignored in
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
this you could start wrapping up please
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
you well I just like to also remind you
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
that this whole thing started because of
 
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
a loophole created in the 2018 Farm Bill
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh which legalized the production of
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
hemp and then uh um that is being
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
addressed it's a very hot topic as
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
Congress debates the new Farm Bill uh so
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think you need to be aware of that but
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
also how it interplays with the dea's
 
01:32:15.149 --> 01:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
proposed rule to change uh all cannabis
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh from schedule one to schedule three I
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
think that is going to uh and the one
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
thing that that has really brought to
 
01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
light is the
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
medical uses of cannabis it's not the
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
intoxicating properties the natural
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's the Entourage effects of
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
the tpen that are naturally found and
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
you can breed for higher tpen that have
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
more Health promoting properties these
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
products are purely intoxicating they're
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
just the THC uh that's been synthesized
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
from CBD turning it into THC whether
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's Delta 9 or Delta 8 or
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh concentrating it again please
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
please wrap up yes well just as a
 
01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
licensed hemp grower I'm uncomfortable
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
with those new definitions because hemp
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
is defined as not having anything over3
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
and now we'd have two just a state
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
unique definition of a regulated hemp
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think that goes too far and
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
certainly can undermine The credibility
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
of both cannabis and hemp okay thank you
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Kate fry
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
Futures good morning members of the
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
committee I'll be very brief um I just
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
want to uh first say I think this is a
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
well intended amendment I just think it
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
just doesn't get where we need to go I
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
think uh what I would like the committee
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
to do is consider the original bill
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
again that was something we were in
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
support of um I wanted to say that I
 
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
think we're getting confused by
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
conflating this with House Bill 1633 and
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
separate it but a representative pointed
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
out that I signed in on HB 1633 so I'm
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
even confused how these two relate to
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
one another so I understand the
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
committee's confusion
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to take you back to when
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
this original bill was introduced last
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
year as SP 180 and it was a Prohibition
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
on these products because we were
 
01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
finding that there were these um illegal
 
01:34:39.910 --> 01:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
products that were popping up
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
inconvenience stores gas stations what
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
have you many people and since those
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
retail stores are purchased by The
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission the Assumption was
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
that these were legal and okay so our
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
intent with that it was just to prohibit
 
01:34:55.229 --> 01:34:55.239 align:start position:0%
that it made it through the Senate it
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
made it through the house it passed um
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry it it was sent interim
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
study in the house Commerce Committee
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
and then it got attached to this other
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
Bill relating more to the study
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee of legalization so I really
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
just think we need to separate out um
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
the issues and right now we just have to
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
make sure this prohibition stays in
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
place so if we do nothing the
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition will end in October and what
 
01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
we want to do is pass the original bill
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that these products will be remain
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
prohibited until we figure out how they
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
can be regulated as part of our
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory process which other states
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
have done who've moved in that direction
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
but I just would think it's more helpful
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
to think of these as two very separate
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
issues um so I would again Ask the
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
committee to go back to the original
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
Bill and pass the original Bill and look
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
at some things in the amendment I also
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
understand from The Liquor Commission
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
who' be responsible for this that there
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
are several issues with it I think they
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
signed in aose but I don't know if
 
01:35:59.310 --> 01:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
they're um planning to speak but that
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
might be a helpful perspective as well
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
too thank you any
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murphy thank
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh I'll ask the same
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
question I asked Mr Simon your original
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
testimony when it was first presented
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
was in support of the bill you do not
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
support the amendment you support
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
1633 1633 is a separate issue for us
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
futes would at best neutral if our
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
principles um regarding responsible
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
commercialization is adopted but that's
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
a separate issue completely we're
 
01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to these very concerning we we
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
want these products off the shelves
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
immediately so but you didn't say to me
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
what was your opposition to the
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
amendment itself so I I do think it's
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
well intended but I just based on what
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon said I don't think it gets you
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
where it want you want to go with
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
regulating it yet and I also think my
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
understand as the Liquor Commission had
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about how this amendment was
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
written so it's regulation of it that
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
bothers you it's regulation I don't I
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily mind regulation down
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
alone I don't think this does that thank
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%

02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to call the executive
 
02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:16.559 align:start position:0%
session to order uh we have a p uh Pro
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
complimented bills to go through that
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get through this a
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
through the course of the day uh we'll
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
probably be breaking for lunch around
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
noon or shortly thereafter but we will
 
02:08:28.830 --> 02:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
get through as many as we can leading up
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
to that point uh beginning with Senate
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 400 um representative
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair
 
02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I'd like to um offer
 
02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
1830 and uh speak to the
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I'll second
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
that go go ahead representative mlan
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so I just um okay so during the uh
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
the the public hearing uh last week um
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
there was discussion about the fact that
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's this disparity if if the
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
patient is requesting the record or or
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
the patient's agent or or attorney is
 
02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:17.559 align:start position:0%
requesting the record and I think you
 
02:09:19.549 --> 02:09:19.559 align:start position:0%
know what basically came out of the
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing is that there really
 
02:09:25.229 --> 02:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
isn't any significant difference in the
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
workflow um whether the person who's
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
processing the record receives it from
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
the patient or from the patient's
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
attorney it's basically uh the same
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
workflow so on the surface of it it
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
would you know seem fair to just say hey
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
let's just make it
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
$66.50 for everybody since the workflows
 
02:09:47.069 --> 02:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
are essentially identical but the
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
problem is is that the the cost of of
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
going through and being able to get
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
those records is is not
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
$66.50 um and so if you basically make
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
it $6.50 across the board then the
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
third- party providers that are
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
basically doing the work they're just
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
going to I mean they're not in this for
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
charity they're just going to kind of
 
02:10:15.069 --> 02:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
walk away and they're going to say yeah
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
this this is not a business model that
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
we want to support anymore and um we're
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
obvious obviously because of Hippo
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do about the
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
$6.50 so what I tried to do in the
 
02:10:32.549 --> 02:10:32.559 align:start position:0%
amendment was kind of find my way uh to
 
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
some compromise you know speaking with
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
representative L she went through and
 
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
did some research looking at you know
 
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
how do they handle this in other states
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
and other states they have caps um for
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
the for the the patients attorneys that
 
02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
are above the
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
$6.50 U but obviously not you know up to
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
infinity and beyond and so for example
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
something like Alaska would would cap it
 
02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
about $75 and there were other uh states
 
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
that came in about1 but about $100 was
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much at the top end of of what I
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
was seeing so um I I went with a $100 in
 
02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment based on that and um
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
given the fact that there's extra
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
Logistics involved with the paper copies
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
I made it
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
$150 um for paper copies I was pulled
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
aside uh just before um uh we came in
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
and saying hey the way that you have
 
02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
written the amendment because you have
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
not changed the definition of requester
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
from when the original bill was written
 
02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
that basically means that even the
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
patient now is not capped at $6.50 that
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
the patient is capped at $100 so it was
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding I had looked at that um
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
when I had put it into ol it was my
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that Hippa trumped um and
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
so that basically that that $100 would
 
02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:04.559 align:start position:0%
only come into being um if those aspects
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
of HIPPA were rescinded um and that that
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
at least was my understanding um
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
obviously if that's not the case and we
 
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
can kind of discuss this we we'd have to
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
go back you know and do some follow-up
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
drafting on this um but that was my
 
02:12:19.709 --> 02:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
understanding and I know that there are
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
some attorneys on the committee that we
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
could maybe kind of flush out and had
 
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
that as part of the discussion but
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
anyways that's that's kind of the meat
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
and potatoes of uh the amendment that
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
I'm offering and thank you Mr
 
02:12:34.589 --> 02:12:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.229 --> 02:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Nagel thank
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I I'm I'm just to
 
02:12:42.270 --> 02:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I've said before as long
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
as the attorneys are in this bill I'm
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
not supporting it at all I W to support
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendment I will not support the bill I
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
think they're two totally separate
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
things having reviewed documents of up
 
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
to 2500 pages in length from attorneys
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
that have to be copied by um Physicians
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
offices takes a lot of time that's also
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
my understanding in the near future
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
hippo requirements are going to change
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
that you have to be incredibly cautious
 
02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
about going through the record and
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
deciding what you will and will not send
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
which means that it's not just hurling a
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
chart and pushing a button it's going to
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
be dramatically more complicated so um I
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
I think if you if you eliminate them I'd
 
02:13:19.149 --> 02:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
support it if you leave them in I'm not
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
mlan for bringing the amendment um
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
looking at this and looking at the
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
understanding I thought that there was
 
02:13:33.669 --> 02:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
an idea that um the committee probably
 
02:13:35.229 --> 02:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
had some number that they wanted to
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
increase it to and so doing that work
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
and looking at what the cap would be on
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
a non-patient request um was why I was
 
02:13:43.709 --> 02:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
providing the information and trying to
 
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
get to a number um frankly it there's
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things that bother me
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
about the medical records it's my record
 
02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:52.599 align:start position:0%
and I think anybody should want my
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
record that I give permission to to get
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
my record should get it and I think the
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
fact that anybody's going through and
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
doing anything to my record before
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
releasing it to me I find absolutely
 
02:14:04.549 --> 02:14:04.559 align:start position:0%
atrocious so the idea that there needs
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
to be work other than referencing it and
 
02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
then doing the output to it um I I think
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand how there's an
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
expensive workflow because it's my my
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
record and I should have it um you know
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
further depending on how much time we
 
02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
have if we decide not to exact this one
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
right away um there there's some talking
 
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
about how a medical patients medical
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
records are stored and available in an
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
electronic format they should be
 
02:14:30.549 --> 02:14:30.559 align:start position:0%
provided in that format to the requester
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
um but if we if we don't end up
 
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
executing that one today I'll bring an
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
amendment or maybe just might even do it
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
on the floor if we do exec it so that it
 
02:14:40.109 --> 02:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
provided in that format without being
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
turned into paper or into another less
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
usable format before because I've tried
 
02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with documents where somebody
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
prints it scans it in an unfriendly way
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
and then gives me an electronic where
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
the utility has been massive massively
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
degraded um I know that there's some
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
concern about this being a fishing
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
Expedition but you know when you look at
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
it and when you're hiring an attorney
 
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be doing all of
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
this stuff um without you know you have
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
the argument about you know being able
 
02:15:08.189 --> 02:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
to go and have it be cheap to get the
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
information and have ai do it but at
 
02:15:11.549 --> 02:15:11.559 align:start position:0%
that point too they could just have an
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
individual provide that record um to me
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
to me really the only thing to enforce
 
02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not doctors are following
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines doing what they
 
02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
should do is having that check on it and
 
02:15:25.870 --> 02:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
um to me I just think we should have
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
access to our record so I appreciate
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
bringing the amendment hopefully
 
02:15:30.669 --> 02:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll be able to figure out
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
where we are on this um but if we're not
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
able to amend it I'm going to support
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
the underlying but I think I'll probably
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
support depending on where we are thank
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
you other discussion representative
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you and also pres mlan
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing forth the
 
02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it goes in the right
 
02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.790 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it goes in the right
direction

02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:15:55.549 --> 02:15:55.559 align:start position:0%
I have a concern because if you're a
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
trial lawyer or malpractice attorney you
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
take it on the case and make money on it
 
02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
so I want to be sure we don't have an
 
02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
indirect way that we're subsidizing that
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
business model by making it less costly
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
for them to obtain records in order to
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
make the business model more profitable
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't know where that fine line is
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
in there um but that's my concern is
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
that whether it's $100 $150 when you
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
think about about some of these
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements they're in the
 
02:16:25.629 --> 02:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
million sometimes so therefore if we're
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
trying to allow the attorneys the
 
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a lot of records at
 
02:16:33.629 --> 02:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
no cost or minimal cost are we doing two
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
things one are we going to increase the
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of malpractice because it's
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
easy to get the records a little cost to
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
them and at that point in time if they
 
02:16:43.389 --> 02:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
have these large settlements why are we
 
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
taking the money from the from somebody
 
02:16:47.629 --> 02:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
else to shift it over to somebody who's
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
making a money off from it so that's
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
kind of where I'm coming from I do want
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
to say what you did today is going that
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
direction but I don't know if this is
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
the answer to
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
it other discussion representative South
 
02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair um I also will
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
not be supporting the amendment or the
 
02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill uh to me this looks like
 
02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
price fixing um uh we're putting a cap
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
on what an industry can charge um I
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
think even just labor costs costs more
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
than what would be allowed I mean
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
nothing is $6 or $100 anymore people
 
02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
make that in an hour so if you do even
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of Labor you're you're
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
already exceeding that never mind all
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
the the money that goes into storing and
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
that whole process and I also think
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
we're leg regulating what we don't
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
really understand um it was clear from
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
the public hearing day that there were a
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
lot of questions on how this like
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
industry even works and a lot of us were
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
confused by it and so the idea of like
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
regulating something we don't understand
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with and then last um
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're pushing the cost to those who do
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
not request their information so you
 
02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
know you have millions of patients and a
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
subset of them are going to request
 
02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
their information and if we don't uh if
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
if we don't charge them then the money
 
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
that the industry has to pay to give
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
them is going to be borne by everybody
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
else in their medical bills so I don't
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
like the idea of socializing the cost
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
I'd rather it be like look if you want
 
02:18:13.389 --> 02:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
your if you want your records you have
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
to pay the cost and um there's also that
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
attorney thing that kind of is weird to
 
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
me as well so I I understand why they're
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
an issue and there's problems but I
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
solution representative um
 
02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman I it would
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
be hypocritical for me to not say the
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
following but rep representative Le I
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
agree with everything you said about
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
this being the patients chart and I and
 
02:18:39.950 --> 02:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think that it should be available to
 
02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:41.030 align:start position:0%
I think that it should be available to
patients

02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
unredacted um at a low cost um but I but
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
I I come to an end when it comes to
 
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys requesting it for their issues
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
I will also say sorry that a lot of
 
02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:55.240 align:start position:0%
times we get attorney requests for
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
disability um like um Social Security
 
02:18:59.709 --> 02:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
Disability VC rehab things like that
 
02:19:01.629 --> 02:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
where they're not making any money off
 
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
of that so it's almost like we have a
 
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
lot of different circumstances we're
 
02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with here it's not the only
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
one represent robt did you have your
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
hand up a moment ago I'm sorry no
 
02:19:15.190 --> 02:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
problem um I'm still sort of trying to
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
formulate my thoughts on this bill
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
contradictions in my mind uh I
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that the patients
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're the patients records and the
 
02:19:26.669 --> 02:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
patient ought to do what they want to do
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
with their records I'm kind of horrified
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
to find that there are aggregator I I
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say aggregators but they're
 
02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're folks working under
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
contract to do the record review before
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
they're sent out uh because that was
 
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
just a New Concept to me although a
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
medical um organization should have the
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
right to contract with whoever they feel
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
does the best job of dealing with
 
02:19:55.309 --> 02:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
whatever they're dealing with I get
 
02:19:55.319 --> 02:19:56.830 align:start position:0%
whatever they're dealing with I get
that

02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:59.790 --> 02:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm still struggling with the
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
question that wasn't adequately answered
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think at the initial hearing
 
02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
which is why doesn't the patient just
 
02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
get the record and then hand it to the
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
attorney I get it that the attorney
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
needs the records to evaluate whether
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
they want to take the case or not
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
because although some cases are worth
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars not every case is
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
and you need if you're working on a
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
contingency basis you need to make an
 
02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate evaluation about whether
 
02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
this case is one you want to take or not
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
so there there's a need to be able to
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
get things at less
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
cost I'm not a medical malpractice trial
 
02:20:43.950 --> 02:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
attorney so there are a lot of questions
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that I have that I don't have answers to
 
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
so anybody who's making reference to the
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the room I got nothing for
 
02:20:55.230 --> 02:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
you because my specialty was elder law
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
um and a few
 
02:20:57.240 --> 02:20:59.790 align:start position:0%
um and a few
divorces

02:20:59.790 --> 02:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
divorces
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
um so there are a lot of equities
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
involved in this bill in all kinds of
 
02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:06.110 align:start position:0%
involved in this bill in all kinds of
different

02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
directions um I fervently wish that the
 
02:21:11.230 --> 02:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
bill had been sent to
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary because the issues in the bill
 
02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
are not really health issues except for
 
02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
the protection of privacy which is
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
something that is just as much a concern
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary Committee as it is of
 
02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:28.469 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary Committee as it is of
us

02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
um one part of my brain is saying
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
because there are all of these questions
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
interim study might be a viable
 
02:21:42.429 --> 02:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
alternative I'm not entirely persuaded
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
that interim study in this committee is
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
going to clarify much uh which is a
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
long- winded way of saying having
 
02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
listened to everybody and agreed with
 
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
practically everything that everybody
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
said I am completely in a quandry about
 
02:21:59.070 --> 02:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do about the
 
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill so I hope I hope that was really
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
helpful to everybody representative mlan
 
02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so thank you Mr chair I mean I I
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
would be more than willing to to go back
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
and and kind of revisit maybe clarify
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know the federal versus State thing
 
02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate the limits but I I guess I'm
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
just kind of looking to get a a straw
 
02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
poll if you could Mr chair to kind of
 
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
figure out where we are is that worth
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
doing uh is it worth interim studying um
 
02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question I would ask to
 
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
the committee is does this amendment
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
have any support and should it be looked
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
at further or or no so who would support
 
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
it I guess who's in favor of the
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
amendment sure representative Weber the
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
only other comment I would have based
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
solely on the construction on the
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
content in this amendment is that um the
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
argument was made to me and I think it's
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
probably a good one that if you're given
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
what was sent to us by the Senate if if
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do is hit 150 as a
 
02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
sweet spot you probably ought to write
 
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment as more but I certainly
 
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
obviously can't speak for what the
 
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
Senate will do about anything that we
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
send them so but but I I I appreciate
 
02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:24.990 align:start position:0%
send them so but but I I I appreciate
the

02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
effort point of clarification to
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative McLean are you asking for
 
02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
a St poll about the amendment or talking
 
02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
about an option to El interim study um
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
right now I'm I'm yeah right now I'm
 
02:23:40.349 --> 02:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
just looking you know on the amendment
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
if we say like it no I don't think that
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment even there's enough here
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
to even work on at this point so I can't
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
support it the interim study I think
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
would be separate discussion I just want
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
to know you know is there enough support
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
behind this amendment in any form or or
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
not and so then if that's the case I
 
02:24:01.830 --> 02:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
would just withdraw the amendment so
 
02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we could move on to another
 
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
discussion around value of interim study
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
or things of that nature so I guess
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I was looking for
 
02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:10.630 align:start position:0%
that's what I was looking for
representative

02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant representative Lon um thank you
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I just looking at this
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
my my question would be if there would
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
be if we knew who wasn't going to vote
 
02:24:23.070 --> 02:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
for any version vote positively either
 
02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
an not to pass or an not to pass pass as
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
amended if we knew who was going to be
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
either an interim study or an itl that
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
would guide us as to whether we're going
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
to work on an on an amendment we don't
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
need to clarify the difference between
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
interim study and itl at this point if
 
02:24:38.429 --> 02:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable straw poll well I
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
think you do
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
because I mean there just way too many
 
02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
options so respectfully my my point is
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not we work on continuing to
 
02:24:49.469 --> 02:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
amend the bill or if we get into motions
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
on in on on something other than an
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
amended or the underlying bill so if we
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
know that we don't have enough people
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
that would pass the bill or pass the
 
02:24:59.710 --> 02:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
bill with any amendment that would be
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
gerain to this then we know that then
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're into a discussion of interim study
 
02:25:06.910 --> 02:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
or itl okay said that way I I F now
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
following you okay so who would be
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
amendment just support some sort of
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
Passage um either this amendment or
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
pass is anybody accounting by the way no
 
02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:29.510 align:start position:0%
pass is anybody accounting by the way no
okay

02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
handsor you come um and we have more
 
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
than half of us that would be willing to
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
pass some form of this bill well
 
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
potentially is that oh is that I I guess
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
the question wasn't exactly clear um who
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
would be would be able to did you mind
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
if I phrase it um thank you who um sees
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
some way of getting either to ought to
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
pass or to pass is amended um on this
 
02:25:55.309 --> 02:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
bill including including raising the cap
 
02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
yes including raising the cap but some
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
way of getting to either a to pass or
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 
02:26:06.349 --> 02:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
9 10 11 12 13 14 okay so now we just
 
02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
need to figure out how those 14 go um I
 
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
guess should we start an auction process
 
02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
who's over $100 for the for the
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys or people or I guess
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
maybe representative or
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
I think for speaking only for myself um
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
I think the number in an amendment that
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
I would support should be higher not
 
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
lower representative
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman um I I
 
02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
would vote for itl for both the bill and
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and the reason I say
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is that if you kept the bill I
 
02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
would eliminate on Section a line 8
 
02:26:53.309 --> 02:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
everything after the patient um the
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
patient's personal representative the
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
attorney etc etc um as far as I'm
 
02:26:58.910 --> 02:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
concerned I agree with with
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Leon the the record is
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the patients right to have in any shape
 
02:27:06.190 --> 02:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
or form they get it whether it's paper
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's electronic however they get
 
02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
it it's their record when they go to a
 
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
physician for referral you want the
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
least amount of paper is possible
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
because the referring physician does not
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
want to read a whole lot of stuff so I
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the Bill entirely
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
because I think the patient gets the
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
patient record for free and they should
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh and anybody after that if they want
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
to re request a copy of the um the
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
record for whatever reason if they get
 
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
the consent of the patient which is done
 
02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
now it's done at whatever the cost of
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
the going cost is you now I don't have
 
02:27:40.349 --> 02:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
that right in my head but it should be
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
at a cost to the um the people that
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
requested but in in my mind the bill
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
goes nowhere and I don't care what
 
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
number you put on it what what you do it
 
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
Chang it what amend me you put forward
 
02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
to my mind you know the patient's record
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
is the patient's property the patient
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
should have the right to it for free of
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
charge anybody else after that can get
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
the copy as at the consent of the
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
patient but they would pay the going
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
rate whatever that might be for the
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
institution to provide for the
 
02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
information at no cost at I I shouldn't
 
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
say at a profit they should get the
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
record but not at a profit so you know
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned that's why I
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
would itl this bill you Amendment
 
02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.230 align:start position:0%
would itl this bill you Amendment
representative

02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:25.389 --> 02:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
Nel um if we were going to go that
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
direction of amending the bill I would
 
02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:28.670 align:start position:0%
direction of amending the bill I would
feel

02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
feel
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
strongly that we not have a cap but have
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale which I know
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically increases the complexity of
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill which might make an interim
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
study make a lot more sense but I will
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
tell you you know I deal with a lot of
 
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
people with complex disabilities and
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
seeing a 2500 page chart to review is
 
02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
not that unusual and that's a lot
 
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
different than copying 50 or 100 pages
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
so um I I think that if we're going to
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
go that way a simple Cap's not good
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
enough for
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
me representative uh kushman thank you
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I um for all of the reasons
 
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
stated I will not support this bill um
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
pretty much in any form that I can
 
02:29:11.230 --> 02:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
conceive it being brought forth now I
 
02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
think I think um Dr NE representative
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
nle you had a very good point with the
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
FL sliding scale because playing you
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
know throwing out numbers and saying
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
well how about this how about that
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's very arbitrary and nothing
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
government does should ever be arbitrary
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
um so it sounds like this really needs
 
02:29:30.150 --> 02:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
more study and um you know I agree some
 
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
patients are so medically complex and
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
have such a long history we're talking
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know tens of thousands of pages
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
potentially um from from especially if
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's one hospital system where they've
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
had all their care um so for all those
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
reasons I won't be supporting know at
 
02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
least one of us has to leave at noon or
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
there abouts um so if you have a couple
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
of quick comments representative
 
02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
merchant do you have something quick I I
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
basically my comment is that I would be
 
02:29:59.150 --> 02:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
willing to support inum study I think
 
02:30:01.309 --> 02:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
there's some merits here but as it's
 
02:30:02.830 --> 02:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
written today and not getting all the
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together and trying to find
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
a path forward is premature
 
02:30:07.279 --> 02:30:08.830 align:start position:0%
a path forward is premature
representative

02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering if um representative
 
02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
Nagel could elaborate on what the
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
sliding scale would be based on um is it
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
the kind of case quick answer
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
but request for next week in exec we can
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
should we put in a schedule unbelievably
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
quick answer I would defer that to
 
02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
people that know period I don't know I
 
02:30:36.910 --> 02:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
don't maybe we maybe uh should we recess
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
and then come back at one and continue
 
02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
this discussion would that be
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate why don't we do that okay
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we recess uh and
 
02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
come back at one go to lunch and any
 
02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
meetings we may have and we'll continue
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%

03:39:35.870 --> 03:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to reconvene the executive
 
03:39:39.070 --> 03:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
session and we were talking about sp400
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
before we broke at noon and there's been
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
more discussion since then
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative mlan uh you and I with
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
speaking earlier and you got any
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts yeah so uh thank you Mr chair
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
so I
 
03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
mean I brought forth the amendment I I
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
thought it was an attempt to to strike a
 
03:39:58.670 --> 03:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
fair balance but you know I'm obviously
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
reading the te leaves and I I don't
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
think it it's going to have the the
 
03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
Firepower to kind of go through today so
 
03:40:07.389 --> 03:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um I think there was some
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about inim study I'm going to
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
withdraw uh the motion if you withdraw
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
your second and then we can go on to
 
03:40:18.429 --> 03:40:18.439 align:start position:0%
some subsequent discussion okay I I'll
 
03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
withraw my a second
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
also um and again I've heard um I've
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
heard discussion of inim study U so I
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
for that matter I I guess I can make
 
03:40:32.229 --> 03:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
that motion I'll move inim study do I
 
03:40:33.590 --> 03:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
second uh and again um not to belabor it
 
03:40:40.110 --> 03:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
but obviously there's a lot of concerns
 
03:40:43.070 --> 03:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
about this bill it's it's it's
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
complicated for a whole bunch of
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
different reasons and this would be the
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
most at this point in time this would be
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate course of action um
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts or any other comments
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
I I share the thoughts with the chairman
 
03:40:58.830 --> 03:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time it's a complex
 
03:41:00.670 --> 03:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
issue that I think needs to get resolved
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
but right now try to do it with our

okaya

03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
okaya
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
Merchant so in the draft of the first
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
time I made the amendment there was a
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
mistake because I was working off the
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
wrong version of the Senate bill that
 
03:45:24.429 --> 03:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
was passed so I made the correction if
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
14 it just basically says that point
 
03:45:32.670 --> 03:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
time vaccines licensed by the United
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
States Food and Drug Administration and
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
also recommended by the United States
 
03:45:39.030 --> 03:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
Center for Disease Control and
 
03:45:41.030 --> 03:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
prevention advisory committee on
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
immunization practices or the successor
 
03:45:45.389 --> 03:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
organization that was what it should
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
have said but unfortunately the first
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
time I did it was the wrong version of
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate so I wanted to make the
 
03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
correction I want to say thank you to tr
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
L for catching the A and then number two
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things I did hear from the
 
03:46:00.429 --> 03:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
pharmacy Community was that on line 17
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be sure that it only
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
applies to those who administer the
 
03:46:06.750 --> 03:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine um not to other technicians and
 
03:46:09.309 --> 03:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
so forth that it it sort of implied but
 
03:46:11.149 --> 03:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
they wanted to have it explicit which
 
03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
made sense to me and then also on lines
 
03:46:16.670 --> 03:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
30 on the back side they had to re
 
03:46:16.680 --> 03:46:18.229 align:start position:0%
30 on the back side they had to re
things

03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:46:20.910 --> 03:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
because by putting in the audition of
 
03:46:23.429 --> 03:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
the um who ministers the vacines we had
 
03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
to go through the process through make
 
03:46:27.630 --> 03:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
it into instead of one two and three the
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney said it has to become
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
a b c and d why I don't know but that's
 
03:46:33.870 --> 03:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
what they instructed me to do so it
 
03:46:36.030 --> 03:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
basically takes the one turns it to a
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
forth so it's more of a nomeclature
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
or drafting process everything else
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same okay thank you any
 
03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:52.870 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same okay thank you any
other

03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing any representative
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative nle did you have your
 
03:46:58.990 --> 03:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
hand up I guess so I'm just curious why
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
do they need to have a minimum of
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
professional liability insurance now
 
03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's in current law oh it is
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.070 --> 03:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
discussion see actually no so we can be
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
quicker I don't need to okay seeing no
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
other discussion I'll ask the cl to call
 
03:47:19.710 --> 03:47:19.720 align:start position:0%

03:48:53.950 --> 03:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lon um thank
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant for bringing the
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify that and pull out
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
the different statutes um I I appreciate
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
me making it a lot clearer um I'm still
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
I it still bothers me to delegate the
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
selection of vaccines to other bodies on
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
doing this to that um CDC and asip and
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
so because of that I can't support the
 
03:49:16.189 --> 03:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
the bill but I greatly appreciate you
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
making it so that we have stronger
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
language because most likely this
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
probably will be what becomes law so I
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Improvement however I
 
03:49:24.670 --> 03:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that we should delegate our
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
job so thank
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
discussion oh representative
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
Plaza thank you Mr chair I also cannot
 
03:49:38.349 --> 03:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
support the the bill as amended uh
 
03:49:40.830 --> 03:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
because it's relinquishing
 
03:49:43.229 --> 03:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of New Hampshire
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
general court and gives it uh to uh
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
Federal bodies like CDC and FDA and uh
 
03:49:56.429 --> 03:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
definitely I'm not happy how they um
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing current vaccination and responded
 
03:50:01.269 --> 03:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
to pandemic and you know who else
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
unhappy with how they did it they
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
themselves uh unhappier so we are saying
 
03:50:11.790 --> 03:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
that in this body we don't have uh
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
enough experience but CDC director
 
03:50:17.950 --> 03:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
valinski said herself that there was
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
lack of stuff with adequate clinical
 
03:50:23.830 --> 03:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
experience in CDC and that there were
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
some major problem flip
 
03:50:29.550 --> 03:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
flopping uh uh they used testing
 
03:50:33.149 --> 03:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
initially with that were faulty up to
 
03:50:37.630 --> 03:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
33% error rate the the they were not
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
testing a sympatic people that they were
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
craning or detaining in cruise ships uh
 
03:50:46.990 --> 03:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
so they was One Missed opportunity after
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
another and what's going on now did they
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
get better
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
so uh when we heard about
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
vaccination uh this covid vaccine uh uh
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
Dr Benjamin Chen recognized that uh
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
there are some cases of my carditis in
 
03:51:12.269 --> 03:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
young males but how did vaccine get to
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
the heart it should stay in the muscle
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
tissue and for decades there were
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
protocols to for vaccines to stay in the
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
muscle tissue people were using
 
03:51:29.149 --> 03:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
aspiration so to test that needle is not
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
in a blood vessel uh people were using
 
03:51:32.960 --> 03:51:34.189 align:start position:0%
in a blood vessel uh people were using
slow

03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
slow
 
03:51:36.830 --> 03:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
injection to make sure that we don't
 
03:51:40.630 --> 03:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
Rapture baby tissue and babies don't
 
03:51:43.229 --> 03:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
experience mRNA in their hearts that are
 
03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
making holes so what CDC recommends
 
03:51:50.269 --> 03:51:50.279 align:start position:0%
currently if you go to and Google CDC
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
the pink book it's uh vaccine
 
03:51:55.910 --> 03:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
preventable recommendations the have
 
03:51:59.110 --> 03:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
chapter that say says inject vaccines
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
rapidly without expiration so those very
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
practices that for decades were used for
 
03:52:07.550 --> 03:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
safe vaccine
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
Administration Federal bodies like CDC
 
03:52:14.590 --> 03:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
tells us don't do it do it the other way
 
03:52:17.550 --> 03:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm very uncomfortable with
 
03:52:17.560 --> 03:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
so I'm very uncomfortable with
us

03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh moving our duties to CDC when when
 
03:52:28.189 --> 03:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
CDC itself recognizes that there are
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
many missed opportunities and Mis
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you thank you other
 
03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Merchant thank
 
03:52:41.110 --> 03:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I also want to say uh to
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative poo I do understand what
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying although this doesn't
 
03:52:46.349 --> 03:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
speak to the merits of the vaccine talks
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
about who actually administer the
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine um and then number two if I
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
could repr Lon um right
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
now almost all the other Healthcare
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
Providers can get the vaccine and we're
 
03:53:00.070 --> 03:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
basically saying with PR say can't so if
 
03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
I go to NSE practitioner I can if I go
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
to an MD I can if I go to a PA I can I
 
03:53:06.030 --> 03:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
mean I go on and on and on about all the
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
places the patients can go to me this is
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
a patient access issue it's allowing the
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
patient that get to the vaccines that
 
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
they would normally get someplace else
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
to help them with access to minimize the
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
barriers right now we know on primary
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
care it's a challenge to get in make an
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
office visit so if you want to get a
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine at that point in time this
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
provides greater opportunity greater
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
access for the patients so it doesn't
 
03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
speak to the merits of the vaccine it
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
speaks to the access to the
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
patient representative Lon um thank you
 
03:53:37.229 --> 03:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for that
 
03:53:39.149 --> 03:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant um I think we've
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
discussed before about how pharmacists
 
03:53:43.149 --> 03:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
really could do a lot more than we
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
currently allow them under law I would
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
rather give them all of those Powers
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
together as opposed to picking out
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
different ones because the only way we
 
03:53:52.590 --> 03:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
can get to practicing to the scope of
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
practice is by getting some of this
 
03:53:56.189 --> 03:53:56.199 align:start position:0%
group's fa favorites here and some of
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
this group's favorites there so that we
 
03:54:00.590 --> 03:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
can move on to a better
 
03:54:03.790 --> 03:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
solution I concur with repon I would say
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
this right
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
now that's a longterm goal but right now
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
we have to sometimes take baby steps to
 
03:54:12.429 --> 03:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
get there and at this point in time I
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
think it's a safe baby step for them to
 
03:54:14.159 --> 03:54:15.030 align:start position:0%
think it's a safe baby step for them to
take

03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
this is not a mandate this is only an
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity this is a question about
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
patient access and I would love to work
 
03:54:23.429 --> 03:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
with you on a bill to try to comp to try
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
to expand and make the access and use of
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacist broader to hopefully tax some
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare issues we have
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
today other
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the

motion representative L uh yes thank you
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman um this addresses
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
an issue that is very important and has
 
03:56:25.630 --> 03:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
hit many people in my in my town
 
03:56:27.590 --> 03:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
including a mom who came and spoke with
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
us um this is a committee looking to see
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
what how we can make sure that we can
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide access to everybody and I think
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense to move forward see
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
what that committee comes up with and
 
03:56:41.070 --> 03:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
then address those results after that
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
committee does its work good

of it it's it's an important issue it's
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
it's one that I think we really ought to
 
03:56:57.910 --> 03:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
work on okay thank you other discussion
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative plazo uh thank you Mr
 
03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
chair I will be voting against it I
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
agree that it's an important uh issue uh
 
03:57:09.630 --> 03:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
establishing yet another committee and
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh from testimonies uh it feels like
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh people already pushing to one certain
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
um decision and uh it's like U uh I feel
 
03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
like it's already covered only now if
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
State wants those services are uh
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
delivered state state pays for them but
 
03:57:41.830 --> 03:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
now uh the solution offer is to
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
push um price
 
03:57:48.510 --> 03:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
um Insurance Company to pay for it so
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's like unfunded mandate in my view uh
 
03:57:59.830 --> 03:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
so so uh I just uh think that the way it
 
03:58:03.910 --> 03:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
is might be more fair than than what uh
 
03:58:07.149 --> 03:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
we are trying to achieve with this
 
03:58:10.349 --> 03:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you other disc representative
 
03:58:13.950 --> 03:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
Missour yeah thank you um I am going to
 
03:58:15.790 --> 03:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
be voting against this as well not
 
03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
because I'm against studying Mental
 
03:58:20.469 --> 03:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
Health Services because of what I heard
 
03:58:24.429 --> 03:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
in the hearings um that um the New
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire instit Insurance Institute
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
said a work group was already formed to
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
address like the billing codes issue um
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
and so it sounds like they have a they
 
03:58:36.990 --> 03:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
have a group form to address all the
 
03:58:39.349 --> 03:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that came about as a result of
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and also it sounds like
 
03:58:43.630 --> 03:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
there's a be Behavioral Health crisis
 
03:58:43.640 --> 03:58:44.710 align:start position:0%
there's a be Behavioral Health crisis
committee

03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
that I feel that a lot of this can get
 
03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
um put into two instead of another
 
03:58:52.429 --> 03:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
separate committee um so just to uh
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
clarify though I'm not
 
03:58:57.309 --> 03:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
against um doing this kind of thing it's
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
just it sound to me like this is
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat redundant so that's why I'm
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
voting against it okay thank you
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
chairman so I worked at a community
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
mental health center from 1995 to 2005
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
so that was a long time ago and this was
 
03:59:18.030 --> 03:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
this was an issue then that um families
 
03:59:21.750 --> 03:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
who came in with um children with
 
03:59:24.070 --> 03:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
significant mental health needs if they
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
had Medicaid they got all kinds of
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
wraparound Services because those were
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
clearly reimbursed um but ironically if
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
they had private insurance um those same
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of services which would be like
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
case management or um
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
family support workers who went into the
 
03:59:50.189 --> 03:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
family to help with parenting those um
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
Services were not clearly reimbursed so
 
03:59:57.550 --> 03:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
here we are 25 years later with the same
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
issue and what I heard at the hearing
 
04:00:03.670 --> 04:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
was that it is clear now that those
 
04:00:06.550 --> 04:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
private insurers should be paying for
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
those services and do pay for those
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
Services because that's parody but but
 
04:00:13.279 --> 04:00:14.469 align:start position:0%
Services because that's parody but but
it

04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
but but the systems in place are not
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
working so it becomes incredibly
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to actually know the right
 
04:00:24.189 --> 04:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
codes or
 
04:00:28.269 --> 04:00:28.279 align:start position:0%
um to write um pre to write
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
pre-authorizations to get those services
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
so I think this is something that's been
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
in the works for decades and if you have
 
04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
a severely mentally ill child with all
 
04:00:43.950 --> 04:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of behavior issues that you're
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
struggling to keep in your home this is
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important issue and I
 
04:00:48.800 --> 04:00:50.950 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important issue and I
think

04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:00:54.149 --> 04:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
um you know once again I don't know that
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
a study committee will finally resolve
 
04:00:58.149 --> 04:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
it but I think we should be doing
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
everything we can to resolve it so I
 
04:01:01.990 --> 04:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
will vote for
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
this okay other discussion
 
04:01:06.429 --> 04:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
04:01:10.229 --> 04:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
chair I concur with repr sharo um mental
 
04:01:11.870 --> 04:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
health is a real issue for us in the
 
04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
state and we're vastly under
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
um servicing it resourcing it I think
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
it's time for us to do something about
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.189 --> 04:01:26.199 align:start position:0%

04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
Report and and there's no session next
 
04:03:10.349 --> 04:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
week so we're not under a strict
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
deadline but obviously I can get them in
 
04:03:16.870 --> 04:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
the next M Dyer the next day or so okay
 
04:03:20.189 --> 04:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
for these reports or do you need them
 
04:03:20.199 --> 04:03:23.030 align:start position:0%
for these reports or do you need them
today

04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no that's a little too
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
open-ended probably do them tonight
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
because there's 112 bills that still
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
need to be reported out and given that
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of work typing
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
this up so I'd suggest people get them
 
04:03:39.630 --> 04:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
in by tomorrow so do it tonight that' be
 
04:03:41.110 --> 04:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
great yeah thank you if you could do
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
that that includes me too so
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh moving on uh Senate Bill 412 FN
 
04:03:50.670 --> 04:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative kushman do you have a
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
motion yes I move a to pass on Senate
 
04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 412
 
04:03:58.229 --> 04:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
FN representative Missour seconds
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative kushman do you want to
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes thank you um so
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was pretty straightforward we
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
are um opening up temporarily the
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
moratorium on um existing long-term care
 
04:04:16.469 --> 04:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
beds for a pediatric Intermediate Care
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
Facility um we have some resident well
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
would be residents who are in need of
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
those beds so we're going to open it up
 
04:04:23.680 --> 04:04:24.550 align:start position:0%
those beds so we're going to open it up
for

04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
them and I do just want to mention
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
that I can't I can't make this motion
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
without saying something about the
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium in general that it's there to
 
04:04:37.790 --> 04:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
protect a um
 
04:04:41.469 --> 04:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
funding organized funding mechanism that
 
04:04:43.950 --> 04:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
is not sustainable and we end up with
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
shortages like this that end up driving
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
up health care costs and this is a
 
04:04:50.830 --> 04:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
short-term solution it's a Band-Aid and
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
we keep putting Band-Aids on it and I
 
04:04:55.550 --> 04:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
hope that eventually uh we find a way to
 
04:04:57.750 --> 04:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
get rid of this moratorium and and allow
 
04:05:00.149 --> 04:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
the uh free market to run things in the

representative McLean okay if everybody
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
um SP 461
 
04:08:47.229 --> 04:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
um is is is another bill that that's
 
04:08:52.990 --> 04:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
looking uh to uh have the state begin uh
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
the process of of gathering some
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
statistics around abortion um and and
 
04:09:02.109 --> 04:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
Reporting those statistics so we we we
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
heard in in testimony that there are
 
04:09:06.880 --> 04:09:08.389 align:start position:0%
heard in in testimony that there are
currently

04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
47 uh of the 50 states that that gather
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
and and provide information um around
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
abortion and I I think this is one area
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
where in concept no matter which side of
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
the abortion issue you stand on and and
 
04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a very heated issue um
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
there there is a consensus that
 
04:09:33.149 --> 04:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
Gathering some of these statistics would
 
04:09:35.070 --> 04:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
be a good thing and that's why very
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
pro-choice States like California and
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
New York do that you know and um the the
 
04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
goal is to be able to understand the
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
drive behind unwanted a pregnancy to to
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
look at you know what are the clinical
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
developments and things of that nature
 
04:09:54.750 --> 04:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
and you know I I went in online just to
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
kind of look at you know how is this
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
information used and was reading a whole
 
04:10:00.429 --> 04:10:00.439 align:start position:0%
bunch of different papers where they're
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
kind of drawing on this information so I
 
04:10:06.670 --> 04:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
think the information has value um of
 
04:10:08.910 --> 04:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
course the flying the ointment as as we
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
heard uh during the public hearing every
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
time I have representative Kirk come
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
before me and talk about privacy
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
concerns uh my antenna goes up because
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know I I share his concerns those of
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
you who don't know representative Kirk
 
04:10:27.389 --> 04:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
and I know representative Weber
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative McKay who've been here a
 
04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
while you you go back and you remember
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
the real ID debates and you know you'll
 
04:10:37.389 --> 04:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
remember the Constitution amendment of
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
2018 term after term after term so there
 
04:10:44.830 --> 04:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's nobody in whom I put more faith
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
that there's concerns around privacy
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
than than representative Kirk and so um
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment is doing is it's
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
trying to get at uh the statistics that
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
I think everybody thinks are valuable um
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
while being able to preserve um the the
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the woman and and
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that information is not
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
weaponized in any way so following the
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
the public hearing I went back to you
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
know representative Kirk a former
 
04:11:20.710 --> 04:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk sorry and I just
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
said could you you know work on the
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
language around an amendment and so he
 
04:11:29.429 --> 04:11:29.439 align:start position:0%
did that and that what you see reflected
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
here in front of you really is the bulk
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
of his work added to that um there were
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
some concerns you know from
 
04:11:38.710 --> 04:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant who said you
 
04:11:41.229 --> 04:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
know probably the the cleanest way to go
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
at this thing is to just have a fullon
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
optt out option for the woman to say you
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
know what I'm just not going to
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
participate in in the data Gathering
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
scheme so we can put all these
 
04:11:55.630 --> 04:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
Protections in place but the ultimate
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know Adam Bomb at the end of the day
 
04:12:03.070 --> 04:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
is giving um the woman the the option to
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
just completely opt out allog together I
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
just don't want to have any of my
 
04:12:10.750 --> 04:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
information go into this and so I think
 
04:12:13.870 --> 04:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
that goes far and above
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
what these other states are doing
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
because when I went in and I was reading
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
the papers that they're drafting you
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
know from this data they're talking
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
about demographic statistics they're
 
04:12:26.149 --> 04:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
talking about causation and when we look
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
at the
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
information that we are gathering um in
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
this bill this is very vanilla you know
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
compared to what I was reading um in in
 
04:12:40.990 --> 04:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
in the reports and the studies that have
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
drawn on the data from other states I
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
think this is really very vanilla so
 
04:12:48.389 --> 04:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
part of me says you know is this going
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of a lot of benefit but I
 
04:12:54.990 --> 04:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
think what it does is it is at least
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
goes in it kind of sets the framework
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
where we're Gathering some very vanilla
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
statistics and it's also setting up um
 
04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
an appropriation and this is something
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
again coming from former representative
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
Kirk not for me I don't want to take
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
false credit where he's setting up an
 
04:13:14.510 --> 04:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
approp ration to the Department of the
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
sum of $1 to hire such personnel and
 
04:13:20.109 --> 04:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
implements a secure computer facility
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know with the act so I can we afford
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
that in a non-budget year to appropriate
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
that much
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
money well you know that's having never
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
served in finance but he cheered Finance
 
04:13:33.790 --> 04:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll defer to him but I think
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
what what it does is it kind of sets up
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
that architecture so I think on balance
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
if if you look at it um it's going
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in the paragraph so go back on
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
to um the the first page line six
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
nothing in paragraph two shall be
 
04:13:54.309 --> 04:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
construed as requiring or permitting um
 
04:13:56.349 --> 04:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
so he was very clear we want to put that
 
04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
in um and we put uh the obviously the
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
medical facility um is still being
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
captured um because that has to go
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
obviously to DHS where where the
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
information is going to but the
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is very clear that even though
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
the medical facility is being in the
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
data that is being reported when the
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
report comes back to the general court
 
04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
that the the even the medical facility
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
is not going to be listed in there so
 
04:14:27.189 --> 04:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's making it further still to kind
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
of get into to geographical area
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
um the medical facility shall not report
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
either the name of the healthc care
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
provider performs the abortions or the
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
number of peror abortions performed by
 
04:14:43.109 --> 04:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
any individual health care provider
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
again so that's making sure that we're
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
not going back and weaponizing against
 
04:14:50.830 --> 04:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
the providers who who provide this
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
service um and then um and then not
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
withstanding the big thing is the
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
addition the whole addition of section
 
04:15:01.229 --> 04:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
four basically comes out of the
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
discussion with representative Merchant
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
let's just give the woman you know an
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opt out if she's not
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable if she feels that she's in a
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
rural area where it may be easy to ident
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
ify hey this is a small town she can
 
04:15:18.429 --> 04:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
just opt out the only thing that the
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
amendment does do it says it it it will
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
report just generically how many women
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
chose to opt out so um but it's not
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
tying that back to any individual at all
 
04:15:32.910 --> 04:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
so I think you know from the input of
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
these other folks it's again it's not a
 
04:15:39.389 --> 04:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
ton of information being gathered it's
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
very vanilla but it allows us to
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
establish the infrastructure with very
 
04:15:47.750 --> 04:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
vanilla information with a lot of
 
04:15:50.590 --> 04:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
Protections in place and remember 47
 
04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
other states do this including prolife
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
States because they see value in in the
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
information so um I hope you consider it
 
04:16:00.670 --> 04:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll support it and that's kind
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
of where I'm at thank you representative
 
04:16:07.550 --> 04:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
for the amendment I mean this
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
definitely improves it in my eye um
 
04:16:17.070 --> 04:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
and because the opt out covers an awful
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
lot of things the only thing I wondered
 
04:16:22.109 --> 04:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
is leaving in the state of residence of
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
the pregnant patient I could sort of see
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
where we'd want to know how many of
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
these people are actually New Hampshire
 
04:16:29.630 --> 04:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
residents but having just listened on
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
the way into the um fact that there was
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
a woman who went to Colorado to have an
 
04:16:36.269 --> 04:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
abortion and now the state of Texas is
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
trying to extract information from
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
Colorado about this abortion so they can
 
04:16:46.510 --> 04:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
charge the providers and the woman um
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
and Colorado has a shield law and we
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't and so I just wonder
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
if you know the opt out presumably that
 
04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
person would opt out of providing the
 
04:16:58.670 --> 04:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
information but I'm just a little bit
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much Mr chairman
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for all the work that you
 
04:17:09.389 --> 04:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
put in on this and I I certainly
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that the amendment goes away
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
towards um answering some of the privacy
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
issues that said um the issues that I
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
still have here are the issue raised by
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer about the state
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
that the other that the woman may have
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
come from um the gestational periods are
 
04:17:38.870 --> 04:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
divided in a way that doesn't seem to me
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
to make sense with the way these kinds
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
of proced procedures are handled because
 
04:17:47.469 --> 04:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
generally speaking medication abortion
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
goes up to 11 weeks and um after that
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
they're not appropriate it needs to be
 
04:17:59.149 --> 04:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
um a surgical abortion and this puts
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
that time
 
04:18:04.990 --> 04:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
frame I'm sorry that puts that time
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
frame precisely in the middle of one of
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
these divisions which doesn't seem
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
sensible to me um
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of a dollar's cost
 
04:18:18.309 --> 04:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
does not answer the problem that the
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
department will have of having to
 
04:18:24.030 --> 04:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
organize a way to uh address these
 
04:18:27.870 --> 04:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
statistics nor does it um help with the
 
04:18:29.950 --> 04:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
burden on the facilities that have to do
 
04:18:29.960 --> 04:18:30.990 align:start position:0%
burden on the facilities that have to do
the

04:18:30.990 --> 04:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:31.000 --> 04:18:32.750 align:start position:0%
the
reporting

04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure how this protects
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
somebody who might be a single provider
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
whose uh statistics might not be
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
aggregated as they would in in a large
 
04:18:44.640 --> 04:18:46.349 align:start position:0%
aggregated as they would in in a large
scale

04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
scale
 
04:18:51.550 --> 04:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
facility um and and finally um the the
 
04:18:56.149 --> 04:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
issue that I see is if we are trying to
 
04:18:59.229 --> 04:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
collect Val valuable and valid
 
04:18:59.239 --> 04:19:00.750 align:start position:0%
collect Val valuable and valid
statistical

04:19:00.750 --> 04:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
statistical
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
data uh the protections that we've put
 
04:19:05.469 --> 04:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
on to protect privacy all of which I'm
 
04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of uh make the the data all but
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
useless in terms of understanding what's
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
going on um I will vote for the
 
04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
amendment because I think it's
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
considerably better than the original
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill but I just want to say that my vote
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
for the amendment is conditioned on the
 
04:19:28.990 --> 04:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
fact that I'm incredibly offended at how
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us it was a bill that
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
was about something completely different
 
04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
and it was commandeered in the Senate
 
04:19:38.349 --> 04:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
and changed into something that it
 
04:19:43.349 --> 04:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't so my name under our rules is on
 
04:19:45.510 --> 04:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that I cannot support and will
 
04:19:47.670 --> 04:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
not support and would never have it in a
 
04:19:48.910 --> 04:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
million years
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
introduced um which is a fla and or
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
rules that I understand we can't deal
 
04:19:57.030 --> 04:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
with here uh but I I ultimately think
 
04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
that our law is correct the way it is
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to vote against the
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that input
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I hope that I'm not
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
in the same boat about having a bill
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
hijacked by the other body to be
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
something that I can't support we'll see
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
how today shakes out um looking at some
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
of these points that been raised um my
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
question would be if changing the state
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
of residence of the P pregnant patient
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
to um whether the the pregnant patient
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
is a resident of New Hampshire or not um
 
04:20:37.550 --> 04:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
to separate the sections into before 6 6
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
to 15 15 to 20 uh 20 to 24 and after 24
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
weeks would deal with that um the
 
04:20:45.910 --> 04:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
concern or if it should be a different
 
04:20:48.030 --> 04:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
date to do that uh because if we're
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
looking at how we would be impacted
 
04:20:52.590 --> 04:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
should somebody do the unthinkable and
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
look at Federal legislation uh because
 
04:20:57.030 --> 04:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is a state issue not a federal
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
issue uh that that would then give us
 
04:21:00.870 --> 04:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
information about how much that would
 
04:21:02.349 --> 04:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
impact our state so that we can
 
04:21:06.189 --> 04:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
appropriately respond to our um to our
 
04:21:08.349 --> 04:21:08.359 align:start position:0%
federal representatives and then
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
additionally um I do want to point out
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
that those who opt out the fact that
 
04:21:15.109 --> 04:21:15.119 align:start position:0%
they've opted out um so we essentially
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
get a null value but there was an
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
abortion performed that does not
 
04:21:21.109 --> 04:21:21.119 align:start position:0%
invalidate all the numbers it just means
 
04:21:23.309 --> 04:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
that some of it doesn't provide any of
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
this information that is valuable to
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
groups um such as that is valuable
 
04:21:31.109 --> 04:21:31.119 align:start position:0%
information and then finally in order to
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
deal with the concern about medical
 
04:21:36.189 --> 04:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
facilities and um even potentially the
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
date which had been a problem U been
 
04:21:41.149 --> 04:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
raised because of the idea of uh geoca
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
although I don't think there's enough in
 
04:21:46.030 --> 04:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
this to do this would changing it to the
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
month in which the abortion was
 
04:21:50.149 --> 04:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
performed allow us to at least have some
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
seasonal data so that if we find out
 
04:21:54.750 --> 04:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
that there's some month in which there's
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
a huge number of abortions perhaps there
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
should be some messaging around safe sex
 
04:22:01.630 --> 04:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
during whichever time period that is
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
that may make sense as a good policy
 
04:22:05.950 --> 04:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
position um and just so that we can have
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
some information on that so as as far as
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
that goes would that actually gain more
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
support or those of you who are against
 
04:22:14.309 --> 04:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
the bill against the bill even with
 
04:22:14.319 --> 04:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
the bill against the bill even with
those

04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
changes representative Weber speaking
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
only for myself um I I think that that
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
definitely helps with the Privacy issue
 
04:22:28.630 --> 04:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
but I think it makes the data collected
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
more less useful uh so I'm I'm going to
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
vote no in any case
 
04:22:37.870 --> 04:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
so representative McLean U yeah thank
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chair so yeah I mean and I
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
the comment that is the data so vanilla
 
04:22:50.189 --> 04:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
that it's not useful and like I said
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
when I went online and I'm reading the
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of studies and the things that
 
04:22:55.469 --> 04:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
they're doing with the data I can kind
 
04:22:57.269 --> 04:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
of see you know why you would would say
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
that but I think we're at a point right
 
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
now where the privacy concerns are
 
04:23:05.550 --> 04:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
trumping everything and so we're we're
 
04:23:08.670 --> 04:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
we're coming in intentionally vanilla to
 
04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
prove out the system which is why at
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
this point any
 
04:23:15.870 --> 04:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
that I could do you wanted to go to
 
04:23:17.950 --> 04:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
month you wanted to go to just a
 
04:23:20.590 --> 04:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire anything that
 
04:23:23.469 --> 04:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
I could do because right now privacy
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
concerns trumpet I'll do whatever I have
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
to do to kind of address those concerns
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
just to kind of establish the
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure prove out the
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and then come back and
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
revisit um but obviously I mean if if
 
04:23:38.790 --> 04:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's a hard no I mean I we'll just kind
 
04:23:42.429 --> 04:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
of go to it today um but just I'm just
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of throwing it out there it's
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
intentionally vanilla for a reason so
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair other discussion
 
04:23:48.800 --> 04:23:50.229 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair other discussion
representative

04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
04:23:54.189 --> 04:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
thank you represent clean for uh
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
bringing forth the amendment and
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
definitely listening to my concern about
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
the patient ability to opt out I think
 
04:24:03.670 --> 04:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's fundamental to uh our right here in
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to uh
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
minimize any information we're sharing
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
and our ability to protect that
 
04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
information at the same time I do have
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
concerns regard to some of the Phi one
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that I saw in here which
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
was not really spoke to is under line 18
 
04:24:23.429 --> 04:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
any prescriptions it doesn't say what
 
04:24:24.710 --> 04:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
information on the prescription is going
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be obtained so that's going to be
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
problematic because a lot of times you
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
can have Phi information etc etc um
 
04:24:35.070 --> 04:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's really concerning again back to
 
04:24:38.670 --> 04:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
privacy when you look at lines 16 and 17
 
04:24:40.510 --> 04:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
I think the critical point if I
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly is that most of
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
the time if you have a medical or
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
prescription abortion it's going to be
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
up until the age of 11 sorry age 11 11
 
04:24:51.149 --> 04:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
weeks so therefore I think it's an
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
actual cut off when you start looking at
 
04:24:54.990 --> 04:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
16 to 15 that's going to be problematic
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
because you can't separate surgical from
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
medication one when I look at also the
 
04:25:02.590 --> 04:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner reports and what we can
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
release it depends upon the commissioner
 
04:25:05.950 --> 04:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
what's out there it doesn't really say
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner can only release
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
aggregated data um there's really
 
04:25:13.590 --> 04:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in there says that
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
deems useful if you look at line 24 as
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.070 --> 04:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
useful and that's concerning because if
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
you have a change with a commissioner
 
04:25:27.269 --> 04:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
that philosophy can change vers it's
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
saying it can only release aggregated
 
04:25:29.279 --> 04:25:30.229 align:start position:0%
saying it can only release aggregated
data

04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
data
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
period um if you also look at the type
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
of medical facility my concern at that
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
point in time is that when you have
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
small communities that have a hospital
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
or you have a certain area I think it's
 
04:25:44.189 --> 04:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
better to talk about it at that point in
 
04:25:47.070 --> 04:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
time is what county is load loated in if
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's in County CFT inference Sal County
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
something like that versus the actual
 
04:25:54.630 --> 04:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
type of facility so those are the things
 
04:25:56.429 --> 04:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
I have concern on I also pick up in the
 
04:25:59.070 --> 04:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
comment that representative um Weber
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
talked about and also our chair I don't
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
think a dollar is going to go very far
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
to implement this I think we're going to
 
04:26:05.550 --> 04:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
ask the Department of Health Human
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
Services to take on a burden and not
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
fund it appropriately again it's
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate placed upon another
 
04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
agency that we're not appropriately
 
04:26:15.389 --> 04:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
funding that's my
 
04:26:18.429 --> 04:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
concerns representative mlan uh thank
 
04:26:21.469 --> 04:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
you chair so again um those
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
are valid points representative Merchant
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
especially the dollar I I'd be more than
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
happy to move the date out of year
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and and to work on it to kind of go
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
to those concerns but again it's
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
just I just if that's going to be what's
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
necessary to win support obviously I do
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
that if not I mean I think we'll kind of
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
go with where we are but but I mean if
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
if if if you think that those things
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
would help bridge the gap then I would
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
be more than happy you know to kind of
 
04:26:57.630 --> 04:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
hold off move it out of year with the
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
implementation so that we can get
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
through another budget cycle and kind of
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
bring some of these in so I'm I'm I'm
 
04:27:04.990 --> 04:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
more than open to that if you think that
 
04:27:06.750 --> 04:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's basically what would allow you to
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
get across the bridge representative
 
04:27:11.070 --> 04:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
Seth King and then representative Leon
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm a hard no on both
 
04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the underlying Bill
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to Echo what representative
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
Weber said earlier I don't like the fact
 
04:27:23.229 --> 04:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill uh was sponsored by a
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of people and it wasn't just a a
 
04:27:27.950 --> 04:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
minor change and minor difference in the
 
04:27:30.429 --> 04:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
bill uh that happens to sponsors all the
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
time but to completely just throw in the
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
garbage the original Bill and come up
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
with something that has totally
 
04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
different intent totally different
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
meaning that doesn't seem very right to
 
04:27:42.189 --> 04:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
me but even if you are going to do that
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
there should have at least been one
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
sender to come and speak in favor of
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't even they couldn't
 
04:27:48.269 --> 04:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
even muster one sender to come and speak
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
in favor of their own bill uh I didn't
 
04:27:51.910 --> 04:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that was very cool there was only
 
04:27:55.229 --> 04:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
one person to speak in favor of it and
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
and there was one moment in which he
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
said all these other states take this
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
information but New Hampshire just says
 
04:28:02.429 --> 04:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
does not report and I thought to myself
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's awesome I wish we did that for a
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
lot of things New Hampshire just does
 
04:28:08.149 --> 04:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
not report so that's just my attitude
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know and I there was a
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
bill uh similar that we we uh we did in
 
04:28:17.550 --> 04:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
in our committee uh recently that um
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh it was the same thing I just feel
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
like look it's legal if you don't like
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
it work to change it but these sorts of
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic things that were just going
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
to muck up the gears I mean that's not
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to change anybody's opinion it's
 
04:28:33.429 --> 04:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
just going to waste money we've got all
 
04:28:35.469 --> 04:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
the other states that we can look at for
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
reference if we want to um and the
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
battle for whether it should be legal or
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
not can be fought elsewhere it shouldn't
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
be fought in the bureau y so that's what
 
04:28:46.149 --> 04:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a hard know thanks representative L
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
and then representative pimer um thank
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I've been subbing and
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
finance so I don't have a ton of
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
experience but I've had a little bit of
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
trial by fire now uh there's quite a
 
04:28:57.630 --> 04:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
number of bills where there is $1
 
04:28:59.710 --> 04:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated um there's many where it
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
does begin at the beginning of the next
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so it would be very much in
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
it would conform very much with a lot of
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
other bills that they are seeing in
 
04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
finance if it was $1 and if it started
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025 because there's no
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
positions created so because there and
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
that would be out of our scope to create
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
those positions but um if those
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
positions were if there with no
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
positions created that would be going
 
04:29:24.269 --> 04:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
into the budget next budget cycle
 
04:29:26.189 --> 04:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
request and by having it there that
 
04:29:27.630 --> 04:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
would be something that they are already
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
looking to do within that whole
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
framework um and then just looking to
 
04:29:33.870 --> 04:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
the the issue about nobody coming in to
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
support it I'm sure you've seen me
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
running back and forth between here and
 
04:29:39.109 --> 04:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
um at least two committees over in the
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
other body um the Judiciary Committee
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
and health and human services are
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
meeting at the same time as us um so
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's very hard especially for those
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
chairs to make it over here so it's uh
 
04:29:53.469 --> 04:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
one of one of the unfortunate features
 
04:29:57.109 --> 04:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
of our scheduling representative Palmer
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
okay any other discussion representative
 
04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes thank you Mr chairman I I
 
04:30:07.149 --> 04:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the effort to um
 
04:30:08.670 --> 04:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
however you put this make it more
 
04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
vanilla or protect um you know protect
 
04:30:14.469 --> 04:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
privacy and I'm particularly
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
appreciative of lines 21 lines 22 where
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
it says um basically that the medical
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
facilities shall not report the name of
 
04:30:26.349 --> 04:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
the provider or how many abortions
 
04:30:29.070 --> 04:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
they've provided because I think um
 
04:30:31.309 --> 04:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's a very real danger for providers
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
and that's a little bit of protection
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
but um so I will vote for the amendment
 
04:30:38.790 --> 04:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
but I won't vote for the bill and my
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
reasoning is really that um this is a
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
time of such flux and change which comes
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
along with as much as you said you don't
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
want something that can be weaponized I
 
04:30:53.309 --> 04:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
think in this in this moment in history
 
04:30:55.149 --> 04:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to find anything
 
04:30:59.910 --> 04:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.189 --> 04:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
um I I'm just concerned about doing
 
04:31:06.269 --> 04:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
anything that will
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
um add for me I'm I'm very hesitant to
 
04:31:16.189 --> 04:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
do anything that may um add to further
 
04:31:19.030 --> 04:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions to restrict abortion and I
 
04:31:22.349 --> 04:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
I I I I know this people talk about
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
public health um but as you know often
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have the text of the bill and then we
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
have the subtext and it's hard for me to
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
feel that this isn't being pushed
 
04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
because um of an agenda and I'm not I'm
 
04:31:40.590 --> 04:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
not saying this about any particular
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
person but in to eventually restrict
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
abortion and that's not something I want
 
04:31:50.590 --> 04:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
to participate in representative Bill
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman and um thank
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
you uh representative uh mlan for uh the
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
work that you put into this I on the
 
04:32:05.710 --> 04:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
surface I support this bill um but I'm
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
not going to vote for it and a lot of
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
the chatter that's been going on um not
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
chatter but uh the discussion that's
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
been going on um has has pushed me in
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
that direction
 
04:32:24.469 --> 04:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
I this is a bill that it's the second
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
time I've seen this I think the other
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
one was about two years ago and it IT
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
addresses a problem that we have when
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
when abortion is brought up and that
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
is how many abortions are done after 24
 
04:32:41.319 --> 04:32:42.630 align:start position:0%
is how many abortions are done after 24
weeks

04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
how many abortions are done after 15
 
04:32:48.510 --> 04:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
weeks nobody knows nobody has any data
 
04:32:51.389 --> 04:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
and then and we're going to see it in
 
04:32:53.910 --> 04:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
the next few months we're going to see
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of abortion commercials that flat
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
out tell lies and the reason why they
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
can lie is because there's no data to
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
support the lie or to support the truth
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I think we really need
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
to have this data I just don't think
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and quite honestly I don't
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
really like the fact that they took a
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
bill that was addressing something else
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
and then turned it into something else
 
04:33:25.230 --> 04:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
and um so for that reason I'm not going
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
to vote for this bill but I and um in
 
04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
support of what uh representative mlan
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
has done I'm going to I'm going to vote
 
04:33:35.789 --> 04:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.269 --> 04:33:42.279 align:start position:0%

amendment
yes's

04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
yes's
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
that can we do I
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't okay we have received the
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
amendment on 419 FN so we'll go back to
 
04:39:56.400 --> 04:39:58.030 align:start position:0%
amendment on 419 FN so we'll go back to
that

04:39:58.030 --> 04:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
direction so I won't get into the
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
details but I'll just give you that
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
first bite as this passes around this is
 
04:40:13.230 --> 04:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
language um that came um from the
 
04:40:15.230 --> 04:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
department and from Michael Hol to make
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
sure that the language was something
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
that would be um a little bit more
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to implement uh or a little
 
04:40:22.750 --> 04:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
bit more effective to implement and to
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
not get into privacy issues so I'll let
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
everybody actually read it before I say
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
more but I figured I'd just give that
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.788 --> 04:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
um yes this this one here I think was
 
04:40:52.110 --> 04:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
passed out before I actually have
 
04:40:53.948 --> 04:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
another amendment Beyond this but this
 
04:40:56.430 --> 04:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
is sort of the meat of it and the rest
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
is uh the potatoes and
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
gravy so is there to be another
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
amendment after this one um yes there is
 
04:41:05.110 --> 04:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want me to hand that
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
if we just wanted to look at this and
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
see if we wanted it and then go to the
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
next I'm very uncomfortable voting on
 
04:41:11.948 --> 04:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
anything without knowing everything
 
04:41:14.550 --> 04:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's in the package okay I and that
 
04:41:16.350 --> 04:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
would be really I can do that the other
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment does not touch any of the
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
language that is in this the other
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment adds House Bill 1231 which is
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
the hom grow statute because um
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
that because uh that is something that
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
would be very necessary to protect
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
patients should this become something
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done through Pharmacy
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
and if the alternative treatment centers
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
are shut down if there's a change from
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the FDA thank you so if it's okay to
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
wait on that one I just figured i' Focus
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
happy to wait on it being assured that
 
04:41:46.510 --> 04:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's completely different yes it's it's
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
not even exactly the same and completely
 
04:41:51.868 --> 04:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
different it's completely different so
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
um so thank you yes this is the one that
 
04:41:56.150 --> 04:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
um we that I believe had been passed out
 
04:41:57.788 --> 04:41:57.798 align:start position:0%
I think it was either at the hearing or
 
04:41:58.990 --> 04:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
soon after that you want to make a
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
motion oh yes I'd like to make a motion
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
2024-25 I'll second that and
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative McLean seconds I proceed
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
reprentative L thank you um so this
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is drafted so that there is
 
04:42:18.030 --> 04:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to back to that privacy
 
04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
issue that we were just talking about on
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
the abortion statistics and about the
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
medical providers the other one would
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
have had a lot of information that had
 
04:42:27.868 --> 04:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
to do with specific operations of those
 
04:42:29.470 --> 04:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:42:32.350 --> 04:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
program being reported this then makes
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
it so that instead of giving those
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
details of the reports it talks about
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
the number of alter alternative
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
treatment center plans of Correction to
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
address the areas of non-compliance the
 
04:42:43.510 --> 04:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
number of hearings held the number of
 
04:42:45.550 --> 04:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
statements of finding that were issued
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
when as a result of an inspection
 
04:42:49.230 --> 04:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
complainer monitoring the department
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
determines that the ATC is in violation
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
of are not in compliance with any of
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
those um and the number of
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
Investigations as opposed to giving
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
details about which ATC is involved um I
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that um this is a more
 
04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of transparency should
 
04:43:07.628 --> 04:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
there be findings of problems then we
 
04:43:09.868 --> 04:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
have other issues to deal with and given
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
that there's three ATC
 
04:43:13.550 --> 04:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
um that's something that we can address
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that um airing
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
inspection results or anything else like
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
that publicly um and things that are
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
available under public records requests
 
04:43:25.628 --> 04:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
makes much sense especially given the uh
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
delicate dance between federal and state
 
04:43:31.550 --> 04:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
laws around this so I I hope we can
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
adopt this
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman maybe I'm
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
just being thick but I I I'm
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
where specifically are the differences
 
04:43:46.628 --> 04:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and the bill let
 
04:43:48.030 --> 04:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
me pull it up I know it's the same
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
section so I will pull up the actual
 
04:43:52.030 --> 04:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
bill so I can tell you the difference I
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
it and I was looking to pull that up
 
04:44:02.990 --> 04:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
myself so not a problem I do know that
 
04:44:04.830 --> 04:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
04:44:10.590 --> 04:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
see so on uh J um which is line 21 of of
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
this in that we can see what the
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
amendment says but the bill as it came
 
04:44:16.990 --> 04:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
to us says the statements of finding
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
that were issued when as a result of any
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
inspection complaint or monitoring the
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
department determines that the ATC is in
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
violation so ours would have this
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
amendment would say the number of
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
statements of finding that were issued
 
04:44:30.350 --> 04:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
as opposed to publishing these
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
statements of finding um then in k um
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
our Amendment says the number of ATC
 
04:44:40.430 --> 04:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
plans of Correction while um the bill as
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
it came to us says the ATC plans of
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
Correction so the actual plans and
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
details um so those are the two changes
 
04:44:47.878 --> 04:44:49.430 align:start position:0%
details um so those are the two changes
thank

04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
Weber so um are am I right in thinking
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
that uh the findings themselves and the
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
plan of Corrections are already public
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
documents um no I don't I don't believe
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
that they're currently public documents
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I'm not sure but I'm not
 
04:45:14.230 --> 04:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
sure how having the commissioner's data
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
report including that data makes
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
sense okay why you have information on
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
that if we could pull somebody Abby
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
Rogers from the Department is here and
 
04:45:24.310 --> 04:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
you hi Abby Rogers legislatively aison
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
for the division of Public Health
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
Services um I actually covered this bill
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
for Mr H because he's out um on leave
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is uh there are
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
postings in the atc's public postings of
 
04:45:46.350 --> 04:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
information as well as as uh you know
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
the information is is available through
 
04:45:50.990 --> 04:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
a right to no request but it is publicly
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
available at the atcs it's my
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
understanding so follow up so my
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
followup is that they're already
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
available I see no reason to put anybody
 
04:46:04.990 --> 04:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
through the um extra work of assembling
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
them again I think that the amendment
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you other discussion
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
saying none
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
okay all right the motion is ought to
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
pass on 2024
 
04:46:23.550 --> 04:46:23.560 align:start position:0%

04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%

04:48:15.990 --> 04:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill
 
04:48:19.628 --> 04:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
419 do I have a second representative
 
04:48:19.638 --> 04:48:23.110 align:start position:0%
419 do I have a second representative
kushman

04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
seconds okay um and speaking to this um
 
04:48:30.430 --> 04:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
we now see that the um that there's a
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
very very high likelihood that cannabis
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
is and I didn't actually intend the joke
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
that time usually I
 
04:48:41.110 --> 04:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
do um there the the likelihood is very
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
high that um I'm not going to be able to
 
04:48:46.548 --> 04:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
stop so I'm just going to keep keep I
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
was going to make another I'm not that
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
punny um so there's a this will likely
 
04:48:54.750 --> 04:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
be rescheduled from schedule one to
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
schedule 3 uh that is great because now
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
there can be research done into all
 
04:49:00.750 --> 04:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
these medical uses but this is going to
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
be highly problematic because schedule
 
04:49:05.310 --> 04:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
three drugs are dispensed through phes
 
04:49:07.590 --> 04:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
generally schedule three drugs are done
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
through FDA approval which are generally
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
not for plants generally they are for
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
for um drugs or for biologics they are
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
not really prepared to handle any of
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
this um if we end up into the Quagmire
 
04:49:27.030 --> 04:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
of how they Square class three um
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
scheduling of cannabis with continued
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
access to therapeutic cannabis it
 
04:49:34.110 --> 04:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
becomes very very critical that patients
 
04:49:36.750 --> 04:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
will have some way to access it and this
 
04:49:38.230 --> 04:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
isn't an area where we would be an
 
04:49:40.270 --> 04:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
island of prohibition with other states
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
around us
 
04:49:42.670 --> 04:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
there's a decent chance that other
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
states won't be able to deal with this
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
either and this could be a very
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
significant um issue going on so by
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
allow permitting homerow um home
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
cultivation for therapeutic cannabis for
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
patients we won't interrupt that use of
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis for patients who otherwise may
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
be on opioids or other more harmful
 
04:50:06.430 --> 04:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
drugs um so I mean it may seem like I'm
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
in a Christmas tree mode and uh feeling
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
with some of what I've said today I
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
think that this is absolutely critical
 
04:50:15.270 --> 04:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that patients are able to
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
continue to access cannabis if um if the
 
04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
if the declassification of cannabis
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
market representative
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
Weber so what I'm trying to figure out
 
04:50:35.310 --> 04:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
is uh you know I I was in support of
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
this when it went through the house um
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that you without knowing
 
04:50:43.628 --> 04:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
that you may have um attached this
 
04:50:44.990 --> 04:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
because the Senate did something
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
different with it is that correct um I
 
04:50:49.948 --> 04:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
believe that it had a report of interim
 
04:50:51.628 --> 04:50:51.638 align:start position:0%
study um I'm not sure if it actually
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
went to the floor so I will find that
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
right now but I know that at least
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
coming out of committee it had interim
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
study and I did get a message today that
 
04:51:01.230 --> 04:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
um at least one Judiciary member is
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely adamant that hom grow not um
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
move forward at least on the
 
04:51:04.760 --> 04:51:06.948 align:start position:0%
move forward at least on the
recreational

04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
04:51:12.270 --> 04:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I will get that on there with that
 
04:51:18.628 --> 04:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
information for which I thank you I
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
here's here's my concern I'm absolutely
 
04:51:22.750 --> 04:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
in support of this for all of the
 
04:51:24.628 --> 04:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
reasons that representative leyon has
 
04:51:28.270 --> 04:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
just stated uh but we know what the POS
 
04:51:33.310 --> 04:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
Senate position is likely to be and I am
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
not a
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
fan of adding things to other things and
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
confusing the issue it seems to me that
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
we had a fairly good bill um that we all
 
04:51:50.110 --> 04:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
agreed on or most of us agreed on not
 
04:51:54.510 --> 04:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
all of us um and that seems to me to be
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
good policy and
 
04:52:00.868 --> 04:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
putting that bill in a position where
 
04:52:03.310 --> 04:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
the good policy that we enact there is
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
very likely to Simply die because they
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the policy they've
 
04:52:09.868 --> 04:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
already disagreed with doesn't seem to
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
me to be like a helpful thing to do so
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh speaking solely for myself although I
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
support the content entirely I don't
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
think I can vote for putting it on a
 
04:52:22.080 --> 04:52:23.868 align:start position:0%
think I can vote for putting it on a
different

04:52:23.868 --> 04:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill but I'm I'm willing to be persuaded
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
if somebody has a really good reason but
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nel I I just have a
 
04:52:35.750 --> 04:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
question I mean I'm as a neop fight um
 
04:52:38.030 --> 04:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
this seems very non- gerine to me what
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
what do does that mean anything
 
04:52:46.110 --> 04:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
yeah the answer is that under our rules
 
04:52:48.270 --> 04:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
um a gerine Amendment either has to be
 
04:52:50.110 --> 04:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
Germain to the subject matter or it has
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be something that the house already
 
04:52:54.830 --> 04:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
passed and it is the position of the
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
house so under our rules it is gerine
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
even though that word will make your
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
brain bounce in terms of this in terms
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
of this um
 
04:53:09.190 --> 04:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
and it is another one of those practices
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
that the Senate attaches things to our
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
bills so we have made sure that we can
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
attach things to their bills I don't
 
04:53:20.070 --> 04:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
think it's productive in either case um
 
04:53:22.708 --> 04:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
I agree H just like I don't think it's
 
04:53:24.430 --> 04:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
fair to keep people you know if somebody
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
wants to change a bill completely let
 
04:53:30.310 --> 04:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
people take their name off it but um I I
 
04:53:33.788 --> 04:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
I don't see the H that in this case the
 
04:53:36.548 --> 04:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
tactic is useful it is useful in some
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
cases so am I allowed to say one other
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
thing sure go ahead I've never supported
 
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
this and I'm not going to
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
know representative Leon did you want to
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
um I I'll let others speak I represent
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative chapero and then
 
04:53:52.110 --> 04:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative kushman ju just following
 
04:53:54.030 --> 04:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman just following
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
up on representative Weber's comments I
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
I would ask representative Leon if you
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
have any indication that this will get a
 
04:54:06.548 --> 04:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
better reception in the full Senate this
 
04:54:09.548 --> 04:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
time um so thank you for that question
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
um when they were deal with this the
 
04:54:13.948 --> 04:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
ruling coming out of the um coming out
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the federal government about the
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
declassification had not come out yet um
 
04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
I know that they are just as busy with
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
as many topics as we are um and the idea
 
04:54:26.350 --> 04:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
of having that knowledge about that de
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
declassification and the implications of
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
it um be something that is front and
 
04:54:31.708 --> 04:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
center for them I don't think is
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
happening because Health and Human
 
04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
Services in the Senate usually isn't the
 
04:54:37.470 --> 04:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
one that deals with cannabis at least
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
last year all of that was in Senate
 
04:54:41.548 --> 04:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
Judiciary this time that went to Senate
 
04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so they have
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
less experience in that field and
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
um and there's I mean there's a chance
 
04:54:50.390 --> 04:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the that their floor will do
 
04:54:52.548 --> 04:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
something differently because um it was
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
a 3-2 vote in committee for interim
 
04:54:58.510 --> 04:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
study um there's a decent chance that it
 
04:55:00.670 --> 04:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
actually especi that especially if it
 
04:55:02.230 --> 04:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
comes to their attention because we're
 
04:55:04.830 --> 04:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
doing this um there's a very good chance
 
04:55:06.190 --> 04:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
that they may change their mind on the
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
floor um so we have that possibility and
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
that change if there are people that
 
04:55:12.390 --> 04:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
support one and then the other we could
 
04:55:15.548 --> 04:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
always have the Blended of these two as
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of the positions and then the other
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
house position could be with only the
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.868 --> 04:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
adopted representative Coachman did I
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
just ask the point of clarification sure
 
04:55:30.670 --> 04:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
the house can't have two positions the
 
04:55:32.430 --> 04:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
house will either vote one way or the
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
other I'm sorry the committee because we
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
have a minority and a major majority
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
when this bill came when 1231 came
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
through initially it was 154 on the
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
regular calendar so this isn't going to
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
be a consent calendar anyways
 
04:55:47.310 --> 04:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative kosman thank you Mr
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just want to um voice my
 
04:55:53.110 --> 04:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
support for this amendment um I'd like
 
04:55:54.990 --> 04:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
that second bite at the Apple with the
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
new information coming down from the
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
federal government and um I would like
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
to hope that the Senate will reconsider
 
04:56:03.788 --> 04:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
their position um since it well
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
especially it was only the committee not
 
04:56:07.868 --> 04:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
the full um Senate who's had their vote
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
and I mean this home grow as aspect of
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
of any um whether it's legalization or
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
expanding that um hom grow option to um
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis I think it's
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
very important for Safe products and for
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
patient access thank you representative
 
04:56:26.000 --> 04:56:27.070 align:start position:0%
patient access thank you representative
of

04:56:27.070 --> 04:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:56:30.548 --> 04:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
Nel I I just feel obligated to say this
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
um I've been involved in this discussion
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
for a very long period of time I kind of
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
take issue with the statement that
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis is safer than opioids all the
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
the opioid data that we have is
 
04:56:44.350 --> 04:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
basically flawed they basically looked
 
04:56:46.270 --> 04:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
at deaths without looking at all the
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
factors involved and the more we've
 
04:56:49.628 --> 04:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
looked at the factors involved all the
 
04:56:51.868 --> 04:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
deaths related to opioid use were
 
04:56:53.548 --> 04:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
actually related to poly Pharmacy and
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
not single use of opioid when you
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
basically remove all the extraneous
 
04:57:01.430 --> 04:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
factors and look at the opioid alone the
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose death rate is at least
 
04:57:06.270 --> 04:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
in a prescribed fashion is really not
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
that high it's when you start combining
 
04:57:10.510 --> 04:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
things together at the same time we kind
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
of trivialize the adverse effects of
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis that we're seeing increasing
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
and increasing as we're looking at the
 
04:57:18.750 --> 04:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
increased use of it and I I'd be honest
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
I'm really afraid for our youth these
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
days that they're having increased
 
04:57:24.270 --> 04:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
access to these substances and what
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to mean for the rest of
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
their lives and I I really seriously
 
04:57:30.628 --> 04:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
think that we have to remember that when
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
we make these policies I I'm not a big
 
04:57:34.910 --> 04:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
advocate of
 
04:57:37.868 --> 04:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
people growing their own scheduled drugs
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
at home I I I really do have a problem
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
in whether it's a schedule two or a
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
schedule three or a schedule one it's
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
still a scheduled drug and I understand
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
the concept of access I think we can
 
04:57:50.110 --> 04:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
manage that a lot better than allowing
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
people to grow it on their own at home
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
so and I I just like the other Bill fine
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
without adding this to it so I I can't
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
support the amendment I like the
 
04:57:59.680 --> 04:58:01.030 align:start position:0%
support the amendment I like the
original

04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
original
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
Bill another
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Seth King
 
04:58:08.110 --> 04:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair originally I wasn't
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to support the original bill at
 
04:58:12.430 --> 04:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
all I didn't like another data bill um
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
but the idea of slapping this on there
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
appeals to me
 
04:58:20.350 --> 04:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
um this is this if we passed this
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment this would no longer be a data
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill with a homow attached it would be
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion a hom grow bill with a
 
04:58:27.070 --> 04:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
datab bill
 
04:58:29.310 --> 04:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
attached um which I kind of like you
 
04:58:30.750 --> 04:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
know two can play the game that the
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
Senate likes to play um and you know the
 
04:58:35.788 --> 04:58:35.798 align:start position:0%
Congress does this a lot too well they
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
have these bills that just have so many
 
04:58:39.750 --> 04:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
different non- gerine things attached to
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
them and and there have been a lot of
 
04:58:43.628 --> 04:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
rights that have been won as a result of
 
04:58:44.948 --> 04:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately there have also been
 
04:58:46.548 --> 04:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of rights that have been lost as a
 
04:58:48.670 --> 04:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
result of that method this is a way we
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
can use it to gain some rights so that's
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
why I'm voting for it representative
 
04:58:57.030 --> 04:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you um I just have a kind
 
04:59:00.430 --> 04:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
of procedural question so if we pass
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment then when it gets to the
 
04:59:05.830 --> 04:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
floor the we'd have to vote on the
 
04:59:09.390 --> 04:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
amendment first anyway right is that um
 
04:59:12.150 --> 04:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
if we if so if the committee comes out
 
04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
with a majority position of both
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
amendments combined it would first be
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
that combined Amendment if that's
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
defeated on the floor and if the
 
04:59:22.948 --> 04:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
minority position is as we've already
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
amended it then that would be the second
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
motion would be that second minority
 
04:59:27.000 --> 04:59:28.350 align:start position:0%
motion would be that second minority

to the floor in the reports there's two
 
05:03:32.110 --> 05:03:32.120 align:start position:0%

Amendment or is there a report for both
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
collectively believe they consolidate
 
05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
don't they representative Weber yes they
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
they will take the two amendments and
 
05:03:42.270 --> 05:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
consolidate them into a it will the
 
05:03:43.510 --> 05:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
amendment will have a different
 
05:03:43.520 --> 05:03:45.070 align:start position:0%
amendment will have a different
amendment

05:03:45.070 --> 05:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:03:47.708 --> 05:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
number just to make things more
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
confusing but they'll put them into the
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
same Amendment as the committee
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then uh
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
15 uh 32 will will come out as the
 
05:03:59.040 --> 05:04:01.470 align:start position:0%
15 uh 32 will will come out as the
minority

05:04:01.470 --> 05:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
minority
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment any any other questions yes um
 
05:04:07.030 --> 05:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
I I guess just looking as we're going on
 
05:04:08.190 --> 05:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it would make sense to
 
05:04:09.910 --> 05:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
miss skip the two that we had the your
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
main hearings on this morning if we can
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
tuck them in on the end before people
 
05:04:16.470 --> 05:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
need to go wonderful but um otherwise I
 
05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if it makes sense to go to
 
05:04:19.390 --> 05:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
554 that not going to be my next
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
question if we were going to have enough
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
time to get into get into those um I
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
have no if there's no objection one we
 
05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
just go to 554 FN then is that what
 
05:04:31.390 --> 05:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting representative yes
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm suggesting because we we
 
05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
would like a little bit more time for
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
other amendments but if uh that means
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
coming back a separate day we can
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
probably make something work today
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
and I know a number of people do have to
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
leave at 3:00 so uh 550 SB 554 FN
 
05:04:50.110 --> 05:04:50.120 align:start position:0%

05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:51.520 --> 05:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
do

05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.708 --> 05:08:25.718 align:start position:0%
no you already representative mer thank
 
05:08:28.030 --> 05:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'd like to make a motion
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
to pass Amendment 2024 1831 H okay
 
05:08:35.708 --> 05:08:35.718 align:start position:0%
motions out to pass on 515 on the
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a second second
 
05:08:40.510 --> 05:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber second
 
05:08:41.910 --> 05:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes I do um basically
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
the vaccine program is uh what they call
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
Universal vaccine program what that does
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
is it allows the providers including
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to put money into a pot to
 
05:09:00.190 --> 05:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
allow for the vaccines for children to
 
05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
be covered so the parents don't have to
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
worry about the cost of the vaccines
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's really unique not unique to New
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but New Hampshire is one of
 
05:09:10.270 --> 05:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
the states that does this it's been a
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
tremendous asset to many many parents
 
05:09:14.190 --> 05:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
many many families because they've been
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
able to get the vaccines for the
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
children without incurring a financial
 
05:09:23.030 --> 05:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
burden the bill or the amendment to the
 
05:09:25.230 --> 05:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
bill does not speak to the Merit of the
 
05:09:27.230 --> 05:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine we're not talking about you know
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
what the merits are of the vaccine we're
 
05:09:29.708 --> 05:09:29.718 align:start position:0%
talking about coverage Financial
 
05:09:31.230 --> 05:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
coverage of the vaccine so I to separate
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
the issue about the vaccine itself as
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
far as its merits we're not here at
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
least I think to talk about that part of
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
it talk about how we can cover the
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine for the
 
05:09:43.628 --> 05:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
families um number two the vaccine
 
05:09:46.110 --> 05:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
itself is extremely expensive it retails
 
05:09:49.548 --> 05:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
at about $500 per dose um it's when you
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
think about that amount of dollars
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
coming out of a family particular those
 
05:09:55.990 --> 05:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
on the lower end of the social economic
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
barrier and talk about the benefit it
 
05:09:59.310 --> 05:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
has for the children it's a tremendous
 
05:10:03.070 --> 05:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
asset to them um and number three i'
 
05:10:04.350 --> 05:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
would say this I heard from the
 
05:10:06.270 --> 05:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
committee before we talked about trying
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
to expand it from the normal vaccines to
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
it we called biological vaccines so what
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
I heard loud and clear from this
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
committee was the use of the biological
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
products or trying to expand it Beyond
 
05:10:22.628 --> 05:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
RSV was not going to sell well so I went
 
05:10:22.638 --> 05:10:23.390 align:start position:0%
RSV was not going to sell well so I went
back

05:10:23.390 --> 05:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:10:26.430 --> 05:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
to amend the amendment amend the bill
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
with this amendment to clearly State all
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is RSV and RSV only
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time what I'm
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
proposing to the committee is that we
 
05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
narrow things down take the word
 
05:10:40.270 --> 05:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
biological product out of it so it's not
 
05:10:42.670 --> 05:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
Broad and make it very narrow to deal
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
with this one vaccine so I again to mind
 
05:10:47.948 --> 05:10:47.958 align:start position:0%
people this is a tremendous
 
05:10:51.548 --> 05:10:51.558 align:start position:0%
benefit to the patient the child to the
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
family um it does not talk to the Merit
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the vaccine it's not mandating the
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine all it's doing is allowing for
 
05:11:00.628 --> 05:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
financial assistance to those who are
 
05:11:02.590 --> 05:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
going to get the vaccine so we don't
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
have to worry about families not having
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to pay for
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
it other discussion representative
 
05:11:08.878 --> 05:11:10.310 align:start position:0%
it other discussion representative
Coachman

05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
Coachman
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um thank you for
 
05:11:14.590 --> 05:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
bringing this amendment um I know that
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
there is good intention behind this but
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh based on the performance of the
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association I don't want to give
 
05:11:24.670 --> 05:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
them any more uh Power at all um
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
Additionally the use of the word vaccine
 
05:11:29.830 --> 05:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
to talk about a monoclonal antibody is a
 
05:11:32.230 --> 05:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
total misnomer they're not vaccines they
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't even contain an antigen they're
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
more closely um described as IVIG it's
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
an immunoglobulin
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's a synthetically made one
 
05:11:45.868 --> 05:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
instead of one that is uh put into a
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
solution from pulled BL uh blood serum
 
05:11:52.030 --> 05:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think that this expands the
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
scope of the vaccine Association uh
 
05:11:57.310 --> 05:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
markedly the state should not be in the
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
business of purchasing
 
05:12:01.788 --> 05:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
vaccines um it it it gives the state the
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
incentive to sell vaccines and thereby
 
05:12:06.910 --> 05:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
Market them and I don't think that's an
 
05:12:08.430 --> 05:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate position for the state to be
 
05:12:10.270 --> 05:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
in I i' rather see the vaccine
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
Association 126q RSA repealed fully
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
mlan uh thank you Mr chair and and thank
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
you for bringing forth the amendment um
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
I definitely think that uh the the
 
05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
amendment uh moves things uh in the
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
right direction and and I'm I'm going to
 
05:12:30.990 --> 05:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
support the amendment um I'm not going
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
to support the underlying bill for for
 
05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
reasons I'll talk about when we get into
 
05:12:38.590 --> 05:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
that but you know I think that this
 
05:12:38.600 --> 05:12:39.990 align:start position:0%
that but you know I think that this
amendment

05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh takes the bill a long way in a
 
05:12:44.430 --> 05:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
positive direction and you never know
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen on the floor in a
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
very tightly divided house and so I am
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
way a thousand times more comfortable uh
 
05:12:54.270 --> 05:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
with this amendment and than I am the
 
05:12:56.670 --> 05:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill and and so in that light
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support it and I would
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody else to do so as
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
05:13:04.788 --> 05:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
bazov thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
for bringing this amendment I agree that
 
05:13:09.990 --> 05:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh
 
05:13:13.788 --> 05:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
it it makes um it makes it better but I
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
still not comfortable with it and um two
 
05:13:22.910 --> 05:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
points were made that about excess and
 
05:13:27.150 --> 05:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
about price so about price I think it's
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
unfair comparing discounted price That
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association allegedly can get to
 
05:13:37.628 --> 05:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
the full listed price uh because as we
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
know every insurance company or every uh
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
bulk buyer can negotiate the listed
 
05:13:47.948 --> 05:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
price down and they do negotiate so uh
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
if it listed for uh 500 it doesn't mean
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
that everyone buys it for
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
500 uh and uh then about access uh uh I
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe that uh everyone who FS
 
05:14:03.878 --> 05:14:04.708 align:start position:0%
uh I I believe that uh everyone who FS
those

05:14:04.708 --> 05:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:14:04.718 --> 05:14:06.510 align:start position:0%
those
antibodies

05:14:06.510 --> 05:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
antibodies
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
already have access to it and uh
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
coverage as a father of young child I
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
can testify from my experience my
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
pediatrician had no problem offering it
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
to me and even like uh marketing it as a
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh even though it's antibodies I
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
lat explained uh that it's not
 
05:14:34.430 --> 05:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccine but uh they have no
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
problem offering it to people so uh for
 
05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
for for
 
05:14:42.270 --> 05:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
for this reason and agreeing with what
 
05:14:44.868 --> 05:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
representative kushman said I won't be
 
05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment other the
 
05:14:49.948 --> 05:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Merchant thank
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
um question is correct it's not a
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccine but it is vaccine
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's what to call passive um we have
 
05:15:00.548 --> 05:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
also rabes vaccine rabes vaccine is also
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
passive it's antibodies because you
 
05:15:03.548 --> 05:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
don't have time if you're bitten by a
 
05:15:05.788 --> 05:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
rabid animal to develop your own
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
antibodies against the vaccine by the
 
05:15:08.510 --> 05:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
time you did that you probably wouldn't
 
05:15:10.910 --> 05:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
be here so it's passive and the same
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
thing with RSV and some other vaccines
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
that are known as passive vaccines we
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
call them vaccines um number two in
 
05:15:20.868 --> 05:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
regards to rep close off by May the
 
05:15:23.070 --> 05:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
reason why we go through the universal
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
program is it allows the state state
 
05:15:27.750 --> 05:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't sell it all the state's doing is
 
05:15:29.830 --> 05:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
acting as a procurement agent to allow
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
it for distribution the actual use of it
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
is done by providers and by those
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
individuals the state's really not
 
05:15:38.030 --> 05:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
selling anything L is acting as a
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
conduit and the reason why we do that is
 
05:15:41.750 --> 05:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
because the Federal Supply schedule
 
05:15:44.350 --> 05:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
which is only allowed to be accessed is
 
05:15:46.470 --> 05:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
by governmental AG entities so therefore
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
if you're private Enterprise you cannot
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
get the Federal Supply schedule which is
 
05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
a significant savings to the state to
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and to pay parents
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
collectively so when you think of it
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
that ways it's a passive vaccine it's
 
05:16:00.110 --> 05:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
still a vaccine number two it's one of
 
05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
those things allow for the state to
 
05:16:06.030 --> 05:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
allow them to obtain it to distribute to
 
05:16:10.270 --> 05:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
the providers at a much reduced price
 
05:16:10.280 --> 05:16:11.510 align:start position:0%
the providers at a much reduced price
representative

05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman
 
05:16:15.670 --> 05:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully passive vaccine is is
 
05:16:17.310 --> 05:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
totally antithetical to everything that
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
I've been taught there's active immunity
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's by natural introduction to an
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
antigen or there's um there's passive
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is through breastfeeding or um
 
05:16:29.628 --> 05:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
imunoglobulin but that is not a vaccine
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
a vaccine has always been defined as
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
introducing an antigen or or now we have
 
05:16:38.510 --> 05:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
the MRNA vaccines that create an immune
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
response after introducing an anen
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
anagen through a genetic process in the
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
cell but um the rabies vaccine there's a
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccine and then there's if you
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
get bit by an animal and you didn't have
 
05:16:52.628 --> 05:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
the rabies vaccine there's the rabies
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
IVIG that's not a vaccine um and and so
 
05:17:00.030 --> 05:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
even just expanding this you know beyond
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines it's it's Mission creep it's
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
total um you know we're just becoming
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
salese for for Pharma through the
 
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
government of New Hampshire and I think
 
05:17:12.030 --> 05:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
it's totally
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
inappropriate representative Missour
 
05:17:18.430 --> 05:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
thank you can I ask a question so are
 
05:17:20.548 --> 05:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
children under the Medicaid Program are
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
they not getting this shot for free
 
05:17:22.440 --> 05:17:23.350 align:start position:0%
they not getting this shot for free
right

05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
now under the under the Medicaid Program
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
right now that I can't say I'll talk to
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
someone from the Department my
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is Medicaid covers most of
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccines probably this one here it's
 
05:17:36.150 --> 05:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
more in the commercial side I but as far
 
05:17:39.270 --> 05:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
as I know commercially insured children
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is this shot is covered is covered
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
for them as well that I don't know I
 
05:17:47.310 --> 05:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
mean I can can somebody looked into it
 
05:17:48.910 --> 05:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
and most do
 
05:17:52.030 --> 05:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
so can we call I don't Department
 
05:17:54.110 --> 05:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
somebody he to speak on that did you
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
have information on this or well I was
 
05:17:58.750 --> 05:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
going to raise the issue of people who
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't have any insurance at all and uh
 
05:18:05.990 --> 05:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
secondarily I would raise the point that
 
05:18:06.000 --> 05:18:07.430 align:start position:0%
secondarily I would raise the point that
uh

05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:09.548 --> 05:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
05:18:09.558 --> 05:18:10.750 align:start position:0%
participating in
the

05:18:10.750 --> 05:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:15.150 --> 05:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine um Association reduces the cost
 
05:18:17.150 --> 05:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
measurably for
 
05:18:20.350 --> 05:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
everybody so that's just my
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
comment M Rogers cares to answer the
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.628 --> 05:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
it thank you Abby Rogers legislative
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
leaon um just to clarify that the
 
05:18:38.310 --> 05:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid population does receive the
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
vaccin free of cost or and it is an
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
immunization technically it is an
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
immunization uh and that's why we had to
 
05:18:47.708 --> 05:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
change the uh originally in the Bell we
 
05:18:49.350 --> 05:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
were trying to change the definition to
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
include this product but it's not
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
included under the definition of
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination as an immunization or
 
05:18:57.830 --> 05:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine like product um the commercially
 
05:18:59.670 --> 05:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
insured this is this bill is trying to
 
05:19:02.150 --> 05:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
fix that technical fix so so the payers
 
05:19:03.910 --> 05:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh the carriers can assess and pay for
 
05:19:07.708 --> 05:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
this product um and it is I think the
 
05:19:09.230 --> 05:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
testimony of the carrier carriers where
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
that uh patients can patients parents
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
can provide can pay out of pocket for
 
05:19:17.150 --> 05:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
this at the cost of $495 if they needed
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
to get it but because this um payer
 
05:19:23.190 --> 05:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism is is not uh there there's no
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
definition of biological product or this
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
new monoclonal in the in the bill so
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
right now that this would fix that so
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers would be able to
 
05:19:34.030 --> 05:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
assess and pay for the
 
05:19:36.708 --> 05:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
direct any questions for rep M Miss
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
Rogers representative Weber
 
05:19:42.110 --> 05:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
do you have any indication that would
 
05:19:45.470 --> 05:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
give you any idea of the savings uh to
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
the state through the Medicaid Program
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
if you don't that's fine I just wondered
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh through through the for RSV for
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations as a result of not
 
05:19:57.670 --> 05:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
having the immunization no to to the
 
05:19:57.680 --> 05:19:59.030 align:start position:0%
having the immunization no to to the
cost

05:19:59.030 --> 05:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:20:01.470 --> 05:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
of because I assume that the patients
 
05:20:02.628 --> 05:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
who get
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid do they participate in the
 
05:20:09.150 --> 05:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine yes it's well it's yes exactly
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
so it's free of charge it the state
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
would purchase the vaccine or or get
 
05:20:17.390 --> 05:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
into the association at a lower price
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you could tell me
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
what the price differential was if you
 
05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that's fine I can estimate
 
05:20:24.270 --> 05:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
that it's probably if you were to pay
 
05:20:26.830 --> 05:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
for it it would be $495 it's about $100
 
05:20:29.470 --> 05:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
a vaccine cost savings so it's if a
 
05:20:31.868 --> 05:20:31.878 align:start position:0%
provider order is it it's about
 
05:20:33.910 --> 05:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
$3995 if he ordered it through the
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
program versus outside the program so it
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
would save the state $100 do per
 
05:20:41.788 --> 05:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
immunization yes per immunization thank
 
05:20:43.708 --> 05:20:43.718 align:start position:0%
you sure representative Lon and then
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
representative kosman uh thank you Mr
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um I guess this isn't
 
05:20:48.788 --> 05:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
specifically a question but you may have
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
some insight in there um looking at this
 
05:20:53.708 --> 05:20:53.718 align:start position:0%
this is a good example about some of the
 
05:20:55.548 --> 05:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
way that medicine and everything else
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
has shifted uh previously a lot of
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
getting new products out there has been
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of reaching out to Providers and
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
then insurers in order to get things
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
adopted um there's been a move over the
 
05:21:08.230 --> 05:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
last decade or so and an even bigger
 
05:21:10.708 --> 05:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
move um in the last few years to have
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
things included in state payment because
 
05:21:15.030 --> 05:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier it's a pain to deal
 
05:21:16.750 --> 05:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
with us but it's a lot easier to deal
 
05:21:18.270 --> 05:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
with us than it is to deal with a whole
 
05:21:19.910 --> 05:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of insurers and a whole bunch of
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
providers so making it so that states
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
cover the payment makes it easier for
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
the companies to bring the drugs and it
 
05:21:29.628 --> 05:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
also makes it easier for them to charge
 
05:21:32.270 --> 05:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
more money for the drugs so um when you
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
look at the different business models of
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
it the business model of bringing
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
something in especially if it's a high
 
05:21:39.470 --> 05:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
cost if it's not adopted by the state
 
05:21:40.948 --> 05:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
and then a lower cost where your
 
05:21:42.788 --> 05:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
guaranteed sales to every child in the
 
05:21:45.510 --> 05:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
state is a business model um and that's
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
not a business model that I'm
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
comfortable with um I don't like having
 
05:21:50.990 --> 05:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
the state um be involved in increasing
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
products even if the marginal use use
 
05:21:55.788 --> 05:21:55.798 align:start position:0%
cost is lower guaranteeing every every
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
child in the state or the country or the
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
world gets it even at a lower price
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
ensures greater profits for fortical
 
05:22:06.190 --> 05:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
companies and um the move to profiting
 
05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
off vaccines as opposed to providing
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
them them just as something that they
 
05:22:13.110 --> 05:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
provide with enough to cover the cost
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the losses that happen from it is
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things one of the big areas
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
where I have problems with Pharma while
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
I don't have problems in a lot of the
 
05:22:24.190 --> 05:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:27.230 --> 05:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
do uh representative kushman thank you
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um can you tell me isn't it
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
true that the cost for the vaccines that
 
05:22:37.948 --> 05:22:37.958 align:start position:0%
are purchased by the vaccine Association
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
is made up for with increases in the um
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
in the insurance cost for private
 
05:22:45.718 --> 05:22:46.788 align:start position:0%
in the insurance cost for private
insured

05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
insured
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
persons I'm sorry I wish Patrick Miller
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine Association was here to
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
answer that I don't I don't I could get
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
back to you certainly with that to
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
answer to your question um I can tell
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
you that it is in RSA 126q colon one
 
05:23:03.070 --> 05:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
assessments means the accessible
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
entities liability with respect to
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Childhood vaccines determined in
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
accordance with this chapter for purpose
 
05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
of rate setting and medical loss ratio
 
05:23:13.230 --> 05:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
calculations all Associated Association
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
assessments are considered
 
05:23:15.948 --> 05:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical or medical benefit costs
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
and not regulatory costs so they are um
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
bringing that
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
into um
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
the uh administrative costs that then
 
05:23:31.150 --> 05:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
transfer over to the private sector
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
Insurance um I'm sorry I can probably
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
get that to you offline or have Patrick
 
05:23:38.190 --> 05:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
Miller reach out to you to clarify that
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's under the statute that he
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
works with but thank you thank you sure
 
05:23:41.718 --> 05:23:43.110 align:start position:0%

ready I'll ask him to call I'm sorry
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
representative Paz off uh uh there are
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
several reasons why uh I oppose uh uh
 
05:26:01.830 --> 05:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
this expansion of New Hampshire vaccine
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
Association uh mandate uh in previous
 
05:26:09.150 --> 05:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
discussion it it was not quite clear
 
05:26:11.948 --> 05:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
why we would uh oppose it but at the
 
05:26:15.788 --> 05:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
very minimum we would want uh this be
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
efficient we would want it to be
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
transparent and to be able to follow
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
current uh statute so with efficient we
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
briefly uh talk uh about Administration
 
05:26:33.868 --> 05:26:33.878 align:start position:0%
so what what the cost of administration
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
overhead you wouldn't be able to find it
 
05:26:39.628 --> 05:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
because it's hidden in medical expenses
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
so we can't say um Administration cost
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
or vaccine waste uh it's always a huge
 
05:26:51.310 --> 05:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
issue uh with vaccines when they expire
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
or such uh so we we don't have a dollar
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
number uh how much uh it costs uh in uh
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
under procurement uh under this
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
procurement agent uh uh uh how much
 
05:27:09.788 --> 05:27:09.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine waste uh course so we can not
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
say how efficient uh there are issues
 
05:27:18.190 --> 05:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
with transparency uh uh Zoom meetings uh
 
05:27:22.110 --> 05:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
video of Zoom meetings are not released
 
05:27:27.390 --> 05:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh people are not able people kind of
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
able to ask them questions but people
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
are not getting answers and then just uh
 
05:27:37.270 --> 05:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
recently there was a issue with vaccine
 
05:27:39.628 --> 05:27:39.638 align:start position:0%
Association change their minutes to
 
05:27:43.868 --> 05:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
remove a question they didn't like and
 
05:27:43.878 --> 05:27:44.708 align:start position:0%
remove a question they didn't like and
with

05:27:44.708 --> 05:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
statues so they without
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh without our authorization vaccine
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
Association started procuring uh
 
05:27:58.350 --> 05:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines uh and uh we
 
05:28:00.750 --> 05:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
authorized vaccine Association to
 
05:28:03.310 --> 05:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
procure three types of
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh so first type of vaccine
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's under RSA 12 6 Q column one uh
 
05:28:15.190 --> 05:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
definition of vaccine so first kind any
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
preparation of killed
 
05:28:20.470 --> 05:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
microorganisms it's not a covid vaccine
 
05:28:20.480 --> 05:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
microorganisms it's not a covid vaccine
uh

05:28:21.190 --> 05:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
type second living attenuated organisms
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine is not living organisms
 
05:28:33.990 --> 05:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
third type living fully viral viral and
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
organisms definitely not a covid vaccine
 
05:28:39.868 --> 05:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
so covid vaccine was not authorized by
 
05:28:44.788 --> 05:28:44.798 align:start position:0%
this body and yet vaccine Association is
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why why they doing it
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
but definitely uh when this question
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
arised uh they were not comfortable with
 
05:28:56.110 --> 05:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
it so they removed it from their minute
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
the question about this so I'm not
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh uh giving them even
 
05:29:03.360 --> 05:29:05.110 align:start position:0%
comfortable with uh uh giving them even
more

05:29:05.110 --> 05:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:29:08.470 --> 05:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
Authority uh because I don't see it as
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
efficient transparent and following
 
05:29:13.150 --> 05:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
statutes thank you thank you now
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative McLean and then
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative pmer thank you Mr chair
 
05:29:19.548 --> 05:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm I'm actually kind of
 
05:29:23.310 --> 05:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
excited about the potential of um the
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
Biologicals and I'm excited about the
 
05:29:30.868 --> 05:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
RSD vaccine um and I I'm kind of this
 
05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
close to voting for 559 but I can't and
 
05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know and I kind of talk with
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant a little bit
 
05:29:42.750 --> 05:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
about this but for me had this bill come
 
05:29:45.788 --> 05:29:45.798 align:start position:0%
unamended in 2004 it would have passed
 
05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
out of this committee 20 to nothing it
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
would have went on the the consent
 
05:29:53.628 --> 05:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
calendar but you know unfortunately what
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
happened since then is we did have the
 
05:29:59.708 --> 05:29:59.718 align:start position:0%
whole covid pandemic happen in the
 
05:30:02.910 --> 05:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
middle and so my email and my phone is
 
05:30:05.788 --> 05:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
blowing up with people in in opposition
 
05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
to this thing and and the reason I think
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
for that is because prior to the
 
05:30:13.510 --> 05:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic there was a fringe group that
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
was maybe
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
antivaxx um but the way the whole covid
 
05:30:22.030 --> 05:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
thing happened trust has totally been
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
eroded um and so I think for the next
 
05:30:27.670 --> 05:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
probably 10 years every time we bring
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
forth the vaccine bill it's going to be
 
05:30:33.270 --> 05:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
a very very difficult discussion and so
 
05:30:34.390 --> 05:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that I
 
05:30:37.070 --> 05:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
appreciated about this amendment is it
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
understands that the we're going to go
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
to reestablishing that trust which we
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
need to do because we can't be
 
05:30:44.948 --> 05:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
constantly fighting with the people over
 
05:30:46.910 --> 05:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines we got to reestablish that
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
trust this goes and it takes you know a
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
nice bite at the Apple and it doesn't go
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
whole hog and try to eat the whole thing
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
but I still don't think it's ready and
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
the reason that I don't think it's ready
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
is because when I was listening to the
 
05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
public hearing there were two concerns
 
05:31:06.510 --> 05:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
for me number one was you know the
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
efficacy data we're still kind of
 
05:31:11.310 --> 05:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
waiting on that and then uh Miss Condon
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the liability
 
05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
concerns and the federal language um is
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
not yet written to incorporate um the
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
Biologicals now we heard subsequent
 
05:31:28.150 --> 05:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um that that language at the
 
05:31:31.750 --> 05:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
federal level is being Rewritten um
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
because but if if if the if the New
 
05:31:35.708 --> 05:31:35.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire vaccine Association is going
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
to be supplying that in advance of
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
having that immunity that does open us
 
05:31:45.708 --> 05:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
up to concern so I I really believe that
 
05:31:48.150 --> 05:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know this this we should go on pause
 
05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill let the efficacy data
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
come forward let the federal liability
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
language be Rewritten in fact and and
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
not in potential and then we can come
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
back and as I said representative
 
05:32:04.510 --> 05:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant I think this approach is the
 
05:32:05.910 --> 05:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
approach that we're going to have to
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
take going forward because I mean the
 
05:32:09.948 --> 05:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
people who are calling me and emailing
 
05:32:12.110 --> 05:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
me these are not a bunch of nut bags
 
05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
okay this these are these these are my
 
05:32:17.230 --> 05:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
constituency and and they just they've
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of trust this I think is the
 
05:32:20.788 --> 05:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
right way but I still think there's some
 
05:32:22.590 --> 05:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
more work we have to do before we can
 
05:32:24.390 --> 05:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
bring it forward so that's kind of where
 
05:32:26.670 --> 05:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
I am with it and I love the amendment
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
but I can't support the LA
 
05:32:28.240 --> 05:32:31.030 align:start position:0%
but I can't support the LA
representative

05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:34.270 --> 05:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
Palmer so I do appreciate the comment
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
about the constituents my the the
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
constituents that have emailed me or all
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
for this bill yeah um and the reason I'm
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to vote for it is 50 to 880,000
 
05:32:48.990 --> 05:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
kids under five being hospitalized and
 
05:32:50.390 --> 05:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
the parents have the choice of whether
 
05:32:52.830 --> 05:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
or not to do this and for the people who
 
05:32:55.628 --> 05:32:55.638 align:start position:0%
can't afford it I I would want to
 
05:32:55.638 --> 05:32:56.548 align:start position:0%
can't afford it I I would want to
support

05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
them other discussion representative
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
Weber I just wanted to say that I I I'm
 
05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and for a great
 
05:33:08.510 --> 05:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
number of my constituents who also say
 
05:33:12.030 --> 05:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
that this is uh that are very much Pro
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines very much Pro this vaccine and
 
05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
very much Pro this program so while
 
05:33:23.150 --> 05:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
there are people reasonable people who
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
have lost trust who are
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
questioning they have the ability to
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
make their own choices about what
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with it but I think
 
05:33:36.910 --> 05:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
this is a great program and overall as
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
the daughter of a polio Survivor I can't
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
tell you how Prov vaccine I am and how
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
grateful I am for the progression of
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
science as things go forward so that's
 
05:33:51.628 --> 05:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
just a personal
 
05:33:54.670 --> 05:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
statement representative Merchant thank
 
05:33:57.190 --> 05:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
you a couple of questions in regards to
 
05:33:59.110 --> 05:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
the liability issue my understanding is
 
05:34:01.110 --> 05:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
that the reason why we had the vaccine
 
05:34:03.548 --> 05:34:03.558 align:start position:0%
liability was because manufacturers were
 
05:34:05.470 --> 05:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
no longer going to make vaccines in
 
05:34:07.548 --> 05:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
general because there was such exposure
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
like liability wise in the government at
 
05:34:10.830 --> 05:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
that point in time stepped in to create
 
05:34:13.548 --> 05:34:13.558 align:start position:0%
a pot for them to cover the liability
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
this truck today is not under that
 
05:34:17.670 --> 05:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
program hopefully it may come that way
 
05:34:20.590 --> 05:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
but because the manufacturers releasing
 
05:34:22.510 --> 05:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
the product today they're responsible
 
05:34:24.110 --> 05:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
they have the liability now there not
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
the federal government it's they it's on
 
05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
them so they're the ones that have to
 
05:34:30.310 --> 05:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
pick up the liability number two I would
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
say in regards to the um the issue I
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a
 
05:34:39.310 --> 05:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
correction um I I inadvertently confused
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
myself in my notes um rabus vaccine is a
 
05:34:43.910 --> 05:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine rabus immun gabin is immun gabin
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's not passive so I did speak
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
incorrectly I wanted to CL clarify that
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
with everybody in the committee um this
 
05:34:54.910 --> 05:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
is kind of the first RSV vaccine coming
 
05:34:57.548 --> 05:34:57.558 align:start position:0%
this way as a monoclonal antibody the
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
other ones are IVIG and some of the
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
things you talked about before
 
05:35:01.990 --> 05:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
representment so I wanted to clarify
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
that with the committee and not have um
 
05:35:08.030 --> 05:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
I representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
05:35:12.190 --> 05:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and I will be brief um I
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
remember years ago being at an investor
 
05:35:16.030 --> 05:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
Focus vaccine conference talking about
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
the ways to make uh more availability um
 
05:35:20.430 --> 05:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
they included things like adding more
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
things to the childhood schedule um so
 
05:35:24.510 --> 05:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
that prepared we would be prepared for a
 
05:35:26.590 --> 05:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic and doing things like getting
 
05:35:29.310 --> 05:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
all all vaccines paid for in the United
 
05:35:31.670 --> 05:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
States to subsidize the cost both in the
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
United States and worldwide um I I
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that they brought forward
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
this RSV um and I appreciate that it's
 
05:35:40.830 --> 05:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
out there but I'm not in the business of
 
05:35:43.110 --> 05:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
subsidizing anybody especially not big
 
05:35:45.070 --> 05:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
Pharma so I'm sorry I but I won't be
 
05:35:46.750 --> 05:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
able to support
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
this representative Missour just um you
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
know big circle in my notes that 106
 
05:35:56.750 --> 05:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
people were against this online when
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
when during the hearing so that speaks
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
volumes to me too so yes I voted for the
 
05:36:04.708 --> 05:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
amendment um absolutely will not be
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
