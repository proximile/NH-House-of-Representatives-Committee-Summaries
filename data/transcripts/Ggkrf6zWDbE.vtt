00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay seeing that it is 10 30 a.m i'm
 
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to call to order the uh
 
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session for house bill
 
00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 align:start position:0%
hb 1454 fn
 
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
uh and with that i don't have a gavel
 
00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
but i'll just use my hands so we'll open
 
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work session
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
just to briefly talk about where we were
 
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
last week we had some
 
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
conversation around potential changes
 
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
and tweaks and language
 
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
we heard from representative tucker
 
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
and director wimsat a little bit about
 
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
some of the varying geological
 
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.030 align:start position:0%
some of the varying geological
structures

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
structures
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and with that i'd
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
like to briefly open
 
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
and allow representative tucker to come
 
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward and just give us an update with
 
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
any changes she may have had and then
 
00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:33.910 align:start position:0%
any changes she may have had and then
i'll

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
open the floor to the subcommittee work
 
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
group members to continue um
 
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
yours

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
for being here today
 
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
for being here today
uh

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
i really don't have much to add uh
 
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
various members of the committee
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
your committee have been working
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
and some last minute thoughts of coming
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
up so i think that things are still
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
bubbling along as people try to get this
 
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
just right on my way down here i stopped
 
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
in the town of carroll which i represent
 
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
made up of twin mountain and
 
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
bretton woods
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
and saw that last year at their timing
 
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
they voted 202 to 75
 
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
against having a landfill in dalton
 
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
at their town meeting
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
they discuss it
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
previous to that meeting
 
00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
the town of whitefield did the same but
 
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
the previous year by a much more
 
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
the previous year by a much more
overwhelming

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelming
 
00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
margin and i wanted to bring that up
 
00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
margin and i wanted to bring that up
because

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's good to know that people
 
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
who live in the area
 
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
where there's a current
 
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.790 align:start position:0%
where there's a current
pending

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
pending
 
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
partial application
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
do have opinions on the topic
 
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
do have opinions on the topic
and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
really i'm eager to hear what you have
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
to say i'm eager to get something in the
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
hands of
 
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
hands of
ols

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
ols
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
so they can move forward so i thank you
 
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.589 align:start position:0%
so they can move forward so i thank you
enormously

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
enormously
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker i am
 
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
going to also let the folks um and the
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
public know that there are copies of
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
proposed language um
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
as presented by representative bixby i
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
think they're at the end of the table
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
here if you'd like to grab them feel
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
free to do so
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm going to
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
open it up for discussion among the
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.909 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
uh

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
actually and representative bixby in my
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
error may i pause for a moment
 
00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
error may i pause for a moment
okay

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure that i also
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
recognized that there is a member of the
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
actual subcommittee work group who had a
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
thought in my apologies to the member so
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
just one but go ahead okay so um so the
 
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.469 align:start position:0%
just one but go ahead okay so um so the
uh

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
the pre so that the first sentence
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
basically says why this uh
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
uh why this piece of legislation is in
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
the public interest and
 
00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.110 align:start position:0%
the public interest and
uh

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
emphasizes that
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
preventing that it's really about
 
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
preventing that it's really about
preventing

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
contamination from reaching the
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
perennial water bodies
 
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.189 align:start position:0%
perennial water bodies
uh

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then a period of five years should
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to detect and map a
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
failure assess appropriate remediation
 
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
meet engineering and regulatory
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
requirements and initiate a remedy uh
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i see i spelled it misspelled
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
initiate there but that's something we
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
can do in drafting um
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.189 align:start position:0%
so uh
the

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that basically
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
sets the framework for
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
what follows and then what follows is
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh what we uh were
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
discussing last week
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i have removed from the middle of
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
the fir of the next paragraph
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
the words any leaks bill or other
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
failure because that uh
 
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.550 align:start position:0%
failure because that uh
was

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
a cause of confusion for people reading
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
it and we certainly don't want
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
so this basically sets out uh
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
the policy of uh you know how how this
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
is um how this goes together and then
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph b
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
sets out uh
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
basically how the policy will be
 
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.350 align:start position:0%
basically how the policy will be
implemented

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.189 align:start position:0%
uh so
the

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental idea behind this is that
 
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.029 align:start position:0%
fundamental idea behind this is that
before

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to
 
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
cite a landfill
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
if they do this assessment and figure
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
out that yes
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a viable sort of site
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
based on hydrogeology then it makes
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
sense for them to go forward if they
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
discover that
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
that their
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
intended site may fail this test then
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
they having done this at the very
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
beginning they will realize that this is
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
not a good place to sign a landfill and
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
they can look for look elsewhere
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
so that that's the basic idea here
 
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.510 align:start position:0%
so that that's the basic idea here
so

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
well i guess uh representative compton
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
had some thoughts please
 
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
had some thoughts please
representative

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i do have some
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
questions and a couple of concerns
 
00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:23.749 align:start position:0%
questions and a couple of concerns
um

00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i guess my first question will be
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.190 align:start position:0%
 
currently

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
how many public landfills do we have in
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire that accepts
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
from other towns i guess is the question
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
because you have local
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
landfill sites that only accept from
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
their town but then you have the ones
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
that accept from other towns that don't
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
have a landfill site
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
right right now we have only three
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
municipally owned landfills that are
 
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
municipally owned landfills that are
operating

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.550 align:start position:0%
operating
nashua

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
just takes from nashua
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
lebanon takes from a limited service
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
area that includes about uh
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know eight or ten
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
towns in the area of lebanon in new
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and another
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
maybe eight or ten towns in vermont so
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
they have the limited service area but
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
they do take about waste from about 20
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
towns both in new hampshire and vermont
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then the mount washington um
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
valley landfill in conway
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i they take from conway north conway
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
i believe they may be albany and a
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
couple of other towns so there are a few
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
other but again a limited service area
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's always a great category so the
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
anderson valley regional refuge disposal
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
district owns and operates the mount
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
carvery landfill and success
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
so that's not maybe technically a
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
municipally owned landfill but it's a
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
publicly owned landfill it's owned by a
 
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.030 align:start position:0%
publicly owned landfill it's owned by a
district

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
and they operate commercially and they
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
have an unlimited service area so they
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
accept waste from
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
all over new hampshire um and
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
massachusetts maine and uh and vermont
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
and and they could they couldn't take
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
waste from anywhere
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
anywhere they'd like they have unlimited
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
service area
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
um are there any other public landfills
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
um in new hampshire i mean is there one
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
in rochester i believe and that's not a
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
public landfill the rochester landfill
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
is owned by waste management in new
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's called the turnkey
 
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's called the turnkey
landfill

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that is a commercially operated
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
landfill that accepts waste from from
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
with an unlimited service area
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
and then the uh to round it out uh
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
what's the only one i haven't mentioned
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
is the ncs landfill in bethlehem which
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
is also a privately owned commercially
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
operated landfill with an unlimited
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
service area
 
00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:49.910 align:start position:0%
service area
um

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and and
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%

or

or
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
landfills which is mount carbury turnkey
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the ncs in bethlehem
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
what is the life expectancy on each of
 
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
what is the life expectancy on each of
those

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
the current permitted capacity
 
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.190 align:start position:0%
the current permitted capacity
in

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
rochester at the turnkey landfill they
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
are permitted to operate through 2034.
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
the nces landfill is currently permitted
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
to operate through 2026
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
and the mount carberry landfill is
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
currently uh permitted i believe to
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
operate through 2025.
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
i should note that any one of those
 
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
i should note that any one of those
landfills

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
submit a permit an application for a
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
permit to expand the facility and in
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
fact we do have a currently pending
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
application for mount carberry landfill
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
and success
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
to expand their landfill
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
i guess the uh what i would also note in
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
the case of ncs in bethlehem it is my
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
due to local zoning that limits where in
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
the town a landfill can be located
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um they do not have a need
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
they would not they're not in a position
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
to expand the footprint of their
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
landfill beyond the permanent capacity
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sorry one more question
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
with the um it looks like the turnkey in
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
the ncs
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um landfill is coming to an end one in
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
four years
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh the other one in 12.
 
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.670 align:start position:0%
uh the other one in 12.
um

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
what impact will that have on the state
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh and and the uh
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
constituents of new hampshire and how
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
will it affect uh could possibly i know
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
you probably can't answer this but how
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
will it possibly affect their property
 
00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:16.470 align:start position:0%
will it possibly affect their property
taxes

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
sure thanks uh sorry so and
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
ncs it sounds like it doesn't have any
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
options based on their footprint is what
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of understanding from you and i
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
mean and this is subjective so it's not
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
a hard fast rule how will that affect
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
the towns that
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
bring their waste
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
and if they were to go to mount carbury
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
or turnkey
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
would that affect
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
their ability to
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
even though mount carbury has been just
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
approved to expand
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
would that probably
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
decrease the time
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
that they have um
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
it shut me off it was tired of listening
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
it happens a lot um
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.990 align:start position:0%
so the uh
um

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
mount carburyland i'm sorry could you
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
repeat the question again
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
if ncs were to close because based on
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
the what you the information you just
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed to us with the zoning
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
ordinance and stuff
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
how if those uh towns that are bringing
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
their waste to
 
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.430 align:start position:0%
their waste to
ncs

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
ncs
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
and they had to find an alternative
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
which would probably be mount carbury or
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
the turnkey
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
how will would that affect their
 
00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.670 align:start position:0%
how will would that affect their
capacity

00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
i know that mount harbor you said just
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
expand get an expansion
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
not knowing you know
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
do you want you understand what i'm
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
saying so i do yeah thank you for
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
repeating that uh it's a somewhat
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
complicated question because the way we
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
permit landfill capacity in the state
 
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
permit landfill capacity in the state
we

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
must conduct a public benefit
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
determination to ensure that any
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
proposed expansion of an existing
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
landfill will provide a substantial
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
public benefit to the people of the
 
00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:27.030 align:start position:0%
public benefit to the people of the
state

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
and part of that and now a key part of
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
that analysis determining whether
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
there's a capacity shortfall that would
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
be satisfied by the landfill
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
when we permit these landfills if we if
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
we approve an expansion permit
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that the facility
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
provides a public benefit we specify a
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
particular number of years that the
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
landfill is to operate and provide
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
capacity for new hampshire waste
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
and typically we would put a
 
00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:56.230 align:start position:0%
and typically we would put a
total

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
tonnage limit per year how much waste
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
they could accept
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
in practice what often happens not
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily always so it depends on the
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
landfill and the decisions that the
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
operators of the landfill make about how
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
they want to run the landfill but in
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
practice what often happens is that
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
however much
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
in-state waste they take
 
00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.990 align:start position:0%
in-state waste they take
if

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
once they if they have excess capacity
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
beyond what is needed to provide for
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
that in-state waste disposal they will
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
often take waste from elsewhere from out
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that a landfill that
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
the landfill facilities that you
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
described would choose to operate by
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
using all their allotted capacity each
 
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.150 align:start position:0%
using all their allotted capacity each
year

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that um
 
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.470 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that um
uh

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
it would make any difference i guess so
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
so if what it would mean is so if if
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
suddenly there's more in-state waste
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
that knows that needs to go to that
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
landfill and the landfill operators
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
chose to use their maximum capacity for
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
they could take whatever is provided for
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
in-state and then the rest could be
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
supplemented without estate waste so it
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
may not have an actual impact on the
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
amount of capacity that's available year
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
to year
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
if they chose to
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
run at a rate lower than their annual
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity which we don't
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
typically see but it happens then it
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
i also have a question can we go back to
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
the permitting expansion footprint
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
conversation sure in addition to
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
a footprint that sounds like a
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
circumference footprint is that what i
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
mean the actual lateral extent of where
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
waste is actually placed on the land
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and um one other
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up if i may then um to what
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
extent is there an ability for someone
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
expansion yeah in landfills when they
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
seek a permit to expand they typically
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
seek both a footprint increase and a
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
vertical expansion there are certain
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
sort of engineering controlled and
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
geometric limitations on
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
if you've got a given footprint size on
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
how far you can go up vertically
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so so if your question is you know
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
can uh can a landfill just keep
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
expanding vertically without expanding
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
its permit no they're
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
without expanding its footprint no there
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
are there are limitations to that
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you director and i'm sorry oh
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's quite right i'm happy to answer
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
your questions um
 
00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
your questions um
so

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.789 align:start position:0%
so
if

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying based on
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
if i understand correctly
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.909 align:start position:0%
is that
the

00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
landfills the mount carbury and the
 
00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
landfills the mount carbury and the
turnkey

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
turnkey
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
if the ncs when it closes
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
would have to accept in-state refuse
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
before they can accept out of state
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
no that is not the case
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
we don't specify how much of each waste
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
kind of waste type they take
 
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.150 align:start position:0%
kind of waste type they take
um

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
we do require in order to find that
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's a substantial public benefit
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
that they do need to provide capacity
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
for in-state waste
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
but there's no sort of
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
numerical metric that specifies
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up um so if they decided i
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't know i like the number 100 it's
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
nice and easy so say they decided that
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
it would only take 60 percent of new
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire refuse and the rest was going
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
to be made up of 40 percent of out of
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
state and i'm assuming for dollar
 
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.549 align:start position:0%
state and i'm assuming for dollar
reasons

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
if there was excess new hampshire refuse
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
where would that go
 
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
where would that go
so

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
the expectation is that these facilities
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
in aggregate that are permitted here in
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
the state will be prepared to take
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
the waste that is generated in state
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
there there are some wastes that are
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
actually disposed of out of state for
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
private reasons that the generators that
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
waste make those decisions
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't ever like to speculate about
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
what the agency might do for enforcement
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
but obviously if
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
if a situation occurred where all the
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state were not
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
providing adequate capacity for in-state
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
generated waste
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
the agency could look at whether those
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
facilities were continuing to meet their
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
public benefit requirements and and take
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
some action but again that's not
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
something that we've encountered and i'm
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
hesitating to speculate what that might
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
look like
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.549 align:start position:0%
thank you um
so

00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
the geography of new hampshire bethlehem
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
um mount carberry and then ncs which is
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
over in the the coast
 
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.110 align:start position:0%
over in the the coast
um

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
with bethlehem closing
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
would that be added fees to get rid of
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
that waste if they had to go to
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
mount carvery or
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
the coast
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
i really couldn't say
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
whether the what the tipping fees would
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
be those are set by the individual
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
landfill operators and the agency
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any regulatory authority
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
over dipping fees
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton did you have a
 
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton did you have a
question

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's not relating to what you were
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
something was missing and um
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking in terms of groundwater
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water which is covered under
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
rsa 485
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
dash c
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
we've referenced here
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
surface waters as
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
and do we need to put in protections for
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
ground waters
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
under the 485-c
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
marshes and swamps that
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
are source waters for
 
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.149 align:start position:0%
are source waters for
creeks

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
creeks
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
brooks rivers and then maybe even
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
reservoirs as well as aquifers
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
that are not surface waters
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
but uh could be endangered by
 
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
but uh could be endangered by
contaminants

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i have not had a chance to look
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
further into 485-seat to see if there
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
are existing protections that relate to
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
but we need to maybe take a look at that
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
and coordinate those if there are not
 
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
and coordinate those if there are not
protections

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um director wimsack could you
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps speak to any of that
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
sure i'd be happy to so so you know
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
groundwater protection
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
when we permit a landfill
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
when we look at potential impacts
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
groundwater protection is one of the
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
primary things that we focus on and
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
indeed you've identified rsa45c
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
does provide us with authorities to
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
protect groundwater from a variety of
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
potential contamination sources
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
including landfills
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
and actually any permitted operating
 
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.950 align:start position:0%
and actually any permitted operating
landfill

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
is required to get a what's called a
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater release detection permit
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
which is a permit that is really
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
it prescribes a
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
network of monitoring wells that need to
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
be installed immediately surrounding the
 
00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
be installed immediately surrounding the
facility

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
background information obtained about uh
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know upgrading groundwater quality
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
so that potential impacts from the
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
landfill can be assessed relative to the
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
existing groundwater quality
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
regular monitoring is required
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the life and the post-closure
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
period of the landfill
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it's not adversely
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
impacting groundwater so there's a very
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
robust system for doing that multiple
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
times a year those wells are sampled
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
and in the event that um
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
any um
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
contaminant a concern is
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
detected above background that triggers
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
an assessment monitoring period where
 
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
an assessment monitoring period where
increased

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
uh more frequent some of his more
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
frequent and and and an
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
analysis for a larger suite of
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
contaminants is required to identify the
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
source of the problem and then once it's
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
identified to fix it so there is already
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
a robust
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
system for protecting groundwater around
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
our operating landfills
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.470 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
should we still
 
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
make reference not only to the surface
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
waters but to the ground waters
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the 485 section as well as the
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
483 section to make the bill
 
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
483 section to make the bill
um

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
clear for coverage and
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
just make that linkage is that advisable
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
in this bill i couldn't advise on that i
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
do want to remind the committee members
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
that the agency is not taking a position
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
on this bill we're happy to answer
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
questions about the law and the current
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
status of how we regulate solid waste
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
facilities but we're really not trying
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
to to weigh in on the content or the
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative coumtois
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair thank you director
 
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.669 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair thank you director
um

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
based on the current guidelines
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
that des is using um do you feel
 
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.549 align:start position:0%
that des is using um do you feel
currently

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:45.669 align:start position:0%
currently
that

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
your the regulations in place are
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
protecting groundwater and drinking
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
water based on
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
what is in place now
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that you know we focus
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
primarily on groundwater because that
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater is right there immediately
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
at the facility underlies the landfill
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's immediately you know it's
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the in the formation
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
and so i think that the protections and
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
the monitoring
 
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.750 align:start position:0%
associated with
um

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater are are very protective and
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
they work very effectively
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to surface water um
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're not again taking a position on
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
this bill i i have said to this to the
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
full committee before that
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
we do that's not to say that we don't
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
how surface waters are regulated and
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
protected under the statute isn't an
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing for the legislature to
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
be discussing we absolutely believe it
 
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.310 align:start position:0%
be discussing we absolutely believe it
is

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
but because this bill and its efforts
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
could potentially have an impact on a
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
application that's currently pending
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
before the agency
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
it puts us in a position where it's
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
really not appropriate for us to take a
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton and then
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
for for my own curiosity um
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
do surface waters and ground waters
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
have an interplay and interconnection
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
does one feed the other or
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
or lead into the other vice versa um
 
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.149 align:start position:0%
or lead into the other vice versa um
just

00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
question about hydraulic hydrology in
 
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.430 align:start position:0%
question about hydraulic hydrology in
general

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely there's no question that in
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
general surface water and groundwater
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
are intimately connected and one of the
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
each one effects can potentially affect
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
the other in the given circumstance
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah uh i just want
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.750 align:start position:0%
to um
uh

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that the uh
 
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.110 align:start position:0%
make sure that the uh
just

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the intent of this particular piece
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
is to um just address the existing um
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
or update the existing setback from
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
surface waters
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
which is currently set at um
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
200 feet no matter what the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
geology and the hydrogeology look like
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
and it is um
 
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.950 align:start position:0%
and it is um
so

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.070 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
would it create confusion
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of that on setback from surface
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
water gold
 
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
water gold
to

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate something about aquifers or
 
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:31.029 align:start position:0%
incorporate something about aquifers or
marshes

00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
an aquifer is really referring to
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
groundwater and a marsh as i understand
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
it would really uh probably and again
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on this but but i
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
believe marshes would in many cases be
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
classified as surface waters okay and
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
so this is addressing surface waters as
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
defined in rsa
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
483 b4
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
would marshes be included in that
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm not sure i'm qualified to
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
answer that question we could okay so
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's something i'm sure there are
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
folks at des that could answer that
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
question but i'm not sure i'm one of
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
them okay and that's something we could
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
look up in terms of just look at that
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
rsa and just consume it
 
00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:17.029 align:start position:0%
rsa and just consume it
okay

00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative stapleton did you have
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.029 align:start position:0%
oh
great

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just a moment i think um so
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
if we're good with questions for
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
director windsot i'd like to open the
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
floor to other folks who would like to
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
weigh in um and if we have more
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions we'll call you up again

leave in a few minutes so if there are
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
further questions for me
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate if i could hear them
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
soon rather than later okay

[Music]
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
could you just
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
where are you from what

what company are you with in what
 
00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
what company are you with in what
landfill

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i'm with casella waste
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
management my name is john gay i'm an
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
engineer i've been with the company for
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
24 years and been in the industry for
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.509 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering uh
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
it looks like that yours is the first
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
landfill that's getting ready to come to
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
the end of its life cycle and based on
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
what the director had to say there
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
may be no expansion possible for that
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
landfill is that correct
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
towns in new hampshire cities in new
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire does
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
your site serve
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
well we serve about 5 000 residents
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
across the state of new hampshire and
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
upwards of 50 businesses
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
do you take out-of-state waste also
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes we do um in 2021 i believe we took
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
about 14 of our total in
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
inbound waste was from out of state
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
about 84 was from new hampshire
 
00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
about 84 was from new hampshire
so

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
with this new proposed legislation
 
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.669 align:start position:0%
with this new proposed legislation
um

00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
would this have an impact on your
 
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:29.140 align:start position:0%
business or in your opinion
 
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.230 align:start position:0%
business or in your opinion

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
the impact to the 5 000 residents and 50
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
businesses in state that you service
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes i believe it would have an impact
 
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.789 align:start position:0%
yes i believe it would have an impact
so

00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
the customers that we
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
provide capacity for would need to find
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
capacity elsewhere
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the capacity that remains at the
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
other facilities that were mentioned
 
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.269 align:start position:0%
other facilities that were mentioned
earlier

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
one more yep thank you and and because
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask this this is a
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
subjective question um
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
but because you're in the industry um
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
with the closing of your landfill would
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
the tipping fees that the other
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
landfills possibly go higher because now
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
they're limited
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how it works
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be hard to say for me i
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
mean it would certainly be up to
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
the facilities that are accepting that
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
waste i
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
my professional opinion is that they
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't go up
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
but it's hard to say based on economics
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
and and what other changes might happen
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the in the waste industry
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
it does seem you know that that prices
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
are going up for everything these days
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.230 align:start position:0%
one more
and

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity
 
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.190 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity
if

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
your company were to look for another
 
00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:49.590 align:start position:0%
your company were to look for another
place

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
how long is the permitting process
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
usually uh from zero to
 
00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:57.509 align:start position:0%
usually uh from zero to
open

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.470 align:start position:0%
open
um

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just out of curiosity
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
i'd say it's zero to ten years um you
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
know by the time you you begin to look
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
at for a facility you perform the field
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
work uh
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
to assess the site uh permit the site
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.389 align:start position:0%
 
i years

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
i years
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think i saw a hand too from
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
can i uh representative bixby yes thank
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
director wimsett mentioned that uh as
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
part of the permitting process
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
you there's a
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
maximum tonnage that you're allowed to
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
accept yearly and that can be divided
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
between in-state and out-of-state waste
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
if the new state of new hampshire were
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
improve the diversion of uh
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
things like recyclables and organic
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
waste etc
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh would you
 
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
uh would you
then

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
fill up the rest of that tonnage with
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
more out of state waste
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
well so at north country we're permitted
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to accept 230 200 cubic yards
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
annually so that would there's a ceiling
 
00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
annually so that would there's a ceiling
there

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh if some of that capacity was lost
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know due to
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know any type of diversion you know
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
we would look to to back fill that
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
capacity for certain um
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
so yes i believe the answer is yes okay
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
i did have one additional question and
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not for you i'm not sure if
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
you are the design engineer or if or if
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
somebody else can speak to the
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
permitting process elsewhere in other
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
states that do have
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
hydro geological setbacks like some of
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
our neighbors have a six year setback
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
with hydrogeological
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
time of travel
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
how that might
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
how that works
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
if folks have sought permits in those
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
places and so
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i think based on my experience i
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
think uh the new england the northern
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
english states anyway
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh have all have similar uh rules uh
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
that consider setback uh requirements
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh in vermont it's 300 feet
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh to waters of the state uh here it's
 
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.109 align:start position:0%
uh to waters of the state uh here it's
200.

00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
200.
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
um but i think generally speaking uh the
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
rules are very consistent across across
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
the states at least that i have history
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
working within
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
including new york so
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
i think it is pretty consistent um
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
and certainly has been effective
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
so

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then there are some states that in
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
addition to a setback requirement do
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
have a time of travel consideration in
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
statute so can you speak to that
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
i i cannot speak to that i'm not sure
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
which which state you're referring to
 
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.589 align:start position:0%
which which state you're referring to
okay

00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have experience with
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
maine siding
 
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.910 align:start position:0%
maine siding
okay

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
um i would imagine that even before this
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill that there are that you have
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
in-house or you hire professional
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
hydrolysis to
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
really thoroughly examine the piece of
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
and they're measuring all of those
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
criteria that we're focusing on
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
how much permeability and travel
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
might be possible in the case of a
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
is that something that's already
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
well developed in engineering
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
in your company for looking at a new
 
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.550 align:start position:0%
in your company for looking at a new
site

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
or is it something brand new to you yeah
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
for sure i mean yeah yes we hire
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
consultants third-party
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
independent consultants um
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
who are professional hydrogeologists
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
that evaluate
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
the facility as i mentioned about 10
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
years to to
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
look at a site and then develop it to
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
the point where you can actually start
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking trash
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
in those early years the hydrogeologists
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
will go out put monitoring wells in
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
to understand the hydrogeology and the
 
00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:24.230 align:start position:0%
to understand the hydrogeology and the
geology

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
geology
 
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.829 align:start position:0%
geology
to

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
to give us information
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
so we can develop the footprint that we
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
spoke of earlier
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
so the site is well understood from a
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
hydro geological and geological
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint for certain it has to be
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
because the rules in new hampshire
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
require that
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
as mr wimzat mentioned
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
a ground water management release
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
detection permit
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that permit
 
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.710 align:start position:0%
and that permit
evaluates

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
evaluates
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
the siting for that particular facility
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
the groundwater movement the rate of
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
that movement
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and wells
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
can be added based on
 
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.470 align:start position:0%
can be added based on
uh

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
a proposal from the applicant
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
a review of the applicant's proposal by
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
the des
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
and then subsequent changes to that
 
00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
and then subsequent changes to that
proposal

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
to locate those wells in a in a manner
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
that can detect a release from from a
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
landfill now i think it's also important
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
to note that today's landfills are
 
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.190 align:start position:0%
to note that today's landfills are
double-lined

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
double-lined
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not like the landfills
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
from 30 years ago where there was no
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
containment system and and
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
and today we're still evaluating
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
contaminated groundwater based on some
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
older facilities today's landfills are
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
double lined there's a system
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
in place to capture a leak through the
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
primary system if one was to exist
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
and then eventually if anything was to
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
that is what we're talking about with
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
the groundwater management and release
 
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.630 align:start position:0%
the groundwater management and release
detection

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
detection
 
00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
detection
so

00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
if something was to breach the double
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
line landfill system uh the groundwater
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring network that was designed
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
based on the study done by the
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist and the review of the
 
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.990 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist and the review of the
state

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
would detect a release
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the direction that there
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
would likely be a release
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
and then remediation or corrective
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
action can be
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
implemented immediately to correct that
 
00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:28.550 align:start position:0%
implemented immediately to correct that
issue

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it you know this
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
system has worked very well for you know
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
30 years across the state of new
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire and beyond
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though there's quite
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
extensive study research um in in the
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
hydrology and the geology of a
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
prospective site
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
with that have you
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
looked at sites that look promising at
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
the outset but then later on with all of
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
the information come back
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
have you rejected sites or taken them
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
off the list
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes we have
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
and how how many roughly would that have
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
been say in the last 10 years
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
of searching for other locations
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
so we embarked upon a site-wide search
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
for for a replacement to our north
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
country facility in bethlehem i want to
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
say probably five or six years ago don't
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
hold me to that but it's been a while
 
00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:27.589 align:start position:0%
hold me to that but it's been a while
and

00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
we looked at five sites in particular
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know for further consideration and i
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
believe three of those were
 
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.150 align:start position:0%
believe three of those were
were

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
not as promising due to
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
the proximity to
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
a surface water of the state of new
 
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
a surface water of the state of new
hampshire

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions i know
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
that representative tucker had
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
had your hand up at one point did you
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
yes i i was very interested in
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
comments and i
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
knew that because we had a chat before
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
began that he was speaking about the
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
first line of the preamble
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
as to whether that should be adjusted to
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
including marshes or springs or
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
other water sources
 
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.550 align:start position:0%
other water sources
and

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a general comment it was very
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
specific as a thought should that should
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
these words be changed and i just
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
thought it would be
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
good for you to know how directed it was
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
at that
 
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.589 align:start position:0%
at that
preamble

00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
preamble
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
as a time saver to the discussion
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so i see that senator
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
hennessey is here i don't know whether
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
was there somebody else yes feel free to
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
for the record if you wouldn't mind
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
stating your name and where you're from
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
that would be great
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
my name is wayne morrison i'm a
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
homeowner in whitefield
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not an expert in
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
solid waste management but um in the
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
last several years being in
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
involved in kind of researching and
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
understanding this i've
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
i've been on a pretty steep learning
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
curve i just want to in hearing the
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
conversations about capacity that you
 
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:38.950 align:start position:0%
conversations about capacity that you
were

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
raising earlier i just wanted to
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate that this bill
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
really has nothing to do with
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
capacity it has nothing to do with
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
whether ncs closes or opens
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's really all about where you cite a
 
00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:52.710 align:start position:0%
it's really all about where you cite a
landfill

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the bill
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
is really all about using science
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh rather than an arbitrary distance
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
we've been operating for many years with
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
a 200-foot setback
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
which no none of us can figure out where
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
that came from or don't believe there's
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
any science behind it
 
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
any science behind it
and

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
so the intent of the bill is really to
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
figure out where we can safely put a
 
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.349 align:start position:0%
figure out where we can safely put a
landfill

00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is not about limiting landfills
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's not about
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
preventing landfills it's not about any
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
particular landfill it's about how we
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
operate in the state of new hampshire
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
and when and if we need additional
 
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.230 align:start position:0%
and when and if we need additional
capacity

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
how do we put it in a place that is
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
going to protect our waters and our
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
rivers and our lakes
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
and to do it safely
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
we were involved in a bill last year
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
that had to do with protecting our state
 
00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
that had to do with protecting our state
parks

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
parks
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
and we we offered up
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
a two-mile buffer
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the feedback that we got
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
both from the
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
house and the senate was about
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
trying to be more scientific about
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh that approach why two miles why not
 
00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.309 align:start position:0%
uh that approach why two miles why not
five

00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've done a bunch of research and um
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know this is a this bill is about
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
putting science behind where we should
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
cite landfills and how do we protect our
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
precious resources in the state
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
so um i just want to reiterate that
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's the essence of the bill and all
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
we want
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
is to make sure if and when the state
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
does cite a new landfill which by the
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
way hasn't as no one can really remember
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
the last time we did site a new landfill
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
we believe there's plenty of capacity
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the existing landfills and the
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
expansions that will happen but separate
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
from that if and
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
whenever we do decide that we do need
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
another landfill we want it to be cited
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
based on science and done in a location
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
that will protect our natural resources
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what this that's what this
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
all that this bill is intended to do
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i would i would ask the committee to
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
think of it in that regard
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:57.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
representatives

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
so do you think after looking at this
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill that it does adequately address the
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
need for scientific approach to location
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
with what we've covered in the bill so
 
00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
with what we've covered in the bill so
far

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
i do i think it's i think it's a great
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
step forward
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
i think if you look at other states
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's a number of other states that
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
have applied similar math in fact i
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
think somebody mentioned earlier that
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
maine in terms of new england is already
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
using this methodology i think they've
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually used six years so a little bit
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
more conservative
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
but there are other states also and
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
when when when you think about 200 feet
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
200 feet in some cases may be adequate
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
based on the hydrology of the site
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
in other cases it may be totally
 
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.550 align:start position:0%
in other cases it may be totally
inadequate

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i do know that you know i think
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
there was a comment made earlier that we
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
can we have monitoring wells and we can
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
quickly identify and resolve these
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
problems but the truth is
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
identifying the problem
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
coming up with a plan putting putting
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
mitigation in place rectifying the
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
problem that takes time
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the whole point of this bill is to
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
allowing us adequate time
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
to first detect the problem
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
and then resolve it before it hits any
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
of the waters that we're trying to
 
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.069 align:start position:0%
of the waters that we're trying to
protect

00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
and 200 feet does none of that
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
it it's it's it's it may be easy to
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
measure it may be it may be
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
intellectually very simple to process
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
but it can be totally ineffective in
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
what it's intended to do so
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity for us to make a
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
very substantial improvement in the way
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
we site and the setbacks that we put in
 
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
we site and the setbacks that we put in
landfills

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i think as a rational person
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
landfill landfills are
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the waste hierarchy for
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
a reason
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're complicated they're risky
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
they involve
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.430 align:start position:0%
you know
toxic

00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
toxic
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals that can be released into the
 
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.630 align:start position:0%
chemicals that can be released into the
environment

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
and this bill is an attempt
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
to realize that today we don't have
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
in some cases we it's the only solution
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
but we should do it in with the best
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
available knowledge that we have and
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to put science behind
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
where we cite them
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a it's a smart move for
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's a and it's a step
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the right direction about many things
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we have to do in the solid waste
 
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.150 align:start position:0%
that we have to do in the solid waste
business

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up
 
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
thank you follow-up
follow-up

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.349 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
would it seem like the
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
200 feet
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever is an old-time
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
supposition measure
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
akin almost are picking a number out of
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
a hat
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the scientific methods that
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
we have now and should be using for
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
citing landfills
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i wouldn't claim to know you know
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
the details of all that but it seems to
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
us that that was a arbitrary number that
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
was picked years and years ago
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we haven't made we haven't made any
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
changes to it we've continued to live
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
with that and we know a lot more now we
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
also recognize that things like pfas and
 
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.670 align:start position:0%
also recognize that things like pfas and
other

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know forever chemicals that we
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
didn't even know about years ago
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
they are much more prevalent and the
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
more we know the more we should be
 
00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.230 align:start position:0%
more we know the more we should be
concerned

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
and uh protecting our water today is you
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
know with the knowledge that we have is
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
ever more important than it ever was
 
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
ever more important than it ever was
before

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work group members i i did
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
have one other question um and thank you
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
for indulging me for the moment um
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to see how um
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
working in other states have you
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
spoken with
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has
 
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
anybody else who has
similar

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
in your community concerns or
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
what what are you
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
um as far as the setback as far what are
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
you noticing are you noticing a trend
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
with the desires
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
to have this change or can you speak a
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
little bit more about that
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
well i would go back to my frame of
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
reference is you know i i got involved
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
in this um we got a lot of feedback that
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know the setback requirements that
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
we wanted to change should really be
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
based on science
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
so we went off and we talked to
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
scientists and we did some research and
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
part of that research was to look at
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
other states and i think if you if if
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
you do some research you'll find that
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
i know six or eight or ten states have
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
some form of or some version of
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:43.990 align:start position:0%
of this bill
and

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about um the way we we not not
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
just this particular element of our
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan but we have a lot of
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
legacy uh rules and regulations that
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
have been around for a lot of years
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
um mr wimsat would describe that you
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
know his his agency has been for many
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
years underfunded understaffed and has
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
been living with a set of regulations
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
that in some cases are antiquated and we
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
would suggest that
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is one of them that we can make
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
step function improvement by by using
 
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
step function improvement by by using
science

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
and updating the regulation to something
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
that reflects
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
the knowledge base that we have today
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have a hundred years ago
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
when that bill when that regulation was
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
put in place
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's not to say some of those
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
regulations may still be fine
 
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.990 align:start position:0%
regulations may still be fine
but

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
it it gives us great concern that we're
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
operating with in some cases with
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations although they be
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
they may be large in number they may not
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
be effective in the way that they're
 
00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:46.069 align:start position:0%
be effective in the way that they're
actually

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
meant to be in terms of protecting the
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
health and the safety and the well-being
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the people of the state of new
 
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.510 align:start position:0%
of the people of the state of new
hampshire

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i think this in particular this
 
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.309 align:start position:0%
and i think this in particular this
setback

00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
setback
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
um is a an area that would have
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
we could make great improvement we could
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
significantly improve the protections to
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
some of our most precious resources
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
by making a a change to what is i think
 
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.190 align:start position:0%
by making a a change to what is i think
a

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
a relatively simple bill
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
the technology to do the testing and
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
understand it is well known
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
and it's something that we could
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
implement with no cost to the state and
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
with great uh protections benefits
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
coming from it
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
so i i think other states are struggling
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
with the same thing
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think the state of new hampshire from
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
what i can see
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
is lagging behind its neighbors
 
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.069 align:start position:0%
is lagging behind its neighbors
um

00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
we're not we haven't been as proactive
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's really good news that we're
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
waking up and seeing that there's
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
problems here and we're trying to
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
address them i think this is a very
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
smart bill that that makes us
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
a significant improvement and we need to
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
put it in place
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:56.069 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am cheers is there anyone
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
here from and head
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
how about the turnkey or waste
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
management is there anyone here from
 
00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:05.750 align:start position:0%
management is there anyone here from
there

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
there
no

00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
among the sub committee work group
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
members um myself representative contoir
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh rep stapleton and obviously
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
bixby is able
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
is not officially on the committee but
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
is able to participate but has no
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
no vote
 
00:53:27.599 --> 00:53:28.390 align:start position:0%
no vote
right

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.190 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
but among the three of us are there
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
additional questions for anybody
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay yeah no i can't uh i don't have any
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
other questions i wish that um
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
i do have another question for director
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%

yes
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak before the
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
for the record if you could just state
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
your name and of course hi good
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon and uh thank you for allowing
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
me to speak to you my name is john swann
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
i live in dalton new hampshire i'm the
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
founder of safe force lake uh we've been
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
involved in an effort to
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
protect and preserve our beautiful lake
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
and state park from
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
an encroaching landfill development
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and obviously as you've heard from other
 
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.870 align:start position:0%
and obviously as you've heard from other
people

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
our involvement in
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
all things solid waste has grown out of
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
our effort to stop this project
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
i did want to point out that obviously
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
the main point of this bill is to
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
address as was referenced prior
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
this old antiquated notion of a 200-foot
 
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
this old antiquated notion of a 200-foot
setback

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
setback
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
from a a body of water
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
in fact i don't think anybody can tell
 
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.030 align:start position:0%
in fact i don't think anybody can tell
you

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
where or when that actually became a
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
part of the statute but that's the the
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
issue here is just like so many other
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
numerous laws that are out there
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
a shortcoming that happens in society
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then people get together to address
 
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
and then people get together to address
it

00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
in order to fix that so that's what
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to do here
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
and worth the work of scientists
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
rep representative comtois asked some
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
great questions today relative to
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity and i was glad it was
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
very heartened to hear that
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
the expansions at mount carberry
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
have been referenced because
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
there's this false narrative that's
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
being circulated that new hampshire is
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
in a capacity crisis relative to solid
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
waste in landfills mount carberry
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
has a phase 3a permit application that
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
pushes them out to 2041 and they have a
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
phase 3b
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
expansion permit that would eventually
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
push them out to 2049 in terms of
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
capacity uh mount carberry takes in
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
about 90 000 tons of waste from maine
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
so imagine
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
as you heard uh from uh joe gay who
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
works for casella at nces
 
00:56:05.359 --> 00:56:06.549 align:start position:0%
works for casella at nces
currently

00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
with their uh stage six um expansion
 
00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.150 align:start position:0%
with their uh stage six um expansion
permit

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
they're able to take in around 200 000
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
tons or so
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
that could easily be assimilated by
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
mount carberry the only reason they're
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
taking waste in from out of state
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
is to help pay the bills so the capacity
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
is there for new hampshire waste in new
 
00:56:27.599 --> 00:56:29.109 align:start position:0%
is there for new hampshire waste in new
hampshire

00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
but one other point i'd like to make in
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the costs for hauling et cetera
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
think about it the city of concord
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
is under contract with casella and that
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
waste is being hauled to the north
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
country does that make any sense
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
think of the environmental impacts of
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
all that trucking whereas you look if
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
ncs when they do go away and they will
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
because this town of bethlehem does not
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
want that landfill in their town anymore
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
for many reasons
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
why can't concord waste easily
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
be taken to the turnkey landfill in
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
rochester which takes in about 60
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
percent of waste from out of state so
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
look at that what we're talking about
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
here was all these environmentally
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
related bills before the session or
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
before this uh legislature this year
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with solid waste and for
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
a reason
 
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.109 align:start position:0%
a reason
so

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
our outdoor economy
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
our our outdoor recreation and tourism
 
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
our our outdoor recreation and tourism
economies

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
economies
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
are doing so well record season this
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
past summer because
 
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.349 align:start position:0%
past summer because
of

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
our environment
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
so anyway i just i appreciate the effort
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
or the opportunity to speak today and i
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
just wanted to address that issue of
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
waste being hauled across the state not
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
only from maybe concord but from
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts to the north country which
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
makes no sense and there is plenty of
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
capacity with future expansions as
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
director wimsat mentioned so i just hope
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
someday someone will address with
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
director wimsat whether or not we have
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
an actual capacity crisis or
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
as we've alluded to or stated the ncs
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
landfill and the company casella has a
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
capacity crisis in new hampshire thank
 
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.150 align:start position:0%
capacity crisis in new hampshire thank
you

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.750 align:start position:0%
you
representative

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
so you just alluded to the fact that
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
the uh capacity of turnkey is from out
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
of state and that is used to offset um
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
operating costs if that was to reduce to
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
thirty percent how would that impact the
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
state as far as cost
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
can you can you rephrase that again say
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
that again sure
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that 60 of the turnkey
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
refuse is from out of state and that is
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
to offset the operating costs okay or
 
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.589 align:start position:0%
to offset the operating costs okay or
profitability

00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
profitability
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
if that was reduced to 30 percent how
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
would that affect new hampshire property
 
00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.069 align:start position:0%
would that affect new hampshire property
taxpayers

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
well first off uh as you point out
 
00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:04.630 align:start position:0%
well first off uh as you point out
turnkey

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
turnkey
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
waste management they're a private
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
corporation so obviously
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
at this point they're allowed to
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
bring in waste from wherever they want
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't curtail that
 
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.069 align:start position:0%
we can't we can't curtail that
um

00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
in in looking at everything that's
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
happening in new hampshire relative to
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste matters uh you point
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
something out or you
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
allude to something that
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
our state really needs to take a look at
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
instead of trash being
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
a profit center
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
trash should be looked at as a utility
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why you have like mark
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
morgan's lebanon landfill
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
you have the mount carberry landfill
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're not seeking to profit from waste
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
obviously they're seeking to
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
take care of their their citizens and
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
their towns that use that landfill so i
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
think that's the paradigm shift we need
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
to look at instead of worrying about
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
the profit center for a private
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.789 align:start position:0%
the profit center for a private
corporation

01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
um in terms of property values in
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
rochester i really can't speak to that i
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
mean that's something that
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
is obviously going to have to be looked
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
at but
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
what's the alternative to continue with
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
the status quo
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative bixby yeah
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
um i'd just like to point out that
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
this this committee
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
this committee hearing is about a very
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
narrow bill
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the discussion is
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
reaching out into a much broader
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh question of uh how are we dealing
 
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh question of uh how are we dealing
with

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity in the state as a
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
whole and what are all the internet
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
interconnecting factors
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that this is really the
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
time and place for that particular
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
discussion and i think that it might
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
make sense to just focus on
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh does this language serve the purpose
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we want it to and is this a purpose
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
representative complex i just want to
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank representative bixby for uh
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
reeling us back in and
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
um and i do see what representative
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
tucker again representative tucker do
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
you have additional thoughts that you'd
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
probably following on representative
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
bixby's comments
 
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
bixby's comments
uh

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know that you've ever decided
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
what to do with the remaining
 
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.549 align:start position:0%
what to do with the remaining
two

01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
boxed items both of which
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
are in section b
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and since you're focusing on getting
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
language to go to ols i hope
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh you need to decide whether you're
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to keep those or change those or
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's a very good point i
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
think we had spoken about them last time
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i just for if my memory serves
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
correct with the working group we had
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
discussed the words adequate and
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative last time and i thought
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
we were comfortable with that
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
but i want to make sure that i well when
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
i saw that the
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
draft that
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative bixby had been so kind
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
enough to work on still had the boxes i
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
was a little concerned
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
i see because i just wanted to get it
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
either in or out
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
sure can you speak to why the boxes are
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
still there yes maybe
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
failure of editing
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
i could have read i understand i could
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
have removed them because we actually
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
did pretty much resolve those last uh
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
last session both are both we can take i
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think we i think we agreed at the last
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
session that both of those things and
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
most of the boxed
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
bits of text in
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
section in paragraph b
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh were fine as is and i think that we
 
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.150 align:start position:0%
uh were fine as is and i think that we
also

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
also
uh

01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.870 align:start position:0%
uh
were

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much resolved that the box in
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
paragraph in
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
on the middle paragraph was now the
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
middle paragraph
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
was not good
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh which is why i have a strike through
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
it i understand
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
the preamble is essential i'm just very
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
getting it ready to go to uh
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
the ols office yeah so thank you
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative tucker and thank you
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i i'm uh other than spelling errors
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
which i i noticed there are at least two
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
um is there anything else in the
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
preamble that uh
 
01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.309 align:start position:0%
preamble that uh
would

01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't work for people
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
i did want to go back to the
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
conversation that representative
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
stapleton had regarding the water
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
surface water interplay
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
and my question to you representative
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
and to you representative contoir
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
are about the inclusion of that 485
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
colon c if you felt like that was
 
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
colon c if you felt like that was
something

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
that you were seeking or where you
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
were going with that
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you for the
 
01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:12.549 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you for the
question

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
i do believe that
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
from the testimony we've heard and from
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
what we know that
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:04:19.119 --> 01:04:20.230 align:start position:0%
it is
integral

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
integral
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
surface and ground waters interconnected
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
interplay between them
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i think we should at least make a
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
reference to the statute um
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
so that it's clear that uh there are
 
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
so that it's clear that uh there are
other

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
rsa legal lawful parameters that have to
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
be considered and you know it seems like
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
the industry knows that
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
and are engaged in it but for the
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
clarity of law and
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
and statement in the bill i believe we
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
should make the reference to the uh
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
585 a 485 c groundwater at least as a
 
01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
585 a 485 c groundwater at least as a
linkage

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
linkage
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
when representative tucker and i talked
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
earlier on it might even be preference
 
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
earlier on it might even be preference
with

01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
and other ground and other water sources
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
or maybe you could say and other
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
groundwater sources or something of
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
similar ilk
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
so that it's
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
expresses our concern for protection of
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
controlled did you have any thoughts
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
around this um well i'm just reading
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
here and it looks like groundwater and
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
surface water protection are integral
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
parts of the siting permitting um and
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's under and it says here under
 
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
it's under and it says here under
environmental-sw805

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
environmental-sw805
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
surface water protection standards
 
01:05:38.319 --> 01:05:39.510 align:start position:0%
surface water protection standards
section

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
and rules so there is a rule i believe
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
already in place for that
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i could be wrong but we could double
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
yeah since we're having a citation here
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
within the bill of
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
um
what

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
does it hurt to have
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
reference to the 485 so we've got both
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
surface and ground waters referenced and
 
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
surface and ground waters referenced and
linked

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
linked
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
even if it might be stated elsewhere at
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
least a
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
single reading of this bill would make
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
i have a couple concerns um
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
and i do have another question for
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative tucker if you don't mind
 
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.950 align:start position:0%
representative tucker if you don't mind
absolutely

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.430 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
um

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
we were it was listed that there are
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
eight or ten other states
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
that have similar legislation
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm just trying to find out the
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
geography of those states i know maine
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
was mentioned as one and i was just
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
wondering about the other states only
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire is pretty unique
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
in its makeup because every single town
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and city in new hampshire except for one
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
has water running through it and i'm
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
just concerned about how this will
 
01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.789 align:start position:0%
just concerned about how this will
affect

01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:05.829 align:start position:0%
affect
um

01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
future landfill sightings that's all so
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering about the geography
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the other states
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
i do know that maine
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous amount of lakes and
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
ponds that is the
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
state that i have actually read the
 
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.829 align:start position:0%
state that i have actually read the
material

01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
bedrock wise to new hampshire
 
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
bedrock wise to new hampshire
and

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.349 align:start position:0%
i i think that
we

01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
can be assured that there are good sites
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
director wimsat has not implied that
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
he does say we have a complicated state
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
and certainly for a small state it is
 
01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
and certainly for a small state it is
complicated

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is the
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
it's our job to protect the population
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
almost all of us have had the misfortune
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
of living places where
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't know
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
what they were doing at the time
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
certainly the connecticut river is one
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
of those places i grew up in concord
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
mass the concord river
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
all of those the merrimack they all were
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
polluted terribly and the androscoggin
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
which has a mercury problem that's
 
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.510 align:start position:0%
which has a mercury problem that's
incredible

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
after 10 years they still haven't been
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
able to implement a plan to remediate
 
01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:41.749 align:start position:0%
able to implement a plan to remediate
and

01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
so our focus in this bill is
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
to protect the citizens of new hampshire
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
the visitors to new hampshire the future
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
and the wildlife of new hampshire that's
 
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.749 align:start position:0%
and the wildlife of new hampshire that's
dependent

01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
dependent
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
as we are mammals mammals birds
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
all life depends on the purity of water
 
01:09:02.159 --> 01:09:03.269 align:start position:0%
all life depends on the purity of water
so

01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you representative
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
tucker um
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
so this uh
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
the text of this bill is going to be
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
inserted into rsa 149 m9
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering uh just so that we have a
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
sense of what the broader context within
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
state statute is going to be where what
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.839 --> 01:09:41.349 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
are we actually going to mention other
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
rsas in here well no the just the the um
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
the the enacting paragraph uh
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the enacting uh section says
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
amanda rsa 149 colon m9 by inserting
 
01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
amanda rsa 149 colon m9 by inserting
after

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
um uh uh
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
after paragraph uh
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
14 the following new paragraphs
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
and so this is so this text is going to
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
be that's where this text is going to be
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
insert inserted that's why we turned to
 
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
ols okay so
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that's really what they are so
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
so you're not you're not familiar with
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
the broader context
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not either no okay
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
i must admit that i've
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
kept a very sort of laser focus on what
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
we're up to here okay and i am dependent
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
on ols right and uh
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
the person who
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
works with this area right so the reason
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm asking is because i want to
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that it would actually make
 
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
make sure that it would actually make
sense

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.189 align:start position:0%
sense
to

01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
figure out whether
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
adding a reference to the groundwater
 
01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.270 align:start position:0%
adding a reference to the groundwater
in

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
in
c

01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
c
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
would make sense in that larger
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
statutory context and i it looks like it
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like i need to do a little bit of
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
to to pose
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
if you could help pose the question
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
for ols to answer
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then in turn
 
01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
and then in turn
uh

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
courtney eisenbach is in touch with des
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that's her area of specialty
 
01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
and that's her area of specialty
so

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's i think the best way to get that
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative bixby also um
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
149 m is quite a large
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
the statute is so large it covers so
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
many things
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
so um i just wanted to
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
mention that it literally talks about
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
all things related to solid waste
 
01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.430 align:start position:0%
all things related to solid waste
management

01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.149 align:start position:0%
management
so

01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:57.510 align:start position:0%
so
from

01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goals all the way down
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
to citing criteria and then some okay so
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
um there are various subsections within
 
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.390 align:start position:0%
um there are various subsections within
149m

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
149m
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
and with that i do think that
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know i i
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
i do think we might have some drafting
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions here that we need to get
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
answered about just in general about
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
the 45c and whether or not that is
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
pertinent or
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
to this area but i do understand
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton's concerns in
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to make sure that both surface
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater are addressed
 
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.669 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater are addressed
right

01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:44.709 align:start position:0%
right
so

01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:45.430 align:start position:0%
so
with

01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
that representative control do you have
 
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
that representative control do you have
thoughts

01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
well i i sometimes think thank you madam
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
chair i sometimes think that when we get
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
confined things too much in legislation
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
we actually hamstring
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's doing the rulemaking
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i like to be as concise as
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
possible but as i cited there's already
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the rules uh the link between
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater and drinking water
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
chairman pearl
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i appreciate you
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing me just for the benefit of
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and all those that are
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
here today and listening i've scheduled
 
01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
here today and listening i've scheduled
another

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
final work session on this bill next
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
tuesday at uh
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
10 30. so it's but it's not going to be
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's more or less going to be a wrap-up
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee so that you can make
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to the full committee

close out the subcommittee work session
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
before i do yeah i actually have a
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
question for chairman pearl uh
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh the dra drafting and
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment on this
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a preference in terms of who
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
would the who the sponsor of that draft
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
not at this time but let me think about
 
01:15:44.159 --> 01:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
not at this time but let me think about
that

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll have to think about that i
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's going to matter i
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
probably should be someone from your
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but uh
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that it has to be so
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
it definitely has to be somebody from
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
the full committee
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
so all things being equal i would
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think that would be appropriate i'll
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration thank you
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay and so with that we're going to
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
