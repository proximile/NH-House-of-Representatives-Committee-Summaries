00:02:17.220 --> 00:12:01.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
yes it's the time change I'm going to
 
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:06.740 align:start position:0%
say we're 52 minutes early
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
but with that division three uh work
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
session is going to start
 
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
um the initial topics for today is uh Mr
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
Wieters who runs it for DH HHS is here
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
today we had three items from hb2
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
conversations that we wanted to get some
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
details on from him one was a little
 
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
over 20 million on mmis the other two
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
were both Consulting and then if he
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
comes up with the fourth item we'll talk
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
about that but then after that I intend
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
to go back to the hb2 document where I
 
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.060 align:start position:0%
think the last one we finished was uh
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
item 253 so we'll pick up at 254.
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
and then Mr Ripple has prepared a sheet
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
that summarizes all of the Departments
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's hb1 and hb2 requests isn't it
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
the one that I have here is hb1 only but
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
I can print out the handful of requests
 
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
that they had for husband too as well
 
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.170 align:start position:0%
that they had for husband too as well
okay

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.180 align:start position:0%

and then
 
00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.250 align:start position:0%
and then
um

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple you're better at remembering
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
this than I am what which of the hb2
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
items are we talking about when we talk
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
about the 20 point x million for mmis
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.009 align:start position:0%

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
okay I see it and the and the basic
 
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
thing is that we're trying to pull
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
23 million excuse me we're trying to
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
pull the money from the 23 Surplus
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
all right go go ahead dude I I think you
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
listened to some of the video last week
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
did you just want to start talking or do
 
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
you want me to ask you a question to get
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
it going
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
I did listen to the recording from last
 
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
week so I can try to address some of the
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions that you had that Nathan
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
deferred to me if if that's your request
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that that'd be great it's
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's still early in the morning for me
 
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
it's still early in the morning for me
okay

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um just for the record my name is David
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
Wieters Information Services director
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
for Department of Health and Human
 
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.949 align:start position:0%
for Department of Health and Human
Services

00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
So based off of the questions of what is
 
00:15:25.569 --> 00:15:25.579 align:start position:0%
the 20 million dollars 20 million 531
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
625 that was in hp2
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is associated with our process
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
um in this current biennium where we
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
submitted the operating costs for the
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
or mmis at
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
um in hb1 for the current biennium that
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
as a result of the legislative process
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
was pulled out of hb1 and put into hb2
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
as a one-time cost for maintaining and
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
operating that system
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
alongside there was an hb25 component
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
that supported the Capital Improvements
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
for the hardware and software that we
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
have completed
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
so there's two components that are at
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
play here and for the 24 25 biennium we
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
again submitted the operating costs
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
which the total costs of this system is
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
about 45 million per year
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
of which we get 75 percent federal funds
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
which equates to about 10 million
 
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:22.940 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
of General funds to
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
support that Medicaid management
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
information system so let's let's pause
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
for a moment certainly and
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
um Mr White do you what what what page
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
in hb1 is the mmis money that Mr Wieters
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:48.740 align:start position:0%
924 I see
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
8009 Medicaid management information
 
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.350 align:start position:0%
8009 Medicaid management information
system

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
I see total source of funds and 22 as 35
 
00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:03.769 align:start position:0%
I see total source of funds and 22 as 35
million

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
and in the next two years 175
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
000 a year is that accurate yes that's
 
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.970 align:start position:0%
000 a year is that accurate yes that's
correct

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
listen listen to Mr weeder's uh bef
 
00:17:19.929 --> 00:17:19.939 align:start position:0%
before the hearing
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
hb2 thinking that was one time money and
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
that we left a smaller maintenance tale
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
for operations and maintenance basic you
 
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.049 align:start position:0%
for operations and maintenance basic you
know

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
simple updates not up there was there
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
it's about 45 million dollars a year or
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
per budget Mr readers who is it per year
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
or per two-year budget 45 million
 
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.150 align:start position:0%
or per two-year budget 45 million
so

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
um in state fiscal year 24 it would be a
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
total of 41 million dollars it's 9.7
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
General funds 9.7 million General funds
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 25 it would be a
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
total of 45 million dollars uh 10.8
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna actually go
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
over that one more time 24 what should
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
the bottom line be for this account
 
00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:16.190 align:start position:0%
the bottom line be for this account
yeah

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
just asking where this is so we can
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow along that's that's what I'm
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
trying to do I think we're on page 924
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking right now about the
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
total source of funds which is about 40
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
percent of the way down that page on 924
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
right now in 24 it says 175 188
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
what what should the real
 
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
operations and updates
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
not upgrades updates money B and 24
 
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.010 align:start position:0%
not upgrades updates money B and 24
total

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.020 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.789 align:start position:0%
total
so

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:52.130 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
so it would be approximately 41 million
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
two hundred and ninety nine thousand
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thirty dollars two I'm
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
gonna put it 41 3 just to keep it simple
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and then what is the breakdown and 24
 
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
of that 41-3 between Federal and general
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
so the the general funds would be
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
approximately 9.7 million
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the the federal would be
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 31.4 million
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's have the same exact
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
conversation for 25 then yep so for 25
 
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.810 align:start position:0%
conversation for 25 then yep so for 25
the

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:34.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:39.740 align:start position:0%
approximate total would be uh
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
45.3 million dollars total funds and
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
then the split the general funds would
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
be 10.8 million dollars
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
and the federal funds and safe fiscal
 
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:53.660 align:start position:0%
year 25 would be
 
00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
so so so saying what you just shared
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
with us
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
this uh as a the hb2 item for 20.5
 
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.190 align:start position:0%
this uh as a the hb2 item for 20.5
million

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
that is basically the general funds for
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
24 and 25.
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
yes that that's the combined General
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
funds and then you'll also see in that
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
hb2 language there's a provision to
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
accept the federal funds
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
um without fiscal committee approval and
 
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
so those other federal funds so just one
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
thing at a time just stay on the money
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
for a second yep
 
00:20:40.919 --> 00:20:41.810 align:start position:0%
for a second yep
um

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:45.260 align:start position:0%
okay now so this is uh this is a
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
financial technical question
 
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:53.179 align:start position:0%
can can we have the 9.7 and the 10.8
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
and still have it covered by these 23
 
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.710 align:start position:0%
and still have it covered by these 23
funds

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
so there are two issues I want there I
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
want I want to roll forward any money
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
that we had intended for this project so
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
that we can use it in the next fiscal
 
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.350 align:start position:0%
that we can use it in the next fiscal
year

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.210 align:start position:0%
year
but

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
but I also want to start getting our
 
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
operating money looking right for future
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
division threes so Mr Ripple go ahead
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
well I guess I would start with a
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
oh sorry do you have an idea of how much
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
we don't anticipate any laps out of this
 
00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:45.539 align:start position:0%
this is um the funds that are here they
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
pay for fixed contracted costs each
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
contract has a fixed price limitation so
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
we don't expect much of any lapse coming
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
out of this particular account
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there's any money here
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
that you could roll forward from 23 you
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
could find money elsewhere in the budget
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
and Roll It Forward from 23 for this
 
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.210 align:start position:0%
and Roll It Forward from 23 for this
purpose

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little more complicated that way
 
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.450 align:start position:0%
it's a little more complicated that way
though

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
but it's already here I understand what
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
it's already here being rolled forward
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
from 23 right
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
well the governor's
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget spends it in 23.
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
so I think what representative Edwards
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
has suggested is is spending it in 24-25
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
which wouldn't necessitate carrying
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
funds over from 23.
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
isn't that what we're doing
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
it it it is what we're doing with hb2
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir what what is causing me to be
 
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
perplexed about the whole thing
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
my assumption for the last two years has
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
been wrong
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
I thought that the money that we put
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
into hb2 last term was one-time money
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
what I have been shocked to find out
 
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.610 align:start position:0%
what I have been shocked to find out
today

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
is it the total amount of money that we
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
spend on operations and maintenance
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
which includes updates not upgrades but
 
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
which includes updates not upgrades but
updates

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
updates
 
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.029 align:start position:0%
updates
hmm

00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
is a lot
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
you know and I I and because it was so
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
much I had assumed it was an upgrade
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
cost that was one time
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
so initially I was pretty comfortable
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
with having
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
this hb2 item here because I thought
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
this was still
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh upgrade money and and so I just
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to know the history of it that's
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's how we got into this the the the
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
the the problem is now there's this huge
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
operations tail
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
that I think needs to be an hb1 because
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
that's proper accounting
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how to do that go ahead
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
one possibility maybe this won't work
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
but one possibility is just to put in
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
the section 235 note the actual numbers
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
that and reflect that it's for this much
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
in 23 and for this I mean in 24 and for
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
this much in 25 and then put in the hb1
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
a note that says
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
this account is currently being budgeted
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
in hp2 this year so that people can see
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
both sides of that coin if they look
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
backwards I don't know if that's
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
possible that's legal to do but I think
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
what I heard you just say and it sounds
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
right to me and Mr Ripple you you be the
 
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
judge of this is that we can footnote we
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
can keep the numbers low
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
in in the hb1 and just footnote it to
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
say that the funds are coming from this
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
hp2 item and in the hb2 item we could
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
write this with a little more Precision
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
to show how much is going to each of the
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
years and that this is really operations
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
and maintenance as opposed to
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
um upgrades and that way whoever does
 
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
this next budget will have a better idea
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
when they look at the historical record
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you could do that and that
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
way you could continue funding it out of
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
the 23 Surplus in House Bill 2 you would
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
just make it clear that it's for
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
operational costs in 24.25
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the first time I think
 
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:18.980 align:start position:0%
we've talked about footnoting anything
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
at some point we're going to probably
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
spend time a day or something looking at
 
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.490 align:start position:0%
spend time a day or something looking at
footnotes

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
footnotes
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know that you have a a full day
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
to look at footnotes but if anybody has
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
um any concerns with footnotes or any
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
interest in particular footnotes that
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
you'd like to amend or take out or add
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
by all means let me know and I'll I'll
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
add them to the the tracking sheet that
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm about to hand out later okay the
 
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
only footnotes I'd like you know
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted would be those that have
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
changed if we've got essentially the
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
same footnote from last budget to the
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
current budget then I I'm okay just
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
assuming that that makes sense but if
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're changing a footnote you know
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
particularly around lapsing and
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing I I think we should probably
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
consider it do you have a question go
 
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.049 align:start position:0%
consider it do you have a question go
ahead

00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
then my question is really for Kevin I
 
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.990 align:start position:0%
then my question is really for Kevin I
think

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
think
um

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
two years from now
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
what is this page going to look like is
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
it going to look similar to the way this
 
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:21.299 align:start position:0%
one does now with it a
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
a big chunk of money in
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I I think it
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
probably would look that way I think if
 
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
the funds even if you add a footnote to
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit if the funds
 
00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:38.779 align:start position:0%
themselves are not reflected in 24 25
 
00:26:41.409 --> 00:26:41.419 align:start position:0%
the house bill one side will be lower
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
and the house bill there will probably
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
be a house bill 2 component of it as
 
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
be a house bill 2 component of it as
well

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
okay well I just wanted to try to figure
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
out and there won't really be any way
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
for the next people I mean hopefully
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
some of us will still be here and we'll
 
00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.140 align:start position:0%
remember this page and
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
everyone will remind us of it but there
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't be any way for someone
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
just to open the page
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
and know what had happened
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
I think you might see if I take a look
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
at the governor's budget you might see
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
the old footnotes so if a footnote is
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
added oh no you don't see the old
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
footnotes okay
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
so you're right there really wouldn't be
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
anything but but whoever the LBA will
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
see the footnotes
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
where do these those footnotes live when
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure they they just don't
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
appear again in the next budget but we
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
would have the history in form in the
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
form of the detailed change sheets that
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
we produce
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the budget compare reports so we
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be able to see it
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay no that that answers my question
 
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and then Paul
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
um I just want to clarify one thing
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
you said the capital budget covered the
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
upgrades are we talking about the
 
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
pre-major upgrade that you just
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
completed in maybe a month or six weeks
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
ago or something
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes that the
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
about a month ago we completed the
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
hardware and software upgrades utilizing
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
the essentially 24 million dollars of
 
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
the 90 million dollar capital budget for
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
mmis life cycle replacement
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
and was that 24 million dollars
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the current budget cycle
 
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.130 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the current budget cycle
right

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
my hearing faded
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
would you did you just ask that the
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
money that just got spent came out of
 
00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
money that just got spent came out of
hb25

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
hb25
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yes the money for the
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
major upgrade major upgrade came out of
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
HP 25 capital budget yes okay that's my
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
question I think that when you and you
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
agreed with that I think yeah if I can
 
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.990 align:start position:0%
agreed with that I think yeah if I can
clarify

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
um because just make sure because we're
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
looking at two different components so
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
that the 24 million dollars for the
 
00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
major hardware and software upgrades of
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
this of the current mmis system was
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
funded out of hb25 for the current
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
biennium and we did complete that work
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
last month
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
but the hb2 items for this biennium was
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance and operations and
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
so there and that the challenge is the
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
numbers are pretty close like there's 20
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
million versus 24 million so they can
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
get really confusing really fast
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
so just to call back so that last part
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
was in the HB it was like just like this
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
note we have here with two section 235
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's a similar section in the last by
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
any or the current biennium is hp2
 
00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
spending the 20 or whatever was a
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance contracts is that
 
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I guess
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
sorry for being late to this entire
 
00:29:57.539 --> 00:29:58.789 align:start position:0%
sorry for being late to this entire
discussion

00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
is there any reason we can't long term
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
in this process move it over to hb1 so
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
it's really clear and transparent
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
I entered the room at that point when
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
can I try that and and then if I get it
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
wrong then you can correct me and I'll
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
have learned something
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
you and I agree that would be preferable
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
the challenge with it is
 
00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
the challenge with it is
um

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:29.049 --> 00:30:29.059 align:start position:0%
I like having that huge amount of money
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
paid for out of surplus from fy23
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
and because of that objective it
 
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
primarily has to live in hb2
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is making sure
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
that we footnote hb1 so that these
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
artificially low numbers
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of an audit Trail for
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
future future division threes to
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance is an hb1
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
item and one-time projects are either an
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
hb2 or in this case hb25
 
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
did I get that close
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
so in in the words of our former House
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
member and finance member of a long time
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
former representative Allen Court
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
what was his comment for German version
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
of a shell game
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
um that he used to say what I'd like to
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
see is a footnote in hb2 that says we're
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
going to move this money from 23 into
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
this category so that we have the paper
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
trail from 23 with the excess funds to
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
push it over and then in 24 and 25 show
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
that it's in the correct category is
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
there a way to do that so so again we're
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
in violent agreement so before you came
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
in I guess we talked about having this
 
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:51.020 align:start position:0%
hp2 language
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
augmented to be more clear what we're
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
doing and why we're doing it and how
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're using it
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
correct and I'm okay with the hb2
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
language saying we're taking 20-ish
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
million dollars whatever the right
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
number is and we're moving it out of 23
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
excess revenues and we're putting it
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
into this category but making sure that
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the budget for HP one and two sorry
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
hb1 424 and 25 it clearly shows what
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're spending so
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
the novices on next the next budget
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
cycle who are on finance can see the
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
one thing that happened a few times two
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
years ago is there were a few sections
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2.
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
of the HHS lapse non-lapsing carried
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
forward into the upcoming budget and
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
treated as restricted revenue for the
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of funding something specific
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
you could do that in this case you could
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
make approximately 20.5 million
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
of the HH of what would otherwise lapse
 
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.490 align:start position:0%
of the HH of what would otherwise lapse
non-lapsing

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
and treat it as
 
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
restricted funds for use in the Medicaid
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
management information system accounting
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
unit and then it would show the numbers
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
would show up in there and they would
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
effectively be funded out of 23 Surplus
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
so the good news is the HP one
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
audit Trail will be clearer and easier
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
to follow in in better shape next time
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
division three looks at this in two
 
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.889 align:start position:0%
division three looks at this in two
years

00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
the to the extent that there's bad news
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some there's got to be
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
some bad news here so so what's the bad
 
00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:34.430 align:start position:0%
some bad news here so so what's the bad
news

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
news
 
00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
I don't know that there's necessarily
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
bad news it does get increasingly
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
complex if you try to do this
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
across multiple topics on multiple
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
issues I guess if you're confining it to
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
mmis it's pretty it's pretty simple all
 
00:33:48.169 --> 00:33:48.179 align:start position:0%
right right now I'm just trying to
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
confine it to mmis because I I still
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
think we're cleaning up my mistake from
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
two years ago where I thought this was
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
one-time money not operations and
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance money and so we got to get
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
the books looking like reality I think
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Kevin that's very helpful
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
um just of the committee does anybody
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
have any major heartache about doing
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
what was just proposed by Mr Ripple in
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
terms of documenting this funds left
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
over from 23 or moving over to 24 as
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
restricted use funds non-lapsing so that
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
it can be better accounted for in the
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle in terms of
 
00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:31.669 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle in terms of
transparency

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
when we get past this I I do think that
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
works but when we get past it I have a
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
couple of questions I want to ask about
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
this area
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would propose that we ask Mr
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
Ripple to do that just for the
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
cleanliness of next year's budget cycle
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
I I like a clean budget cycle so we've
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
discussed two alternatives on how to
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
handle this Mr Ripple are you clear on
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
the second one
 
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay represent walner
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
if we're past that can I ask a couple of
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
different questions
 
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.970 align:start position:0%
different questions
um

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:21.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
this account seems to be going up fairly
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
rapidly I mean in it looks like your
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
actual expense in 22 was 35 million
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
and in I think I just heard you say by
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
the time we do all these transfers and
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
everything it's in 25 it's going to be
 
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
45 million
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
and that's a 10 million dollar increase
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I know a chunk of that is federal
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
but what is called why is this going at
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
this rate and how often do we
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I'll
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
answer the second part first but we this
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
contract is a five-year contract with
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
the option to renew for another five
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
years if we so choose and get up and get
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
approved through government executive
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
Council the so where are we in the
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
contract cycle right now we're ending
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
year two of of five
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
so we'll have three more fiscal years on
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
this contract
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
um before a renewal would be requested
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
the contract itself was re was renewed
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
for that five-year term to allow the
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
department to go through a
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
re-procurement of the entire Medicaid
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
management information system following
 
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
CMS guidelines for modular reprocurement
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
we are about we're two years into that
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
process of the project
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of answering a question of how
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's moving up
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
the the cost to
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
um provide there's many components of
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
the system and it can get pretty
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
detailed but the there's one component
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
where any provider should be able to
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
query the system to identify if their
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
claims are being processed and being or
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible for processing there's a
 
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
cost for every time they do that
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
transaction those costs have gone up as
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
more providers come online as well as
 
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.390 align:start position:0%
more providers come online as well as
the

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
the cost to maintain and operate the the
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
changes in the legislator from both
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
federal and state to maintain the
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
programs or making augmentations or
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
enhancements to the system which then
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
increases the maintenance and operations
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
with couple examples is
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
as part of the 21st century cures act we
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
had to add another function for any
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
individual to be able to go online for
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
self-service portal to see the claims
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
that were processed on their behalf
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
that cost additional money it was an
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
additional enhancement to the system
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
that is costing us a little over a
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year to maintain and
 
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.470 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year to maintain and
operate

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.310 align:start position:0%
operate
um

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
our goal with the re-procurement effort
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
is to do a couple of things one is to
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
get better competitiveness for the
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
solutions that are out there like
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
provider management claims management
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
financial management data warehousing
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
and third party liability
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
and with that with that goal is to see
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
if we can drive the costs down from that
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
competition perspective and also build
 
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.530 align:start position:0%
competition perspective and also build
um

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
A system that CMS will continue to
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
support our enhanced 75 maintenance
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
Federal fund match
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't know what those costs
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
will be historically what we've seen in
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
other states is that the modular
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
reprocurement is actually increased cost
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
due to the Integrations that you now
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
need to do between multiple vendors
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
but there are some states that the
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's five or six or seven contracts
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
resulted in the same vendor
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
and but it was still competitively
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
compute procured and did Drive their
 
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
costs down so it's it's trying to figure
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
out as we go through the procurement
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
methodology maintaining our compliance
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
with our federal Partners guidelines but
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
trying to see how we can drive those
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
so if I understand all of that what I I
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
guess what I got out of it was that
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's a contract
 
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.510 align:start position:0%
it's a contract
but

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
this contract actually is in a contract
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
for an exact amount of dollars at the
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
beginning of a contract because you're
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
buying you may need more services during
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
the contract period is that
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
am I
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
getting that correct my apologies the
 
00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
contract is a fixed cost for each year
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
or year over year but there's a
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
year-over-year increase based off of
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
inflation and anticipation we do have
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
what's called enhancement pool hours
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
that are included in the contract to
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
allow us to do those enhancements and
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
it's only if we go above and beyond our
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
existing contract language that we would
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
do a contract Amendment
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example we plan on
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
submitting some Amendment to the
 
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
existing contract to support medical
 
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.690 align:start position:0%
existing contract to support medical
coding

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
coding
 
00:40:28.329 --> 00:40:28.339 align:start position:0%
um in in the near future
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
to the governor executive Council for
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
their approval so as new things get
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
required of us to be able to adhere to
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
federal reporting in this case this is a
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
federal requirement then we go through
 
00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:44.339 align:start position:0%
and we do we look at the contract and
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
see can we do it with the existing
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
contract scope or do we need to amend
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
the the contract and find additional
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
funding to support it
 
00:40:56.569 --> 00:40:56.579 align:start position:0%
so the so the metaphor I use on that is
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
like if you were to go contract to have
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
your roof replaced that would be a fixed
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
price because they'd be able to bid in
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
everything into it but then as they
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
start to do the work you go oh wait a
 
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
second let's do some gutters on that too
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
and then afterwards you go you know
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
those gutters ought to be those fancy
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
ones where no leads can get in each of
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
those is an upgrade opportunity that you
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
get dinged on the contract and that's
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
that million dollar example that Mr
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
wieders provided earlier yeah
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
and one more and this one you're going
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
to give me the explanation and I'm going
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
to get oh sure I knew that
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
so I see the actual expense for 22.
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
I see that we're moving over
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
this 20 million dollars to make 24 and
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
I I believe because it was an hb2
 
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
provision the the the budget system does
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
not show those figures here and Kevin I
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have better insight
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
because the appropriation was made
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
through the house bill 2 process which
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
is part of the challenge that we're
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
talking about here yeah okay so that so
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's exactly where it happened this
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
time also okay yeah thank you
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
represent nordgren did you have a
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
question okay a representative Hull Mr
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
chair and and this last point is exactly
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
why I'd like to see some of this I
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
recently saw an advertisement where they
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
were describing well the state didn't
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
spend any money in the budget and that
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
was how they phrased it although we
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
spent millions and millions of dollars
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
by Framing that it wasn't spent in the
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
budget it hides these things and I don't
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
want that behavior to continue so by
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
forcing whatever we can over into hb1
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
even if it's non-lapsing restricted
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue type stuff that helps make sure
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
that in the future that doesn't show up
 
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:04.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
Kevin did you have a response to that it
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
looked like you were wanting to talk but
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
I didn't have a response to that but I
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
did just want to comment that I I'm
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
pretty sure there have been instances in
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
which funding in-house Bill 2 as well as
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
other bills has been reflected in the
 
00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized figures but that's
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
not something that
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
the LBA or the legislature has control
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
over it's something that would happen
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
within Das so I guess there's no
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee as in this case there's no
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
guarantee that a house bill 2
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation would show up in the
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized figures
 
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.750 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized figures
foreign

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
specifically in hb1 with language in hb2
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
to drive it there right then Das doesn't
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
have the ability right they would be it
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
would be tracked naturally correct I'm
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
saying as a straight general fund
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation it wouldn't be guaranteed
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
to show up in the adjusted authorized
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
is that true just for clarity for any
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
other funds within hb1 and hb2 if we
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
didn't let's just say hypothetically in
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
hb2 there was a 500 000 allotment for I
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't know Christmas trees for everybody
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
and would the as have to put that in
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
I think typically you would expect to
 
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
see it if it's an ongoing operational
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
expense so as I think this this through
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
now I'm wondering if it's because it was
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
labeled as a one-time expense in House
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 the last time maybe that's the
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
reason they didn't put it in here
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you well that was exactly the
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
narrative because I that's what I
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
thought was the truth after we had
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
hearings like this I thought that was
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
the truth that there was a one-time
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
wedge that she'd go into hb2 and it was
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
in retrospective
 
00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
45 million dollar mistake but um
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay so if we do can I go back now
 
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I'm I'm
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
tracking where we're at if we put this
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
into HP one just like we said then we'll
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
put a there's restricted money that will
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
go to it to pay for it in hb1 for 24 and
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
25. what what happens to
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
235 what some kind of a rewrite right
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
it would be Rewritten we would say that
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
the department would be able to carry
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
forward 20.5 million dollars into 2425
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
and it would be treated as restricted
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue in this accounting unit for the
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of funding mmis
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thanks I I just I
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask a couple questions
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
related to the provider you say you're
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
designing or implementing provider
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
systems that's part of what the software
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
packages are are you integrating to
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
um to the providers directly or are you
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
trying to integrate with software
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
vendors that may provide billing support
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
systems for providers already or how how
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
I can get the details but I don't know
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
the exact details but I do know the the
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
goal the provider management module for
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
all most of the states out there is that
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
it's a vendor-ledge solution for the
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
providers to connect to but they don't
 
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:19.460 align:start position:0%
have interoperability with their systems
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
primarily because of different
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding privacy and
 
00:46:25.809 --> 00:46:25.819 align:start position:0%
Security in every state
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly follow up to get a
 
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
more detailed answer if you need it
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
so technically I think whatever we're
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
sending out to the providers is some
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
sort of a thin client that comes from
 
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
the the application and that there's no
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
integration at the provider end just
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
available use of a Thin Client that's my
 
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.550 align:start position:0%
available use of a Thin Client that's my
guess

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
trying to stay at a high level what the
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
way the providers interact with our
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
system right now is they start off by
 
00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
submitting an application an actual
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
digital application through which we we
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
consume and process their application
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
and then provide them a provider id in
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
which they can submit their claims and
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
do claims eligibility
 
00:47:14.819 --> 00:47:15.490 align:start position:0%
do claims eligibility
um

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:15.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
requests through an electronic data
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
interchange or an EDI transaction so it
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
is a digital interface for them to
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
do the claims processing of Eligibility
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
and then submit their claims to us for
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
processing on our system but it's not
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
integrated with their system so they
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
they actually have to do that component
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
of submitting
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
their data through like an FTP or file
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
transfer protocol type process
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
and follow up go ahead
 
00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:50.540 align:start position:0%
um and um for dual eligibles is that
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
CMS medicare Medicaid is that built in
 
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:55.700 align:start position:0%
or is that
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
a single I would have to get back to you
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
on that okay thank you
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
all right I think uh I think this is
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
officially Beat to Death so are we ready
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
to are we huh
 
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
beats alive uh let's let's go over to
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
the two Consulting hp2 items what what
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay are these these are two separate
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
things with some common questions
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the common question is this this
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
basically says that you need some help
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe it
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't tell us where this help
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
is going to be applied in terms of which
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
projects which Commissioners priorities
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
 
00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing
foreign

00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you um based off the conversation
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
on Friday and then following up so
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
starting with the section
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
245 on page 81 that 1.5 million dollars
 
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.069 align:start position:0%
245 on page 81 that 1.5 million dollars
for

00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
essentially it's for project managers
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and business analysts for the for the
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
following projects and so those projects
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
are Incident Management System that was
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
really really meant really meant to
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
support the intake of any type of
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
incident from for dcyf or children of
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
children youth and families the New
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and public health
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
they have totally different needs and
 
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
business requirements but we found that
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
we can build one solution to be able to
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
manage like a New Hampshire hospital
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
where they might have a spill in the
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
hallway that they need to report in how
 
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
someone react to Public Health needs to
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
have the ability to track incidents as
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
it relates to their working with um
 
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
with the public health networks where
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
they're saying hey we have a problem
 
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
with the disease surveillance system we
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
want you to resolve this bug and then
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
with dcyf they they work with their
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
providers where they might do restraint
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
and they have to report that restraint
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
to dcyf and all the components so that's
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
one solution with multiple different
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
like perspectives
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to to do that as a
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
concerted effort so that we don't have
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
three different Incident Management
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
systems and three different maintenance
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
and operations costs so that's one of
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
the projects the other the other five
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
projects are Housing Services for mental
 
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:39.890 align:start position:0%
projects are Housing Services for mental
health

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
environmental health management system
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
for Public Health
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
data analytics for Behavioral Health so
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
further furthering their data analytics
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
so that they can have informed decisions
 
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
and then the automated federal reporting
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid so there's a there's a
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
current report but many reports that we
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
have to send either monthly or quarterly
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
to our federal Partners in many cases
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
their manual Excel spreadsheets with
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
access databases our goal is to put
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
those into our Enterprise basis
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
intelligence platform to automate that
 
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
and reduce potential human error and
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
time to deliver those reports and then
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
the the final one is external and
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
internal secure data portals and what
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is is we have an external portal
 
00:51:29.569 --> 00:51:29.579 align:start position:0%
for our public reports and we have
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
internal portals for our non-public
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
reports that are securing the
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
information but we need to further
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
enhance those and so what that 1.5
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
million does is essentially a pro it
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
gives the department the ability to
 
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
gives the department the ability to
Leverage

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
Leverage
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I call it like a Headhunter contract
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
where where we could
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
um Outsource the Consultants bring them
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
in train them through our security and
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
privacy best practices as as team
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
members to work on these different
 
00:51:58.319 --> 00:51:59.510 align:start position:0%
members to work on these different
systems

00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
the average rate on the current contract
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
that we're actually going to be going
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
out to RFP for another one the current
 
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
contract is about 125 an hour so that
 
00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
results in twelve thousand dollars over
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
um for those for those project managers
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
and business analysts across those those
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
projects those are a list of the
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
projects that we would be targeting
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
however we would anticipate that we'd be
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
able to pick up other projects as they
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
come on board
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
and they're really targeting two
 
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
platforms our Salesforce platform as
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
well as our Enterprise business
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.849 --> 00:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
so to anticipate our discussion in two
 
00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:42.170 align:start position:0%
so to anticipate our discussion in two
years

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
is this is 245
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
is this one time a one-time set of
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
projects or uh I I I listening to you it
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
sounds like uh the projects will be
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
worked and kind of feel like one and
 
00:52:58.740 --> 00:52:59.870 align:start position:0%
worked and kind of feel like one and
done

00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
but the capability of being able to do
 
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
this kind of business process
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
re-engineering and Alignment is probably
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
an ongoing function or mission of your
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
department and I'm I'm sort of asking
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm trying to figure out
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
should this really be an hb1 item it's
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
showing up as an hp2 item
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is a good point I mean our
 
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
long-term goal is to prove that this
 
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:30.140 align:start position:0%
solution can work and actually deliver
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
projects on time within a budget and
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
meet the business needs
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and then the the goal would be if
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's something that does work that we
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
would be submitting as an operating cost
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
in the future but I think we're really
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
in partnership with doit which is that
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
second section
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
um we're trying to prove out the concept
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
that many private sector organizations
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
have done where they Outsource these
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
resources bring them in to do those
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
quick hit projects and then let those
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
people go and only bring them on board
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
when you actually need to do the design
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
development and implementation
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
um the other component is to leverage
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
this to operationalize into our existing
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
doit infrastructure and DHA test
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
resources so from a maintenance and
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
operations perspective
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
our goal is to leverage our existing
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
staff to maintain and operate the
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
solutions but bring these Consultants
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
ins to do that enhancement the big the
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
big push for new Solutions on the
 
00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:37.549 align:start position:0%
big push for new Solutions on the
platforms

00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
platforms
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
okay so I want to separate a couple of
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
things with whether you use Consultants
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
or whether you use in-house staff to
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity to do the
 
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
business process re-engineering and the
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you're doing on the uh you said
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
Urt user interface team or something I
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what that acronym
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
means but
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
my apologies was Department of
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
Information Technology is what I meant
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
to say doit I I slurred my letters
 
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
together all right when I have bad
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
hearing okay so whether you you're doing
 
00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:14.420 align:start position:0%
it through contracts or through
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
employees is not the issue I'm looking
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
for here the issue I'm looking for is is
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
is is is this truly intended to be
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations and maintenance and
 
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
therefore something that should be an
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
hb1 or is this what I thought I heard
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
you say for a moment a a kind of a
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
business experiment to see if this adds
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
value and if it if it doesn't add value
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
we won't see it next term if it does add
 
00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
value you'll you'll be proposing it in
 
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.970 align:start position:0%
value you'll you'll be proposing it in
hb1

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
to address the business experiment
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
component that we do know that it will
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
add value in the sense that we do not
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
have the staff currently to be able to
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
achieve any of those projects on time or
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
within any legitimate budget right now
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
um and it would be taking our current
 
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
platform forward to be able to address
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
those projects effectively
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
but the reason why we didn't submit we
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
submitted this initially as I prioritize
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
need to our HP one budget because it was
 
00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:22.619 align:start position:0%
above and beyond our current budget
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that looking at it
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
saying well we have six targeted
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
projects that could be one-time project
 
00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:31.910 align:start position:0%
projects that could be one-time project
deliveries

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
deliveries
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
that I believe was a discussion of why
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
why I was moved into hb2 leveraging 23
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
surplus funds it is entirely possible as
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
you as you indicated Mr chair that
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
we would look at that into the next
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
biennium and say we really do need this
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
as an hb1 item to support the business
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
needs on an ongoing basis in the sales
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
force and the Enterprise business
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
intelligence platforms to continue to
 
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
deliver new projects as they arise and I
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
would fully anticipate requesting it
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
again in the next binding budget so so
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
if we have a high expectation that the
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
answer is yes I I this feels like an hb2
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
item except that we're trying to use FY
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
23 Surplus
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
sort of my summary did you have
 
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
something representative walner
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know if is there
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
Federal matching fund for this
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
yes there are
 
00:57:37.089 --> 00:57:37.099 align:start position:0%
um so for for Section 245
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
it is a 50 50 match
 
00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.569 align:start position:0%
it is a 50 50 match
um

00:57:41.569 --> 00:57:41.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
245. Mr chair is there a corresponding
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
budget book page on HP one that we can
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
see where this would have gone
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't mean to interrupt no no
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
you're right that's what I was trying to
 
00:58:04.490 --> 00:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
get to is where where would this be on
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
hb1 if it were in hb1 sure let me just
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
it would have been on page
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:06.589 align:start position:0%
 
79

00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:08.339 align:start position:0%
all right could I just ask what is the
 
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
47 also 247 also matched with federal
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
funds are both of those
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
so these aren't
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollar projects these are
 
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:24.420 align:start position:0%
three million dollar projects
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
so there is there is also a federal
 
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
so there is there is also a federal
match

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
match
 
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.289 align:start position:0%
match
um

00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
see I'm just doing some quick math it's
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
closer to
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
um approximately 66 percent General
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
funds 34 federal dollars that we're able
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
to leverage for that particular
 
00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
Initiative for the second one yes
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm on it took me a while I'm on
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
one page 1089 and and then where on that
 
00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.289 align:start position:0%
one page 1089 and and then where on that
page

00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
so it would most likely
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
um if it were to be included in hb1 it
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
would uh most likely be on the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
subsequent page in 1090 within class 102
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
contracts for program Services
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and or it could also be budgeted
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay so if we if we just were doing
 
01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:21.980 align:start position:0%
dealing with this
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
then the total source of funds instead
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
56.085 would be three million dollars
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
more just to account for HB 245.
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
and and the split is split on the 245 is
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
50 50. yes 50 50 on the 245 and then on
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:52.380 --> 01:01:00.289 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
so and and and Mr Wieters on on 247
 
01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
this is related to the hiring I.T
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
Consultants to develop and Implement
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
automated Solutions
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
this sounds extremely similar to 245
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
is it is it the same deal that you
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
you're choosing to contract this out and
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh because we've got some money
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
available and you can go contract it out
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
rather than hiring in-house you're
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
already convinced that this wants to be
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
an ongoing part of your capacity
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
to I think you have two questions
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
maybe three or four in there maybe three
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
or four so the two that I heard was one
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
is it looks very similar to section 245
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
and the difference is that this is for
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
the technical Component Resources so
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
data Wranglers sales or Salesforce
 
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
developers Salesforce Architects and
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
data analysts so it's rounding out the
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
whole team to be able to deliver these
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
different solutions it is the same
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
projects as representative Wallner
 
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier so it's a combined
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
solution but they needed to be submitted
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
as two separate items because one would
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
be a is really doit expenditure or
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
information technology expenditure the
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
other is a Health and Human Services
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
expenditure to have one complete team
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
and if I got this second question right
 
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes our goal is that
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
in in light of not having additional
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
staff added to to the um to the state
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
both the uit and DHHS to do this then
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
our alternative is to Outsource those
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
solutions to Consultants so so I
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
understand Outsourcing support the need
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
to do that I but it comes back to the
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
conversation we had earlier with the
 
01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
representative poll had some opinions on
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
this is that we we really ought to get
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
hb1 to reflect ongoing operations that
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
then the question gets to be if it's an
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 item strictly because this gives us
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
an easy vehicle for spending Surplus
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
from from the current fiscal year I I
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
would prefer
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
another alternative to getting it into
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
hb1 and still leveraging 23 revenues if
 
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
we can go ahead just one point of
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
consideration so so as Dave had
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier this is a prioritized
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
need and it's the first time we've ever
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
done something like this so so this is a
 
01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
new model and this isn't in response to
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
the some of the labor challenges that we
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
have had so
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have an opinion one way or
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
another but but I just I just want to
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
make that clear that we've never done
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
this we assume it's going to work that's
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
why we're doing it we don't necessarily
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
know if it's going to work but our
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
assumption is it will
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and and so it is a new initiative
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
um for for this biennium and we've never
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
we've never engaged in this specific
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
type of model so
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
we we don't have any real reason to
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
think it'll fail either the corporations
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
do this all the time they go out and
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
Outsource to augment their staff in a
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
temporary basis you know but but the but
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
the ongoing requirement to be able to do
 
01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
these sort of things is will last as
 
01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:29.339 align:start position:0%
long as we use I.T I think that's the
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
argument for finding a way to put it in
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
hb1 and the strongest argument for
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
keeping an hp2 is because it's an easy
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
way to spend down 23 Surplus
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
so what what I'd like to do is just ask
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
you guys who are you know the experts on
 
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
on correct budgeting how how do we get
 
01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
these expenses reflected in hb1 and
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
still spend HB
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
23 money or excuse me FY 23 money this
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
is the same thing as we said on mlmis
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
that we would just direct restricted
 
01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
um you could do that again I might
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
suggest not doing it repeatedly for all
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
of these Appropriations
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
um in fact in in the case of these two
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
specific Appropriations because they're
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
because they're so much smaller
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
3.5 million over the biennium you might
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
be able to just fund this out of 24.25
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
if you were so inclined
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
I I think I'd prefer that I just would
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
like to keep the books clean and and one
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the things that representative Mooney
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
asked me on offline that makes sense
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
um is it would be nice to see all of the
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
projects for which we're trying to take
 
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:55.700 align:start position:0%
FY 23 Surplus and spend it in the
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
24-25 does such a list exist somewhere
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
or would that have to be built
 
01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.450 align:start position:0%
or would that have to be built
separately

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
well the summary she yeah the the
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
document the representative tolersky has
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
I had sent out a house bill to summary
 
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
sheet that included general fund
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations across the three years so
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
if you still have that if not I can I
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
can print out more copies it shows
 
01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339 align:start position:0%
everything that's currently funded in
 
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm horrible with paper so I
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
dated March 2nd and we got it via email
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
and then I think we got a hard copy of
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit after okay what was
 
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
the document titled
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
um hb2 was introduced sorry Health and
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
Human Services related sections I'll
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
print out some hard copies now
 
01:06:42.539 --> 01:06:47.210 align:start position:0%
print out some hard copies now
three

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year Columns of allocations
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
so representative norgren what what what
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on this am I making
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
too big a deal out of putting stuff into
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
HP one for visibility and continuity do
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
you do you share my concern that we get
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
stuff out of hp2 and keep it in hb1 if
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
whichever way I think we would defer
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
them from the HHS to see how it works
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
for them and with Mr Ripple
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay so because this is a prioritized
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
need that didn't get picked up by the
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
governor and we're talking about it here
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
I I I think you could assume just the
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
general level of support
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
the issue here is is having hb1 be a
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
more meaningful document to the next
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
division three by putting stuff in there
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
that belongs in there what what are your
 
01:08:04.569 --> 01:08:04.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
from my perspective I I I mean we have
 
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
hb1 we have hb2
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
um there are certainly challenges
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
um as representative hole indicated
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
earlier when you're trying to understand
 
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
you know what are the costs associated
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
here what are the costs associated over
 
01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
here what are the costs associated over
here

01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I I would probably defer to the
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
committee as as that that really seems
 
01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
to be a policy question
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
um I think my priority is making sure
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
that we have the money to do what we
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
first rule of resource management is to
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
so this one and a half million in
 
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.150 align:start position:0%
so this one and a half million in
sections

01:08:43.150 --> 01:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:08:46.269 --> 01:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
245 right
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
240 yeah 245 247 for the 1.9 million
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate that that will be an
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
ongoing annual expense
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
if we put it into the budget right as a
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
one but it's a one-time
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
make changes
 
01:09:02.819 --> 01:09:04.070 align:start position:0%
make changes
that

01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
ramps up the budget unnecessarily for
 
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
the following year if it's if it truly
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
is a one-time expense
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
even if it's labor as a one-time expense
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's different than if it's going to
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
be ongoing could could I try responding
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
which I responding to his question go
 
01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:22.789 align:start position:0%
which I responding to his question go
ahead

01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
so I think what they've been saying is
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
this a new approach I want to try for
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
doing some extra development there's
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
always going to be a need for extra
 
01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.749 align:start position:0%
always going to be a need for extra
development

01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
if it works out that this extra
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
development methodology works
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
the next cycle when they still have more
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
new development they would put into the
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
budget as new development but it'd be in
 
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
the budget and yes it probably would be
 
01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:48.179 align:start position:0%
an ongoing expense going forward it
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
might vary in terms of dollars it might
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
not always be fixed like you would for
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
for other areas of the business model
 
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
but I think that's what I heard them
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for summarizing it yes
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative that would be how how I
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
would answer the question
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and if I could just add if we're going
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
to keep it in hp2 which actually I'm not
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
a versa doing I would kind of see the
 
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
descriptions of the projects in hb2 just
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
so we have I I was I thought it was an
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation of what they're
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
doing with it I'd like to kind of see
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
that in here so other people so when we
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
sell it to the house they can we can say
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.169 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
just so I'm Mr chair go ahead
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative I would agree with Mr
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
Earth that
 
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.590 align:start position:0%
Earth that
Representatives

01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
whoever you are today
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
um that that we tread so the public
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
knows what we're doing and we don't just
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
have it a line item in the budget so I
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
think that's important to be transparent
 
01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:56.689 align:start position:0%
think that's important to be transparent
I

01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
I agree with both of you that that would
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
be better than what hb2 does now I I'm
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
just finding myself obsessing on wanting
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
to put
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations and things that are
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to be budgeted next cycle
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
into hb2 when they feel like they want
 
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
to live in hb1
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
and respond so I guess my point there is
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
they've done it this way for an initial
 
01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:24.950 align:start position:0%
they've done it this way for an initial
approach

01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
I think making it transparent in hp2 is
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
actually better for this initial
 
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.290 align:start position:0%
actually better for this initial
approach

01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:29.300 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
next time it needs to be one let them
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
come and sell to us why remember it's
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
just going to be numbers in HP one
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
come and sell to assume presentations
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
how they're going to sell that to us at
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
I believe I heard
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
Mr White say it could be under Section
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
hold on 046 for a budget right
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
Consultants is one of the options for
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of this
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
or contracts for program services but if
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm on page 1090 right if we put it
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
under the that portion of the budget it
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
becomes clear that this is outside work
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
that is short-term in nature that is
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
right and now the justification for
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
future Consulting needs to come back
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
next year why do I need right what other
 
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
programs am I doing
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
so so yes we we would most likely
 
01:12:35.219 --> 01:12:35.930 align:start position:0%
so so yes we we would most likely
um

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
budget that uh in in in the future in in
 
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
a in a 102 if if those funds are
 
01:12:41.699 --> 01:12:43.070 align:start position:0%
a in a 102 if if those funds are
provided

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.330 align:start position:0%
provided
yeah

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
102 or but what's the difference so
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
for my understanding what's the
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
difference between 046 category and one
 
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.390 align:start position:0%
difference between 046 category and one
102.

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
102.
 
01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.250 align:start position:0%
102.
right

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
so generally speaking most a large
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
portion of our contracts are are
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
budgeted under 102 you'll also many of
 
01:13:05.689 --> 01:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
the conversations we've had
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
um we we also have mentioned the class
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
74 for the those sub-recipients we use
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
Consultants less frequently normally
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
it's for very kind of limited services
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
and we use that more in the it realm you
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
won't see that line really used in any
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
of the other program areas as as those
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
areas more so have like your traditional
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
so just one of the other components is
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's a transfer to oit
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
um line item in that same I think it's
 
01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.030 align:start position:0%
um line item in that same I think it's
on

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
class 27 line 27 there so in there when
 
01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
we when we put it through the doit
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
budget when we do that transfer they
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually have a a class line detail and
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
we use class 46 for the Consultants on
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
that site so like as Mr White indicated
 
01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
the when it comes to the 1.95 million
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
that is in the hb2 that would normally
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
be in the transfer to oit
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then budgeted in class 46 to hire
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
Consultants the 1.5 would stay in our
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
class 102 for contracts because of the
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
way we we go out and get the contract
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
and then we would have it in class 102.
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
so my understanding was 102 was
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
allocated when we're hiring somebody out
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
on the outside to deliver a service to a
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
person and I maybe I would I
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I was thinking Consultants
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
are delivering services to the
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
department same as like the doit side
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
it it could be used either way
 
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.470 align:start position:0%
it it could be used either way
representative

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's okay I just wanted to comment now
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we've this document you guys have
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
seen the 2023 expense there's
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's not like there's a laundry list of
 
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
things that we haven't seen yet I think
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed last week and
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
this morning the items that have 2023
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
funds so
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
um I guess we're talking about the mmis
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
issue and then
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
um what's on page 81 are the only two so
 
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
I guess it's it's not a bigger
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
ball of yarn
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
do I have that correct okay making sure
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
and it's clearly not a bigger ball of
 
01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.450 align:start position:0%
and it's clearly not a bigger ball of
yarn

01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
yarn
 
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.850 align:start position:0%
yarn
great

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:48.860 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
thanks so so I I I think we've uh we're
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
done because we've spent as much time as
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
this is worth and in conclusion
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
I think that it may be just less motion
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
if we leave hb2 item fundamentally these
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
two hb2 items fundamentally alone other
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
than providing the extra detail so we
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
can take Mr weeder's Project list that
 
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
he read verbally and include it so that
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
there's a better audit trail of what we
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
we bought this cycle and so then when
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
they come back in two years to whoever's
 
01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
in this room they there there's there's
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit more history that we can
 
01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.450 align:start position:0%
a little bit more history that we can
follow

01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:37.460 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:40.340 align:start position:0%
representative you'll agree with that
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay representative nordgren you agree
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
with that okay
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
do you have an issue with that Mr Ripple
 
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
no nope okay so those were your three
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
things Mr Wieters did you have a fourth
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
thing that you wanted to talk about
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%

back thank you thank you for having me
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for going through this process
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
all right who Mr Ripple do you want to
 
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
walk us through 254 sure so 254
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
appropriates funds to support Family
 
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
Resource Center infrastructure it's a
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars each in 24 and 25.
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
can can we I need a basic education what
 
01:18:05.169 --> 01:18:05.179 align:start position:0%
what is exactly a Family Resource Center
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
so I I can
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
um if it's helpful I can as we go
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
through hp2 and if there's any other
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
questions I can have the the program
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
area come down and provide you all the
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
information you'd like on that tomorrow
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
um but but I can definitely follow up
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
with a very clear explanation I don't
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
want to bungle the answer all right
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's that that's an email with a
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
sentence okay a Family Resource Center
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
is defined as and then whatever the
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
email works and I you know I think I did
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
have a a stray fourth question from Mr
 
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.250 align:start position:0%
have a a stray fourth question from Mr
Wieters

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
Wieters
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
you st you're still here right you
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
haven't checked out on us just yet
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay this was something that came up
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with e-verify and whether or
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
not the new heights system already had
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
the capability to process eligibility
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
using e-verify as a confirmatory Source
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
two answers to that question one is
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
e-verify it as the e-verify.gov we don't
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
go through that but we do do address
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
verification and we do multiple threads
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
of verification for the integrated
 
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility but we are looking we are
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
still seeking out through the
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
that specific New Heights team to see if
 
01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
we go to e-verify.gov to address that
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
but we do everything that e-verify.gov
 
01:19:55.570 --> 01:19:55.580 align:start position:0%
does through our other third-party
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
contracts for address verification and
 
01:19:59.219 --> 01:20:00.770 align:start position:0%
contracts for address verification and
um

01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
I would say we we leverage Federal
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer information to make sure that
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
we have the right taxpayer as well as
 
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
our Social Security Administration feed
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have the right Social
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
Security information so we we do
 
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
multiple Avenues of verification for the
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
new height system oh okay so I want to
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand precisely what
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
if we took all of the population of New
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's running through
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
New Heights
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
doing all the verifications that we do
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
for eligibility we would come out with
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
the exact same results as if we had done
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
that in e-verify because they're the
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:52.340 align:start position:0%
I would have to verify that statement
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
I have an inquiry out with the team and
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
and I should have an answer by the end
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
of the day for the for the committee
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
all right thanks uh representative hole
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
if if it's fair game to ask questions
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
right I have a question regarding
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
um time sheets and what is captured
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
within the IT department side of things
 
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
and if you're not the right person to
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
ask this please say so is there a
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
current process in place to allocate the
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
3100 employees time of which roughly 3
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
000 are hourly to what projects they're
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
working on
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
already within the system yes so we have
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
a federally approved we we call it a a
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
pay cap it's our Public Assistance cost
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
allocation plan it's several hundred
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
pages long
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and we use a variety of mechanisms to
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
track individuals time that is not you
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
now we don't track that like within the
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
state uh timekeeping system we have to
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
do that separately we have hundreds of
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
job numbers that we use to tie specific
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
sources of funds to specific uses and
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a pretty complex behind the
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
scenes system that we use to capture
 
01:22:09.770 --> 01:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
that in order to leverage as many
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
federal dollars as we can I can
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
certainly share that that um the the the
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
approved the pay cap with you if you'd
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know I I think I think there's
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
enough interest in the project
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
accounting of personnel time that I'd
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
like to add it as a special topic to
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
have you come back on someday but I I
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
want to I don't think that it's critical
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
to the immediate budget work that we're
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
doing it's more of a a good background
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
item and and and when we do crossover I
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
don't know if the Senate keeps you as
 
01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:50.900 align:start position:0%
busy as we do
 
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
if they keep you as busy as we do then
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll figure out when we can do it
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
but but I think I would like a special
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
session on that
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay the Senate phase is is challenging
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
so even if it were in January you know
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
we could we we could wait I just think
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's a good special topic that we
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
ought to understand better sure all
 
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.770 align:start position:0%
ought to understand better sure all
right

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Wieters you really are
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
excuse now so thank you again appreciate
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
it run yeah and don't don't sit down in
 
01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.950 align:start position:0%
it run yeah and don't don't sit down in
here

01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
all right uh where were we on 254 before
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
well if you're done with 254
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
um no I think I just wanted a definition
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
so what's what's the stew it
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
appropriates a million dollars each year
 
01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:46.780 align:start position:0%
in general funds
 
01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:52.370 align:start position:0%
in general funds
[Music]

01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
how did how did this is this the
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
governor's hb2 proposal or did this come
 
01:23:59.570 --> 01:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else this past
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislative session SB 444 had
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
appropriated a million dollars for
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
um in state fiscal year 23 as a
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
um consequently we
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
we requested to continue to fund that at
 
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.450 --> 01:24:25.460 align:start position:0%
it's an existing account do do you have
 
01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.070 align:start position:0%
it's an existing account do do you have
7216

01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
7216
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
what patreon
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what page it is but it's
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
account number 7216 and hb1 if I'm not
 
01:24:32.699 --> 01:24:38.050 align:start position:0%
account number 7216 and hb1 if I'm not
mistaken

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's that that's the kinship Grant
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
um account within the Bureau of family
 
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.729 align:start position:0%
um account within the Bureau of family
assistance

01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
that I have the account number right is
 
01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
I I would need to go back and verify
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
that the the amounts don't don't show up
 
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
there but it's not clear to me whether
 
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's showing up in the adjusted
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
authorize it wouldn't appear to be
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
do you have any issues with this are you
 
01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with the h32
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Northern are you
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this hp2 yes all right
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
okay so next
 
01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.149 align:start position:0%
okay so next
255.

01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.159 --> 01:25:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
is this the same thing as Meals on
 
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.649 align:start position:0%
is this the same thing as Meals on
Wheels

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
Wheels
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
I I I I see nutrition in transportation
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
services and then I get emails talking
 
01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
about Meals on Wheels is this are these
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
the same thing yes this would support
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
those contracts
 
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
so so the allegation in the emails is
 
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
generally that were funding Meals on
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
Wheels at a lower rate than we did in
 
01:25:45.169 --> 01:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
the current year
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
if we approve this if we approve what's
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
in HP one
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
so if you approve this
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
um this hb2 appropriation here that
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
would give us funds sufficient to
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
maintain current service levels and
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
rates can you take us to the page number
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
where these are at because I think I
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
found them once and there were two line
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
items and it looked like uh from 23 they
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
just so you know I have a hard break at
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
noon and we'll take a recess at noon for
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
a while uh oh I see a grimace
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
are we going to come back yeah it's a
 
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
recess we'll come back from one to two
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
or I you know I I only need 30 minutes
 
01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:20.699 align:start position:0%
at noon uh if you guys want longer than
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
30 minutes then we can come back along
 
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
you know later
 
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:58.189 align:start position:0%
 
we're

01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.199 --> 01:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:16.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
yeah if you
 
01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:20.689 align:start position:0%
yeah if you
um

01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
01:28:31.729 --> 01:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
account seven eight seven two
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the class lines that you're
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
referring to representative erwort
 
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.189 align:start position:0%
referring to representative erwort
Edwards

01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
Edwards
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
um we we actually submitted a change
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
request that I believe Kevin has
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
um to to con to combine the home
 
01:29:04.010 --> 01:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
delivered into the home delivered in
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
congregate because currently
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
um we we pay the home delivered meals
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
okay so you're you're proposing
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
541 and 544 get merged into one line
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
into 541 correct
 
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.750 align:start position:0%
into 541 correct
okay

01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.649 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is uh so the observation that
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
the the governor's recommended budget is
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
flat relative to 23 is accurate
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
and then this 3.4 million a year in hb2
 
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
this is in addition to a base of of the
 
01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:57.709 align:start position:0%
this is in addition to a base of of the
um

01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
5.5 million so so now we're talking
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
about 9 million or so total per year
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
um there are a few other
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
class lines there's a few other accounts
 
01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
that we pay for
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
for Meals on Wheels out of
 
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.050 align:start position:0%
for Meals on Wheels out of
um

01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:20.209 --> 01:30:20.219 align:start position:0%
would it be more effective if I get a
 
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
listing of those accounts the total
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
dollars and get that get that to you in
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
in detail or I can go through this here
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
now it may take me a couple minutes I
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
think that would help me because of the
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
direct questions and allegations that
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
we've we're cutting money and
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
um and and so I'd like to I'd like to
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
understand the allegation we'll go ahead
 
01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
I might have a explanation for that okay
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
is it possible that arpa slash covid
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
funds during this current biennium have
 
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
been used in this account on top of the
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
what's currently in the budget for H for
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
our current biennium yeah so we um we
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
had utilized arpa funds for for a uh a
 
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.310 align:start position:0%
had utilized arpa funds for for a uh a
rate

01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
increase during during the the the the
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
current biennium and and so these funds
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
are meant to replace that representative
 
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
Wallner had previously asked about what
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
are the areas where we were using arpa
 
01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
funds and now we're using general funds
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
this and Hampstead are the two primary
 
01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:25.129 align:start position:0%
this and Hampstead are the two primary
areas

01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.169 --> 01:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
any other comments go ahead
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I just remember
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
when we were discussing this division
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there were Meals on Wheels line
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
items sort of all over the place like
 
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
four different can you just give me a 30
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
second explanation of why that is is it
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
because oops sorry it's because of that
 
01:31:44.219 --> 01:31:45.470 align:start position:0%
because oops sorry it's because of that
they

01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
have different
 
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
um deliverers or or so so we try to what
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
we do um we call them braided or Blended
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
contracts where we use multiple funding
 
01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.310 align:start position:0%
contracts where we use multiple funding
sources

01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and in our accounts we you know
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a hundred percent federal
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
funds so we may account for like ssbg
 
01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
funds in one account another account we
 
01:32:07.739 --> 01:32:08.510 align:start position:0%
funds in one account another account we
may

01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
um have a maybe a 50 50 match another
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
account maybe 100 General funds and what
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
um when we enter into a contract we try
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
to leverage as many of those funds and
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
those dollars that are allowable into
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
that single contract so what the
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council will see
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
is they'll see a request enter into a
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
contract and then underneath it they'll
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
see the accounting detail and they'll
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
see all four or five or six accounts
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
that feed into that total price
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
limitation okay that makes sense thank
 
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
limitation okay that makes sense thank
you

01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay so um if if we do this hb2 item for
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
3.4 million what what is the federal
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
I believe it would be 50 50 but let me
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
verify let me put together a document
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
for the committee that that has all of
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
the the detail here and then the other
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
question of the day is um
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
why aren't we just showing this in hb1
 
01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
if we expect this to be an ongoing
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
expense every year
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
we submitted this as a prioritized needs
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
request originally
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
because it was new or because the
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
increment was new I I'm confused by the
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
term new I apologize because the
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
increase was it was over the three
 
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
percent so again when we submitted our
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
budget for say fiscal year 24 we had to
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
fit all of our general funds within a
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
three percent increase over over the 23
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized okay all right did
 
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
any questions on the right nope the left
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
is ready the right is ready
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
iron line is clear
 
01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:33:52.739 --> 01:33:53.689 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
I I I think I'm ready to talk about 256.
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
okay 256 appropriates funds to increase
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay if we were to convert this to a
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
percentage what percentage are we using
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
in general and then is do we also have a
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
sense of what that does it's sort of an
 
01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
individual family rate a percentage
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
increase or so so we had based this
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
request on the median Inc income
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
household it was previously on on the
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
low income household
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I can I don't have that figure
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
available but I can get that to you and
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
and the um this request was made to try
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
to make those rates more consistent and
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't think competitive is a right
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
word but perhaps more consistent with
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
the individuals that that are
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
did did we get a briefing that I'm just
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
forgetting or maybe I skipped over the
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
page that said how many foster care
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
families were currently serving how many
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh cases are being unmet or wait listed
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
and and what what the typical
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates are for those foster
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
families that feels like a graphic that
 
01:35:17.290 --> 01:35:17.300 align:start position:0%
we should have had
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
I can check what Joe provided you and he
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
presented for the division for children
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
youth and families but I don't recall an
 
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
explicit conversation on that because if
 
01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:29.219 align:start position:0%
we had a graphic like that then I would
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
just come back and and say can we can we
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
put this hb2 into context of that so
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we can see how much what percent
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
particularly the percentage if if we're
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
going if we're going to be looking for
 
01:35:45.169 --> 01:35:45.179 align:start position:0%
other Medicaid procedure codes and I
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
know this is not a Medicaid procedure
 
01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:49.139 align:start position:0%
code I get that but I think if we're
 
01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:51.179 align:start position:0%
going to try to raise some rates
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere we need to understand
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
what kind of percentage we're
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
go ahead you know I'm looking at page 14
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
of the oh I'm looking at page 14 on the
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh director's office
 
01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:16.390 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh director's office
um

01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
briefing book I guess they have foster
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
care includes license relative
 
01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
care includes license relative
placements

01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.689 align:start position:0%
placements
projected

01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
and they've foster care in residential
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
were broken out so out through 2025
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
and Source through TANF and title IV but
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
um you know foster care average cost per
 
01:36:46.129 --> 01:36:46.139 align:start position:0%
case it's saying
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh residential it's 59 000 in
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
2024 so I'm guessing that number is
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
before this adjustment and we're looking
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
01:37:02.890 --> 01:37:02.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.729 align:start position:0%
 
individuals

01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:37:04.739 --> 01:37:06.350 align:start position:0%
individuals
so

01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that helps it does
 
01:37:12.890 --> 01:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
what's your conclusion what what do you
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
get a sense of a percentage increase
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with
 
01:37:19.570 --> 01:37:19.580 align:start position:0%
uh looks like 20 maybe
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
20 percent that above the 59 000 okay it
 
01:37:29.450 --> 01:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:30.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
and says average cost per case maybe
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
sorry you know trying to read and
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
move the book move the microphone move
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
my head
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
something uh so
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm not not sure what
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
percentage increase so I think we can
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
come off a subject unless there are
 
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
other questions because I think Mr White
 
01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to try to re-summarize this
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
so that we have
 
01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of some backing to put 256
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
into context
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:09.530 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions when that's got a
 
01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions when that's got a
257.

01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
257.
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
section 257 this is the 17 million per
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
year of General funds to increase
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid provider rates is this is this
 
01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
when we say it's the 3.1 percent is that
 
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.209 align:start position:0%
when we say it's the 3.1 percent is that
this

01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
it is this although the section itself
 
01:38:29.689 --> 01:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
does not reference a specific rate
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
increase but yes but but that's how we
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
got to 17 million this is basically 3.1
 
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.590 align:start position:0%
got to 17 million this is basically 3.1
percent

01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
Okay so
um

01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham while you were
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
out we committed you to talking tomorrow
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
to tell us what
 
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:52.139 align:start position:0%
progress you have been able to make
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
towards identifying what kind of
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
um procedure codes we might be looking
 
01:38:59.890 --> 01:38:59.900 align:start position:0%
at and what kind of
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
potential rate adjustments that we could
 
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
make on a limited targeted basis
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
well you know I'm happy to talk at any
 
01:39:13.010 --> 01:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
time that's that's why I'm here the
 
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:16.970 align:start position:0%
um but um
uh

01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's way ways to look at
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
these things the primary way I think
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at things is that
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
the kind of the more Global level like
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
each separate fee schedule is maybe
 
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
being prioritized one over another
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps on on the impact of overall care
 
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
perhaps on on the impact of overall care
um

01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know we we did look uh have have uh
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
some fee schedules brought in
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
um with like the physician fee schedule
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
and for example they listed the top uh
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
80 build codes and for those that about
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
half of them have have a good
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
comparative value which might be
 
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.610 align:start position:0%
comparative value which might be
Medicare

01:39:57.610 --> 01:39:57.620 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
and you know half of them don't there's
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
services that are not provided under the
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare benefits program and
 
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.689 align:start position:0%
Medicare benefits program and
um

01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know I think part of the part of the
 
01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh that there are some services that
 
01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:19.940 align:start position:0%
seem to be short and seem to be
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
dramatically below the Medicare
 
01:40:24.169 --> 01:40:24.179 align:start position:0%
Benchmark rate you know if we had to
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
start from scratch uh forever you know
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rates which are highly
 
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.510 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rates which are highly
um

01:40:34.510 --> 01:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
vetted the the process is to reset
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare physician fee schedules and
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
Hospital outpatient and Ambulatory
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers and inpatient rates are
 
01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:48.770 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers and inpatient rates are
are

01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:53.060 align:start position:0%
are quite extensive and um
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
and at least some some of the things in
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
here seem seem a little bit random as
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
random as having a 3.1 percent increase
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
which from everything you know now now a
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks into this everything
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
I've heard it just seems like it was a
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
dart on a dartboard is anybody here
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
anything any different than that
 
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
I I've I've heard that they've been
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
throwing darts at this for over a decade
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
and and that just like when you're
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
wandering in the woods if you're if your
 
01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
asthma is off just a little bit by the
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
time you get
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know 10 miles out you're really far
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
from where you want to be I think that's
 
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
sort of what's happened and I think the
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
department is committed to spending the
 
01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
reset on Medicaid recommendations on
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
what their rates ought to be
 
01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
what what we what what I thought that we
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
were all aligned on doing was to see if
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
there are some particular rates that are
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
are critical that really need to be
 
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
adjusted and fixed in this budget and
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
although it's not a hundred percent it's
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
probably just a kind of a a quick and
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
dirty thing because of the time and
 
01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
expertise involved that something is
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
better than nothing if there are a few
 
01:42:24.169 --> 01:42:24.179 align:start position:0%
things that we think are in crisis that
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
we can reach in and try to you know
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the chaos that would be good and
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
that's and that's sort of what I'm
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
hoping to get from you if if uh but
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
you're the expert so I'm looking forward
 
01:42:38.209 --> 01:42:38.219 align:start position:0%
to whatever you have to present us
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay that's
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Anon Anan
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
I I think this is one of the major
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
topics you you've been listening and
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
tracking is there anything for the good
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the division that you want to share
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't have to move Mr
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
White just just come come on up I'd love
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
good morning Stephen and president
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association uh for the record
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
um so we've been obviously following
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
this discussion relative to Medicaid
 
01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
rates uh for a while Medicaid rate
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has historically paid
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the cost of
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
providing care New Hampshire's Medicaid
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
rates have often been some of the lowest
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
um we've been very appreciative of the
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
rate increase that was Institute a
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
couple years ago we were appreciative of
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
the rate increase that was provided to
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
birthing Services uh last year
 
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
this year what we are advocating is we
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the governors across the
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
board rate increase suggestion
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
um but we don't believe that is what is
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
necessary at this time and are focusing
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
are in our efforts to
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases for Behavioral
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
Health Services as well as post-acute
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
services like long-term care skilled
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities Home and Community
 
01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
Services those are two of the areas that
 
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
we're having the most difficulty right
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
now getting patients out of a hospital
 
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
patients who don't need to be in the
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
hospital particularly those who you know
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
have been medically cleared and are
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
ready to go to their next level of care
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
we can't get them out because those
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
other facilities don't have the staff to
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
be able to accept those patients so a
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
more robust uh you know Medicaid rate
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
for those providers would give them the
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
predictability to be able to know that
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
they can hire those staff to serve those
 
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
patients so from our perspective we
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
think you know much more targeted rate
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
increases in those particular areas are
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
what is called for at this time not I'm
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
not asking for rate increases for
 
01:44:51.649 --> 01:44:51.659 align:start position:0%
hospitals at this time because again the
 
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
most important thing we can do is help
 
01:44:55.609 --> 01:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
the system move the patient to the best
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
place where they can get the care that
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
they need
 
01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's completely consistent with what
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the New Hampshire
 
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
hospital for example the the that their
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
issue is there's nowhere to send a
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
patient upon discharge and so you're
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
having that same problem so you'd
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
recommend we try to mitigate that
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
bottleneck absolutely
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
are there are there any questions here
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions I I
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
just asked you up I don't I'm happy to
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
do so all right
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
um so what's the financial impact on a
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
hospital of having a patient they can't
 
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.570 align:start position:0%
hospital of having a patient they can't
discharge

01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
um continue to collect funds above costs
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
below costs or none at all so um when a
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
patient is no longer
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
receiving a medically necessary service
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the hospital they're no longer being
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for that
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
um under Medicare we get paid a drg we
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
get so we get paid a set amount for a
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
certain procedure whether that patient
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
stays in there four days or 40 days or
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
400 Days we're getting the same payment
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
rate so it's really you know a
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
significant challenge because obviously
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
discharge them to another location for
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
the care that they need you can't bring
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
another patient in who needs that level
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
of care and obviously
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know that's a patient that you're
 
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
not receiving reimbursement for so it's
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
a significant implication for for
 
01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.970 align:start position:0%
a significant implication for for
hospitals

01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
are there Senate bills that are going
 
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
through the present time that would
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
address the particular rates you're
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
talking about here so there are Senate
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
bill um 86 as well as Senate Bill 36 um
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
or two bills that we are following and
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
working closely with folks on that side
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
of the the the the capital
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
um and uh obviously
 
01:46:47.689 --> 01:46:47.699 align:start position:0%
work over here in the house and so we
 
01:46:49.129 --> 01:46:49.139 align:start position:0%
understand where things are here but yes
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
we are working those two bills over
 
01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:53.810 align:start position:0%
we are working those two bills over
there

01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with those what what do
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
those do to do and are they redundant
 
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
with what you you represent or do you
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
think they're redundant with what I've
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
been asking representative Stringham to
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that I can't even speak
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
to what these do I just know I've heard
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
these mentioned before in similar
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
context I just bringing that up again
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
and actually I might suggest I mean
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
obviously if he could provide particular
 
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
rates that'd be very helpful also I
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
think Mr lippman is a guy to ask as well
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of your question about which
 
01:47:25.729 --> 01:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
ones are the most critical I think he
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
and the hospital Association and others
 
01:47:30.590 --> 01:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
and that of that knowledge base are the
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
would be good ones to ask you know you
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
know I have asked Mr Lipman and I don't
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
know what the status of his response is
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
do you miss Roy do you know he'll be
 
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
here tomorrow morning
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
um to to talk Medicare rates and hold an
 
01:47:46.030 --> 01:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
answer for you then
 
01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.810 align:start position:0%
answer for you then
okay

01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
in terms of Representative Waller I
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
wondered um if other people had seen the
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
email from Jim Monahan
 
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
it went to all of us
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
did other people not see it
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah he has he he huh what's the
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
summary can you can you give us it was
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
it was
um

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
can I sort of an outline that I think it
 
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
might be used in um
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 86 of sort of a summary of
 
01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.139 align:start position:0%
rate and rate increases that were being
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
suggested in that bill is your sense
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we're doing something redundant
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
that the Senate has taken on as a
 
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
specific project by asking
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham to put together
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
a special list for us of things that we
 
01:48:41.810 --> 01:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
could hit in hb2 I I don't I don't know
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
when you just walked in but but I I if
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
if the Senate is addressing what I
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to try to address
 
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
in terms of identifying some procedures
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
that were particular underwater that
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
were creating substantial risks then
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
I I think it would be really
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
good for this committee to hear from Mr
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
Monahan and from the people who've
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
worked on that summary of um rate
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
increases and I think because they have
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
reasons for why they're suggesting
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if uh this does anyone have
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
them on their bat phone that we could
 
01:49:27.050 --> 01:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
call and ask them to come in tomorrow
 
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
any anyone in that kind of coordination
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
I could ask him to come in tomorrow all
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
um so just to summarize he he sent us a
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet with about 13 rate
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
categories uh things like a nursing Aid
 
01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
and uh they have recommendations with no
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
no real description of of uh of the
 
01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
rationale for it but they do have a
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
specific list that they think would be
 
01:49:58.850 --> 01:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
helpful to the Medicaid Program so I
 
01:50:00.050 --> 01:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
think it would be great to hear from
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
them so did to as you looked at that
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
list and you've been thinking about this
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
sort of independently and getting some
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
other feedback did the items on the list
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
look familiar like there's a consistent
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
theme or was it something totally
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
different to quote Monty Python uh
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
I would say it's it's closer to the
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
latter because uh they they you can't
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily even tell which fee schedule
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
they fit under you know an individual
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
server service item so
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:38.629 align:start position:0%
 
nope

01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
all right well uh I thank you very much
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you just willing to come up
 
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
and talk to us with this sort of
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
Engagement with the community it just
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
makes it a lot easier for us to get
 
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
closer to being right when we get done
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I think we're at 276 oh no that's an
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
attorney general is that us that's not
 
01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:03.950 align:start position:0%
attorney general is that us that's not
us

01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
or not it is not the next sex the next
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
section is 282 and 283 on page 89 and
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
those amend statutory requirements for
 
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
hospitals applying for designation as
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
so 282 and 283. did we talk about this
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
these uh just briefly the other day when
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
I asked the opinion of the hospital
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
Association and we had the discussion
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
that this is probably
 
01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:49.669 align:start position:0%
that this is probably
inappropriate

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
my conclusion was that this is sort of
 
01:51:55.970 --> 01:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
inappropriate because we're we're
 
01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:57.229 align:start position:0%
inappropriate because we're we're
directing

01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
directing
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
the hospitals
 
01:52:03.649 --> 01:52:03.659 align:start position:0%
to allocate their private resources to a
 
01:52:06.169 --> 01:52:06.179 align:start position:0%
particular clinical priority that we
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
have but given our Workforce issues
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to rob Peter to
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
pay Paul and so in trying to solve a
 
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
problem we're going to likely create a
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
different problem that that's my summary
 
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:22.580 align:start position:0%
of what we heard in testimony
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
representative I just had a question for
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
the representative from the hospitals
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
possibly which is if you're well if you
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
interested in coming up I think we have
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
if you could remind us
 
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.990 align:start position:0%
if you could remind us
what

01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
the timeline is that we're talking about
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the Court's requesting a
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
solution for this problem and it was my
 
01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:53.219 align:start position:0%
understanding that perhaps
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
the deadline for that solution was going
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
to come before our work was done here so
 
01:52:59.930 --> 01:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you could explain
 
01:53:01.729 --> 01:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
that again
 
01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
um so again Steven Hospital Association
 
01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.030 align:start position:0%
um so again Steven Hospital Association
president

01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the court did uh issue their order on
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
February 23rd
 
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and gave the parties uh the hospitals
 
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
in the state 30 days to come back
 
01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
um with either a joint solution uh to uh
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
this issue or if not a joint solution
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
then separate uh potential solution so
 
01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:25.739 align:start position:0%
sometime at the end of this month
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
um I haven't counted 30 days from the
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
23rd but sometime at the end of this
 
01:53:29.159 --> 01:53:31.550 align:start position:0%
23rd but sometime at the end of this
month

01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
so so what do you think the implication
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
of that is representative that that we
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
don't need 282 or 283 because they're
 
01:53:46.430 --> 01:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to be overcome by larger events or
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
you are you suggesting that we'll be
 
01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
better informed on these two items when
 
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
we see the solution proposed
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
call me a pessimist
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
but I question if a agreeable solution
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
is going to come to light
 
01:54:06.370 --> 01:54:06.380 align:start position:0%
with by that time of that 30 days
 
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there could be an
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
extension or a delay I guess I just
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
that side and perhaps how hard they
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
might be working on a solution so that
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
we could then understand
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
if the need is um
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
as severe on our end to come up with
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
solution to try to decide if this is a
 
01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:31.370 align:start position:0%
solution to try to decide if this is a
section

01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:54:35.209 --> 01:54:35.219 align:start position:0%
that we go to the mat for and not in
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that made any sense it
 
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
kind of does i i i i i i there's no
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
money associated with these two items
 
01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
right Mr Ripple I don't see any money
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
this is simply
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
doing the work of a policy Committee in
 
01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:53.510 align:start position:0%
doing the work of a policy Committee in
hb2

01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
without an explicit set of hearings to
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
consider all of the implications this is
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's true that its policy and has no
 
01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:13.310 align:start position:0%
it's true that its policy and has no
money

01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.649 --> 01:55:15.659 align:start position:0%
I'm listening for your wisdom
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
well personally I would favor taking
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
these sections out I feel like the
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and the
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
administration have a job to do to get
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
together and
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
work out what works for both but to put
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
this in-house Bill too just seems like
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate place and it puts us
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
sort of in the middle
 
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
of a negotiation that we're really not
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
part of at this point and
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe they'll come back to
 
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.470 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe they'll come back to
us

01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
or to the Senate
 
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:48.649 align:start position:0%
or to the Senate
um

01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
once they come to an agreement with
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
something that they will need in House
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
Bill too
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
and the Senate would presumably put that
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
in and we would then either agree or not
 
01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
agree but this doesn't it seems like
 
01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's just not a good idea to have this
 
01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.310 align:start position:0%
it's just not a good idea to have this
here

01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
different rationale similar
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
comment there is no money associated
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
with this it is clearly more of a health
 
01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:17.780 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
policy decision not a budget item
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
um it would be better in my opinion that
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
a non-germaine amendment to another bill
 
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
going through HHS here if you're going
 
01:56:33.129 --> 01:56:33.139 align:start position:0%
to do this do it that way as opposed to
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
railroading this through on a budget so
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm willing to take it out so so I'm
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
a little slow on the uptake because I I
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
have recently become aware that I think
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
it was division one
 
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
sent over to e DNA all of the oplc part
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
of hp2 for them to take a look at I
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
wonder if I should have sent these two
 
01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
items over to HHS to see if they wanted
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
to come back with any kind of
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
recommendation on this
 
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree with that I mean
 
01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's no money in it I mean there's no
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
reason we have to have an opinion on
 
01:57:24.239 --> 01:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
reason we have to have an opinion on
this

01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
so Mr Ripple I don't know how to I don't
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
know how to do that division one just
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
did it with Edna I don't know what the
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
procedure was to to pass the item over
 
01:57:37.490 --> 01:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
to look for input but if we could do
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
something similar I would add it hey
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
my God your timing is good
 
01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
so so we're talking about a couple hb2
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
items with no money associated with them
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
directing significant Health Care policy
 
01:57:57.169 --> 01:57:57.179 align:start position:0%
from the governor's recommendation it's
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
statutory language I I would like to
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
send it over to HHS for you all to
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
consider from a policy perspective and I
 
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
I maybe give us some advice I don't know
 
01:58:11.209 --> 01:58:11.219 align:start position:0%
what that looks like though Mr Ripple
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
was about to explain how division one
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
just did that the Edna
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.570 --> 01:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
a representative go ahead all we need to
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
do is delete them and then you can say
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the other committee could you please
 
01:58:30.609 --> 01:58:30.619 align:start position:0%
have a look at these we don't need to
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
negotiate and bring it back to us
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay we
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
I learned that if you don't need to make
 
01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
a decision right away you don't make the
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
decision right away
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if why it would hurt
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
even though we're all predisposed to
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
killing these to get the times first but
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
you refer to division one that's what
 
01:58:53.689 --> 01:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
they did they didn't say
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
go away and then give us back they said
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
here can you handle this and then the
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee said yes and they deleted them
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
from hb1 I literally don't know what
 
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
division one did that's why I was asking
 
01:59:10.070 --> 01:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple how they handled it yeah
 
01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
and I and I don't know I haven't been
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
following what division one did with
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
this I believe in speaking with the
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
chair of Edna
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
um the licensure reform sections that
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
were in hb2 are going
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
to go into her committee for discussion
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
because they're it there's lots of
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
things that that rats nest goes pretty
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
deep so her committee is doing the Deep
 
01:59:34.729 --> 01:59:34.739 align:start position:0%
dive on that I don't know if they're
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
going to continue forward in hb2 I do
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
know speaking with the same chairman
 
01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:41.689 align:start position:0%
know speaking with the same chairman
chairwoman

01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
chairwoman
 
01:59:44.209 --> 01:59:44.219 align:start position:0%
um they have bills one of which we've
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
already passed on the house and another
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
which is coming forward to address all
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:51.020 align:start position:0%
and it's been stripped out of HP one two
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the key thing that the
 
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
the analogy here is they just division
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
one deleted it from hb2 and gave it to
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
Edna for their purposes in in
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
furtherance of that right you like
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
delaying decisions I'm out of the favor
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
of good decision bad decision no
 
02:00:07.739 --> 02:00:09.050 align:start position:0%
of good decision bad decision no
decision

02:00:09.050 --> 02:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
um my recommendation I'm not saying
 
02:00:11.810 --> 02:00:11.820 align:start position:0%
you're wrong but my recommendation would
 
02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
be we deleted out of hb2 the Senate can
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
always add it in there's lots of room if
 
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
they want to but if we delete it out of
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
hb2 and and ask
 
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
um HHS to take a look at this we would
 
02:00:24.290 --> 02:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
have a house position on this by the
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
time we get to a committee of conference
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we're maybe a near
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
violent agreement that 282 and 283 ought
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
to come out of hb2
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
and and we could somehow let
 
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Leone and her committee
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay which takes us to 284. 284 which is
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
a related subject so I'm not sure if you
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
want to address that the same way or not
 
02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:01.970 align:start position:0%
want to address that the same way or not
right

02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:04.209 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:01:04.209 --> 02:01:04.219 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
somebody whispered yes in my ear
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
all right so do we have any more
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the hospital Association
 
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:23.580 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm ready to recess this for
 
02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
at least 30 minutes did we just say that
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
that last section 284 was also going to
 
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
be on the Strip list I I think so yes
 
02:01:35.570 --> 02:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh thank you thank you so
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
much for your flexibility and your input
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh Mr White I I think
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess uh for a while
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
and we're going to come back and we're
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to talk about uh a sheet that Mr
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
Ripple put together for us and I'm I'm
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
not sure where that sheet is but
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to tell us what we're going
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
to do when we come back yeah I'm not
 
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
sure you have a copy of it but I have a
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
few documents for you one of which is a
 
02:02:09.290 --> 02:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
list of HHS change requests and
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
accompanying detail so I'm hoping you
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
can talk through that this afternoon and
 
02:02:15.890 --> 02:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
I've also prepared
 
02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
tracking sheets of the committee's
 
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
actions on House Bill one and House Bill
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
2. there are no actions yet but there
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
will be so each day I hope to update
 
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
this with what you have done so I'll be
 
02:02:29.209 --> 02:02:29.219 align:start position:0%
providing this daily
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
and so I'll give you copies for those to
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
look at when you come back to
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm I'm gonna do 30 minutes does
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.209 --> 02:02:44.219 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to recess division three
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
until uh 12 45.
 
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:01.490 --> 02:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
we are out of recess at 12 45.
 
02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
we are out of recess at 12 45.
um

02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:10.130 --> 02:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
while we were away I I got word from
 
02:49:14.330 --> 02:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office that uh we need to
 
02:49:17.389 --> 02:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so all of the hard preparation all
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
the coordination and of inviting
 
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
external parties
 
02:49:29.050 --> 02:49:29.060 align:start position:0%
we need to reschedule because of the
 
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
pending snowmageddon
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
so so that's uh that's one thing
 
02:49:38.809 --> 02:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
how will that affect
 
02:49:41.090 --> 02:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
our full uh executive session we're
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
having on Wednesday well that's a
 
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
excellent segue thanks and that's this
 
02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
piece of paper right here
 
02:49:52.010 --> 02:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
so what we were going to do tomorrow at
 
02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
one o'clock is we were going to have
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
technically all we do are work sessions
 
02:50:00.410 --> 02:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
we don't really ever have an exact
 
02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.370 align:start position:0%
we don't really ever have an exact
session

02:50:01.370 --> 02:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I'm gonna say this
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
so that Mr Ripple can correct me if I'm
 
02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:07.790 align:start position:0%
so that Mr Ripple can correct me if I'm
wrong

02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
is the only Bill that we have to decide
 
02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
on is HB 527 because it was an early
 
02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
Bill and we've got to get rid of it we
 
02:50:20.929 --> 02:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
have four other bills where we were the
 
02:50:24.610 --> 02:50:24.620 align:start position:0%
second committee so we have more time
 
02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
but because
 
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
we do work sessions
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
I don't even know that our
 
02:50:37.490 --> 02:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation and sending it
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the full finance committee needs to
 
02:50:42.650 --> 02:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
be in the calendar
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so I'm asking Mr let me ask it this
 
02:50:49.250 --> 02:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
way in a declarative statement
 
02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
I think if the minority
 
02:50:59.929 --> 02:50:59.939 align:start position:0%
if representative norgren agrees I think
 
02:51:06.050 --> 02:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
we could just vote on HB 527 now to give
 
02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
our recommendation to the full finance
 
02:51:11.150 --> 02:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
committee and not worry about coming in
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
early Wednesday because that's the
 
02:51:16.570 --> 02:51:16.580 align:start position:0%
alternative well we have a quorum
 
02:51:19.790 --> 02:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
I think we do have a quorum but I want
 
02:51:23.690 --> 02:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
to hear am I allowed to have a work
 
02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
session vote on 5 27. I'll put it this
 
02:51:29.330 --> 02:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
way division two has done exactly that
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
they've taken up bills that were noticed
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
purely as a budget work session now
 
02:51:35.690 --> 02:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative hole said that he was
 
02:51:38.170 --> 02:51:38.180 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit late
 
02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative erf is in the other room
 
02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
um so would you would you go get
 
02:51:45.410 --> 02:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Earth since he's he's
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
available and tell him we're about to
 
02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:52.250 align:start position:0%
available and tell him we're about to
vote

02:51:52.250 --> 02:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
yeah we were just so Janet usually gives
 
02:51:56.570 --> 02:51:56.580 align:start position:0%

02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
tally could you could you see if you
 
02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
could grab one thanks
 
02:52:03.469 --> 02:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
no I didn't actually wait though
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative norgren are you okay if
 
02:52:22.610 --> 02:52:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:37.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:52:37.849 --> 02:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative Mooney was
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
looking for you we're getting ready to
 
02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
oh did she find you or did you find her
 
02:52:57.650 --> 02:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.660 --> 02:52:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:52:59.210 --> 02:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:53:01.610 --> 02:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
oh and then also representative Weiler
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry he he has asked me that
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
anytime we vote that I invite him yeah
 
02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't think it'll matter uh
 
02:53:14.929 --> 02:53:14.939 align:start position:0%
we're at 5 27. uh Medicaid reimbursement
 
02:53:16.490 --> 02:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
rates for certain assisted living
 
02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:23.389 align:start position:0%
rates for certain assisted living
facilities

02:53:23.389 --> 02:53:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't think his vote will matter but
 
02:53:34.990 --> 02:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the clerk's addendum
 
02:53:40.070 --> 02:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:42.530 --> 02:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
um there is a scheduled division work
 
02:53:43.969 --> 02:53:43.979 align:start position:0%
session does that did you were you
 
02:53:46.130 --> 02:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
already aware of that for this very bill
 
02:53:48.530 --> 02:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow we had a 10 o'clock work
 
02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
session and then at one o'clock we had
 
02:53:52.670 --> 02:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
five bills the house clerk sent an
 
02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
addendum for Wednesday and has us having
 
02:54:00.010 --> 02:54:00.020 align:start position:0%
a 527 work session at 9 45 a.m
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
yes because I just agree that's what
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
you're talking about we would have had
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
to do it earlier on Wednesday right okay
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
sorry just making sure you saw this so
 
02:54:10.210 --> 02:54:10.220 align:start position:0%
if we do this now
 
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
that obviates the 945 I mean I'll still
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
come in because it's been calendared now
 
02:54:20.210 --> 02:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
and open and close it but
 
02:54:22.610 --> 02:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
um but I I think we could just give you
 
02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
guys some extra time to come in
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:50.210 --> 02:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
I I guess now okay I think this is like
 
02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
a murder mystery one one person leaves
 
02:54:57.290 --> 02:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
never to be seen again
 
02:55:00.170 --> 02:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
but we can't we can't go on without him
 
02:55:01.610 --> 02:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:55:05.210 --> 02:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
I think he's getting his sheet
 
02:55:09.530 --> 02:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
so so uh Mr chair what what we're doing
 
02:55:13.809 --> 02:55:13.819 align:start position:0%
is we're just advancing our vote on 527.
 
02:55:16.969 --> 02:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
uh I I think we've discussed it a few
 
02:55:22.730 --> 02:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:25.790 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
um division three work session on HB 527
 
02:55:34.969 --> 02:55:34.979 align:start position:0%
I would entertain a motion to itl anyone
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
I would also entertain a motion to
 
02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:46.010 align:start position:0%
I would also entertain a motion to
retain

02:55:46.010 --> 02:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would make a motion to retain
 
02:55:51.010 --> 02:55:51.020 align:start position:0%
is there a second second second
 
02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is made and seconded
 
02:55:58.730 --> 02:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
to retain house bill 527.
 
02:56:07.010 --> 02:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
discussion about Medicaid rates
 
02:56:11.570 --> 02:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
for all these providers and it seems
 
02:56:13.849 --> 02:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
like everybody should get it would make
 
02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
it at least for me it would make it much
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
clearer if I would be able to talk about
 
02:56:20.110 --> 02:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
all of them at the same time
 
02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
is there any other conversation the
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
motion right the Russian for retain
 
02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense because if we have
 
02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
any cleanup to do after we get through
 
02:56:32.510 --> 02:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
all of the Medicaid rate changes via the
 
02:56:34.190 --> 02:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
budget we have a bill in Play to work
 
02:56:36.530 --> 02:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
with and we can
 
02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
use it that way
 
02:56:40.849 --> 02:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
any further conversation go ahead
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
represent Mooney
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:56:46.190 --> 02:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
orders the bill is certainly well
 
02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
intentioned we heard some from some we
 
02:56:52.130 --> 02:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
heard from some great speakers who of
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
care very deeply about this subject
 
02:56:56.030 --> 02:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
matter and have run their own homes have
 
02:56:58.730 --> 02:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
or are currently running their own homes
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
however it is very clear that the
 
02:57:03.469 --> 02:57:03.479 align:start position:0%
original language of this bill is
 
02:57:05.690 --> 02:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
incorrect on many levels for example
 
02:57:07.610 --> 02:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
there's no real definition for a quote
 
02:57:10.450 --> 02:57:10.460 align:start position:0%
unquote small assisted living facilities
 
02:57:14.030 --> 02:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
now the sponsors of the bill did put
 
02:57:16.429 --> 02:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
forth an amendment in good faith it was
 
02:57:19.790 --> 02:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
a certainly a well amended change to the
 
02:57:21.769 --> 02:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
original language but there were still
 
02:57:23.929 --> 02:57:23.939 align:start position:0%
some holes there for example they
 
02:57:27.410 --> 02:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
referenced only 804 licenses turns out
 
02:57:30.349 --> 02:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
it could also apply to 805. so very
 
02:57:33.050 --> 02:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
clear that the bill needs work both in
 
02:57:36.010 --> 02:57:36.020 align:start position:0%
its original and proposed amended form
 
02:57:38.210 --> 02:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
also came to our attention that there's
 
02:57:41.690 --> 02:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
a Senate Bill 86 that is going to be
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
examining exactly the subject matter
 
02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
plus we have a budget so for that reason
 
02:57:50.210 --> 02:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting retain thank you I I
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that summary I'm sure the
 
02:57:54.769 --> 02:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill will as well
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
um now this was an early Bill does that
 
02:57:58.969 --> 02:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
somebody remind me does that mean it
 
02:58:02.750 --> 02:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
bypassed uh HHS in the house and came
 
02:58:04.849 --> 02:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
straight to us I believe it did
 
02:58:07.490 --> 02:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay so so there's a policy issue in
 
02:58:09.769 --> 02:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
here that the policy committee hasn't uh
 
02:58:13.010 --> 02:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
heard so representative hole on a
 
02:58:14.630 --> 02:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
tangent I just saw an email from the
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
clerk I don't know whether you guys
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
discussed it all business tomorrow has
 
02:58:19.370 --> 02:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
been canceled and stuff moved to
 
02:58:22.070 --> 02:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we we discussed that while you
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
were away and and also we did some
 
02:58:28.370 --> 02:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
birthday party planning and but yeah yes
 
02:58:31.450 --> 02:58:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
all right so uh representative Weiler
 
02:58:38.929 --> 02:58:38.939 align:start position:0%
the public needs to understand
 
02:58:42.650 --> 02:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
that the Medicaid rates for a nursing
 
02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:43.429 align:start position:0%
that the Medicaid rates for a nursing
home

02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
are not affordable by any nursing home
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
the only way it works like in the county
 
02:58:50.750 --> 02:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
home is the property taxpayers are
 
02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
making up the difference and and I was
 
02:58:55.570 --> 02:58:55.580 align:start position:0%
also involved with the Masonic Home
 
02:58:59.210 --> 02:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
where we were up we could afford up to
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
20 percent uh Medicaid but that was only
 
02:59:06.050 --> 02:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
because all the Masons were expected to
 
02:59:08.450 --> 02:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
send in checks to that home every year
 
02:59:11.630 --> 02:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
so people need to understand if if they
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
need to go to a nursing home they're
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
lucky to find a spot if all they've got
 
02:59:20.410 --> 02:59:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
02:59:26.570 --> 02:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
not seeing any discussion
 
02:59:28.849 --> 02:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
um Mr clerk would you call the role
 
02:59:31.870 --> 02:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
plays uh yes on House Bill
 
02:59:35.690 --> 02:59:35.700 align:start position:0%

02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:37.969 align:start position:0%
527 the motion is to retain
um

02:59:37.969 --> 02:59:37.979 align:start position:0%

03:00:02.230 --> 03:00:02.240 align:start position:0%

representative Weiler yes chairman one
 
03:00:12.650 --> 03:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.969 --> 03:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
okay the vote is nine nine to zero I do
 
03:00:18.290 --> 03:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
03:00:21.290 --> 03:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
um uh is
 
03:00:21.300 --> 03:00:22.730 align:start position:0%
um uh is
um

03:00:22.730 --> 03:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:26.330 --> 03:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
does this now go stay in and finance
 
03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:27.170 align:start position:0%
does this now go stay in and finance
three

03:00:27.170 --> 03:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:00:29.929 --> 03:00:29.939 align:start position:0%
as a retained Bill and then and it does
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
not need to be confirmed by the full
 
03:00:33.530 --> 03:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
finance committee that it's retained so
 
03:00:35.929 --> 03:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
there's no committee report it just goes
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
on a list of retained bills okay thank
 
03:00:39.889 --> 03:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
you but doesn't
 
03:00:42.250 --> 03:00:42.260 align:start position:0%
the full committee need to
 
03:00:43.969 --> 03:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
confirm it
 
03:00:45.769 --> 03:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't who the full committee the full
 
03:00:48.610 --> 03:00:48.620 align:start position:0%
finance committee yes
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
so there will be a full finance
 
03:00:52.730 --> 03:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
committee vote on whether or not to
 
03:00:54.410 --> 03:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
accept our recommendation to retain
 
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:02.450 --> 03:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on on that
 
03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
there there are other there are still
 
03:01:06.290 --> 03:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
four bills that we have that were second
 
03:01:10.670 --> 03:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
committee bills so we have more time
 
03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:11.269 align:start position:0%
committee bills so we have more time
um

03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:13.370 --> 03:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do those today I don't
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
think we should but we do need to
 
03:01:17.809 --> 03:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
reschedule them do you have any thoughts
 
03:01:19.849 --> 03:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
on rescheduling those
 
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
particularly given that we just lost
 
03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:23.210 align:start position:0%
particularly given that we just lost
tomorrow

03:01:23.210 --> 03:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:01:25.070 --> 03:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
what 29 is scheduled for Wednesday
 
03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:27.290 align:start position:0%
what 29 is scheduled for Wednesday
morning

03:01:27.290 --> 03:01:27.300 align:start position:0%

I would uh
 
03:01:40.010 --> 03:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.929 --> 03:01:41.939 align:start position:0%
possibly late next week I think the
 
03:01:43.190 --> 03:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee should really address all of
 
03:01:44.990 --> 03:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
its budget work before it gets back to
 
03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
I I do think that's the right priority
 
03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
I I do think that's the right priority
foreign

03:01:57.160 --> 03:01:57.170 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:57.170 --> 03:01:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
agreement I'll stop asking then
 
03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:03.110 align:start position:0%
agreement I'll stop asking then

03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:04.730 --> 03:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:02:04.740 --> 03:02:06.170 align:start position:0%
all right

03:02:06.170 --> 03:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:06.180 --> 03:02:08.210 align:start position:0%
um
then

03:02:08.210 --> 03:02:08.220 align:start position:0%

03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:42.410 --> 03:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:44.450 --> 03:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
so you have a summary sheet containing
 
03:02:46.370 --> 03:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
all of the Department's requests of
 
03:02:47.809 --> 03:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
division three
 
03:02:50.450 --> 03:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
and I've taken the liberty of breaking
 
03:02:52.429 --> 03:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
these out uh a bit differently than the
 
03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
department may have on the first page
 
03:02:56.450 --> 03:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
you have technical requests
 
03:02:58.670 --> 03:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I consider these technical because
 
03:03:01.070 --> 03:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
they do not add General funds they do
 
03:03:04.010 --> 03:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
not add permanent full-time positions
 
03:03:05.809 --> 03:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
they're things like acceptance of
 
03:03:07.550 --> 03:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
Federal grant money that wasn't budgeted
 
03:03:09.769 --> 03:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
their movement of funds between Class
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
Lines within an accounting unit so to my
 
03:03:14.030 --> 03:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
mind at least these are all purely
 
03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
Technical and if anyone sees anything
 
03:03:18.290 --> 03:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
here that they they disagree with that
 
03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
assessment by all means feel free to
 
03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
take it off but my Hope was that the
 
03:03:24.170 --> 03:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
division could vote on these as a block
 
03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
everything that's on the first page of
 
03:03:28.370 --> 03:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
this summary sheet
 
03:03:31.870 --> 03:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.030 --> 03:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
let's do this one page at a time so so
 
03:03:37.130 --> 03:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
people should be looking at the front
 
03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
page the technical request total I I do
 
03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
because I my eyes aren't that good to
 
03:03:46.429 --> 03:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
read the description right off the way
 
03:03:49.250 --> 03:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
so this is a tobacco one what are we
 
03:03:53.090 --> 03:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:56.090 --> 03:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
line item two
 
03:03:58.250 --> 03:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
this is a carry forward of federal funds
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
and Nathan would be in a better position
 
03:04:02.690 --> 03:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
than I am to discuss the details I'm
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.050 --> 03:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative norgren do you think you
 
03:04:17.210 --> 03:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
all will be comfortable just having us
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
take a Voice vote on whether or not we
 
03:04:22.730 --> 03:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
want to accept these technical request
 
03:04:22.740 --> 03:04:27.230 align:start position:0%
want to accept these technical request
changes

03:04:27.230 --> 03:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:31.250 --> 03:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
if you want to just end intake now and
 
03:04:33.170 --> 03:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
caucus and we'll vote later that's okay
 
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
I just I I'd like to be able to move on
 
03:04:38.809 --> 03:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
things we can move on is this thousands
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
and thousands
 
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
those are actual dollars so the general
 
03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
fund decreases literally twenty five
 
03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
thousand eight hundred eighty two okay
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's not talking about a lot of money
 
03:04:46.560 --> 03:05:23.090 align:start position:0%
it's not talking about a lot of money
here

03:05:23.090 --> 03:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.450 --> 03:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
so the second page has prioritized needs
 
03:05:29.750 --> 03:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
and others so I'd like to see if we're
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay on the front page under technical
 
03:05:34.730 --> 03:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
requests and just accepting these
 
03:05:37.250 --> 03:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
um I was going to take line 14 which was
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
an obvious one if the department right
 
03:05:43.849 --> 03:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
is not moving forward with a contractor
 
03:05:45.769 --> 03:05:45.779 align:start position:0%
initiative to the tune of almost three
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:48.410 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
um

03:05:48.410 --> 03:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:50.090 --> 03:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's an easy one that I think we could
 
03:05:55.790 --> 03:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:57.830 --> 03:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
so you accepted as written on the
 
03:05:57.840 --> 03:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
so you accepted as written on the
document

03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:05:59.520 --> 03:06:00.889 align:start position:0%
document
yes

03:06:00.889 --> 03:06:00.899 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:06:03.050 --> 03:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay what I think we're trying to do is
 
03:06:05.389 --> 03:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
to see if we can accept the entire front
 
03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
page all line items all one vote
 
03:06:12.110 --> 03:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
accept all of the front page
 
03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
as it is written
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
all right let's uh let's do this on a
 
03:06:23.809 --> 03:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
show of hands on page one uh all 15 line
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
items on the technical request sheet
 
03:06:28.969 --> 03:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
raise your hands if you're in favor of
 
03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
passing it along
 
03:06:34.250 --> 03:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
any opposed representative poll you
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:39.530 --> 03:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
since I don't understand all of them
 
03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
I'll oppose but I'm okay with it passing
 
03:06:45.050 --> 03:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
so so eight eight to one I think we can
 
03:06:47.690 --> 03:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
we can go to the second page now now
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
what would you like to do with this Mr
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
Ripple the prioritize needs how do you
 
03:06:54.769 --> 03:06:54.779 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it well I think it
 
03:06:56.090 --> 03:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
might be best for the committee to have
 
03:06:57.889 --> 03:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
Nathan address the prioritize needs
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
items as you can see here the dollars
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
are a lot greater
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and these are prioritized needs that
 
03:07:05.210 --> 03:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
were not included in the governor's
 
03:07:07.309 --> 03:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
budget and I believe these are
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
the ones that were discussed
 
03:07:11.570 --> 03:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
throughout the meetings that the
 
03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
committee has had you've asked questions
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
about certain certain areas and whether
 
03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
the department had prioritized needs in
 
03:07:18.889 --> 03:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
those areas and
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:25.010 --> 03:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
so so what I what I would propose doing
 
03:07:28.010 --> 03:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren is
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
um if if there's any further questions
 
03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
on the prioritized need maybe we could
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
ask them now uh otherwise not do
 
03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
anything more than ask questions and
 
03:07:41.389 --> 03:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
then you we can each caucus and come
 
03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
back in our next meeting to to talk
 
03:07:46.070 --> 03:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
about what we want to do with each of
 
03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
these that's my proposal what do you
 
03:07:48.779 --> 03:07:52.250 align:start position:0%
these that's my proposal what do you
think

03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:59.090 --> 03:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question on
 
03:08:05.570 --> 03:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:05.580 --> 03:08:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
to

03:08:08.450 --> 03:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:08.460 --> 03:08:10.130 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:10.140 --> 03:08:11.630 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:08:23.330 --> 03:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.370 --> 03:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
Nathan white Chief finance officer
 
03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um representing representative norgren
 
03:08:32.570 --> 03:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
just to clarify uh the second page line
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
03:08:43.849 --> 03:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
um sure so in the current biennium
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
um we have been under budgeted
 
03:08:49.090 --> 03:08:49.100 align:start position:0%
in this in this particular line
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
we had submitted a prioritized needs
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
request during the governor's phase that
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
was not funded to to uh to cover these
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
costs we've had to transfer funds from
 
03:09:02.510 --> 03:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
from elsewhere within within the
 
03:09:06.530 --> 03:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
department to to cover these costs and
 
03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
um these are these are essentially
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
dollars that we pay to the federal
 
03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
government to support the Medicare Part
 
03:09:16.370 --> 03:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
D insurance premium payments for dual
 
03:09:18.050 --> 03:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
eligible individuals so individuals that
 
03:09:21.950 --> 03:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
are eligible for Medicaid and Medicare
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
um this I'll I'll pause there
 
03:09:28.550 --> 03:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:09:32.030 --> 03:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
yep you're good are the as I'm looking
 
03:09:33.410 --> 03:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
at these
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
um there's others here that feel like
 
03:09:38.210 --> 03:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at them for the first time
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
but uh but that's just the way my memory
 
03:09:42.769 --> 03:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
works you have a question representative
 
03:09:45.110 --> 03:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
I do
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
um line 21 system of care that's a big
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
chunk of
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
um money
 
03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
can you explain what the children's
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
residential treatment rate is and just
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
where that is in the grander scheme of
 
03:09:59.809 --> 03:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
things sure so
 
03:09:59.819 --> 03:10:00.530 align:start position:0%
things sure so
um

03:10:00.530 --> 03:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:03.530 --> 03:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
when when dcyf division for children
 
03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
youth and families came in and then I
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
believe Katia Fox as well during for the
 
03:10:10.010 --> 03:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
division of Behavioral Health
 
03:10:11.690 --> 03:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
um had had referenced this this
 
03:10:13.790 --> 03:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
prioritize need
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
last year we entered into contracts with
 
03:10:19.490 --> 03:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
the residential rate providers
 
03:10:21.650 --> 03:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
previously we had paid them through
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
through other mechanisms but during that
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
process we established rates
 
03:10:29.830 --> 03:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
um with with all these providers it has
 
03:10:32.450 --> 03:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
since been determined that those rates
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
are not sufficient to cover their actual
 
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
costs incurred so we went and look at
 
03:10:40.010 --> 03:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
their we looked at everyone's costs as
 
03:10:42.889 --> 03:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
far as what they reported and determined
 
03:10:46.130 --> 03:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
additional funds are needed to for those
 
03:10:48.290 --> 03:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
contracts okay I think I've missed that
 
03:10:53.210 --> 03:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
representing walner
 
03:10:58.429 --> 03:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
so remind me on that same line what it
 
03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:06.170 --> 03:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
or that in in the system of Caroline yes
 
03:11:08.570 --> 03:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
um though there's a mix of funding there
 
03:11:11.090 --> 03:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
and and so part of the part of the cost
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
is dependent upon the individual child
 
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
um so Medicaid would would play a a
 
03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
major role within that line
 
03:11:22.190 --> 03:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be
 
03:11:24.290 --> 03:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh we've been talking about Medicaid
 
03:11:24.300 --> 03:11:25.370 align:start position:0%
uh we've been talking about Medicaid
rates

03:11:25.370 --> 03:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:11:27.410 --> 03:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
this morning and we're actually going to
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
have a Time
 
03:11:30.769 --> 03:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
coming up here that we're going to talk
 
03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid rates
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't this be
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
better to have it discussed with that
 
03:11:43.370 --> 03:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
that group of other Medicaid rate
 
03:11:46.490 --> 03:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
increases that we're we may look at
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
I believe I misspoke that now I'm
 
03:11:49.610 --> 03:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
thinking about how that particular
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
contract Works um
 
03:11:53.210 --> 03:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
let me follow up with you because
 
03:11:54.889 --> 03:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
there's three separate funding sources
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
within that contract and the Medicaid
 
03:11:56.640 --> 03:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
within that contract and the Medicaid
dollars

03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:11:59.630 --> 03:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
let me verify that those would actually
 
03:12:01.250 --> 03:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
show up here I don't believe they would
 
03:12:03.050 --> 03:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
now that I'm thinking about it I believe
 
03:12:04.730 --> 03:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
they're a budget out of another account
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
but let me get that detail for you okay
 
03:12:08.990 --> 03:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
so you're going to tell us what the if
 
03:12:11.450 --> 03:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's not Medicaid I I really like to
 
03:12:13.250 --> 03:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
know what these federal funds are of
 
03:12:13.260 --> 03:12:16.250 align:start position:0%
know what these federal funds are of
course

03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:18.769 --> 03:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
all right and so the key word that
 
03:12:20.750 --> 03:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
flagged all of that is under description
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about rates
 
03:12:24.710 --> 03:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
treatment rates
 
03:12:27.650 --> 03:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
so my simple way all of those rate
 
03:12:40.490 --> 03:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:12:45.469 --> 03:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
Nathan yes is that section right
 
03:12:52.610 --> 03:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
underline sections 2122 the same section
 
03:12:56.269 --> 03:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
that also covered some of the child care
 
03:12:59.450 --> 03:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
costs that's all that large increase was
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
that is that in the same
 
03:13:04.490 --> 03:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
division so I remember and I don't have
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
the page in front of me where we were
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
going from ninety five hundred dollars
 
03:13:13.610 --> 03:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
for child care for 3 100 families or
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
something up to 11
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
000 in child care expenses is that the
 
03:13:19.130 --> 03:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
same section or is that different no no
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
this is entirely different okay thank
 
03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:24.730 align:start position:0%
this is entirely different okay thank
you

03:13:24.730 --> 03:13:24.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:29.450 --> 03:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Waller thank you so on
 
03:13:32.210 --> 03:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
pay on line 20.
 
03:13:33.180 --> 03:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:13:33.190 --> 03:13:33.650 align:start position:0%
that is
[Music]

03:13:33.650 --> 03:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:13:33.660 --> 03:13:34.790 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
when I read the description I thought it
 
03:13:38.330 --> 03:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
was interesting it's about uh
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
stabilization services
 
03:13:44.570 --> 03:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
and in locations around the state
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I was just reading about other
 
03:13:46.560 --> 03:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
and I was just reading about other
states

03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:13:51.190 --> 03:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
who actually have crisis
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
stabilization centers I mean I read
 
03:13:55.849 --> 03:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
something about Tennessee I read
 
03:13:57.370 --> 03:13:57.380 align:start position:0%
something about Massachusetts
 
03:14:01.750 --> 03:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
where instead of using emergency rooms
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
people are actually using
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
these Sinners or mental health centers
 
03:14:11.210 --> 03:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
is this in is this what we're talking
 
03:14:13.010 --> 03:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
about is it similar
 
03:14:14.929 --> 03:14:14.939 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about here
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
I I my understanding is yes
 
03:14:20.570 --> 03:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
um but but I can have Katya fox come
 
03:14:21.950 --> 03:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
down and speak a little bit more
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
specifically to this
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
um because because this is this is part
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:31.370 --> 03:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
if if you'd like her to come down to
 
03:14:34.370 --> 03:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.550 --> 03:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:14:38.809 --> 03:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
talk to me
 
03:14:41.809 --> 03:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be here yeah I you know
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at these and and my memory
 
03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
is just gone because I I the Hampstead
 
03:14:46.500 --> 03:14:47.450 align:start position:0%
is just gone because I I the Hampstead
Hospital

03:14:47.450 --> 03:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
03:14:49.389 --> 03:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
I don't remember this extra
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
8.8 million to cover
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
quote projected expenses I I just don't
 
03:14:57.290 --> 03:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
does anyone else remember going through
 
03:15:03.469 --> 03:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital and and seeing an 8
 
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
million 8.8 oh I'm sorry which one I'm
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the bottom one 23.
 
03:15:14.510 --> 03:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it's uh 8.8 in the two years General
 
03:15:23.150 --> 03:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.030 --> 03:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
that that feels like the very first time
 
03:15:27.190 --> 03:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
for me
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
Mr White I actually I actually think
 
03:15:31.790 --> 03:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's an error here the the the 24
 
03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
should be zero
 
03:15:39.170 --> 03:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
um the the 25 figure so we had spoken a
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
couple of times about some of the
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
challenges that we have there because we
 
03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of history behind the
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
expenses and the revenues and during the
 
03:15:50.929 --> 03:15:50.939 align:start position:0%
governor's phase of the budget
 
03:15:53.570 --> 03:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
um this the state fiscal year 2025 the
 
03:15:56.210 --> 03:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
general funds were cut in half
 
03:15:57.769 --> 03:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
um and what you're seeing there is our
 
03:15:59.690 --> 03:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
request to add those back in just to
 
03:15:59.700 --> 03:16:00.710 align:start position:0%
request to add those back in just to
clarify

03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
okay so 24 it says 4.4 million but you
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
think that should be zero correct
 
03:16:12.710 --> 03:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
and in 25 this 20 the this 4.4 million
 
03:16:14.750 --> 03:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
is kind of like an insurance policy
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the business
 
03:16:18.650 --> 03:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
history and we we want to make sure that
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
we don't end up in a lost situation I
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't think I'd call an insurance policy
 
03:16:25.429 --> 03:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
based on the trends that we're seeing
 
03:16:28.250 --> 03:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
right now those those funds are required
 
03:16:30.769 --> 03:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
um and uh once I get out of here I'll be
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
providing the committee with an
 
03:16:34.730 --> 03:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
additional analysis this is just to show
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
you the expense and revenue that we've
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
had year to date what do you think 4.4
 
03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
million is as a percentage of all
 
03:16:41.160 --> 03:16:42.469 align:start position:0%
million is as a percentage of all
expenses

03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
03:16:48.050 --> 03:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:56.330 --> 03:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
for reference in 24 it's currently a
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
budget this is an HP one it's currently
 
03:17:05.870 --> 03:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
budgeted at 9.2 million in 24 and 4.7
 
03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
and 25 so I think what this is doing and
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
bringing the 25 figure up
 
03:17:13.849 --> 03:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
to the same level as the 24 figure 23 24
 
03:17:13.859 --> 03:17:16.849 align:start position:0%
to the same level as the 24 figure 23 24
figure

03:17:16.849 --> 03:17:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's what yes that is correct and then
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
and then okay
 
03:17:29.090 --> 03:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.570 --> 03:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
okay so are there any line items here
 
03:17:35.450 --> 03:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
that anyone wants to have
 
03:17:39.710 --> 03:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
somebody come back and talk to us about
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't mind hearing more about the
 
03:17:43.730 --> 03:17:43.740 align:start position:0%
system of care one in particular
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
system of care 2023 or 21 22 yeah
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I think all these should be
 
03:17:52.550 --> 03:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
discussed in the context of what we want
 
03:17:54.110 --> 03:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
to do with all kinds of things not just
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to what they want to do so
 
03:18:00.410 --> 03:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
so let's how does this does this feel
 
03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
like it'd work let's let's kind of table
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
these items
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
let's get through the core of our hb1
 
03:18:08.160 --> 03:18:10.610 align:start position:0%
let's get through the core of our hb1
work

03:18:10.610 --> 03:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
um these are not in none of these are in
 
03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
hp2s these are all potential hb1
 
03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
editions right
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
so so let's see if we can get through
 
03:18:21.190 --> 03:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
our core
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
and um and then while we're getting
 
03:18:26.450 --> 03:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
through our core if if if these come up
 
03:18:28.550 --> 03:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
in that course of discussion we can have
 
03:18:30.170 --> 03:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
that sidebar
 
03:18:32.690 --> 03:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
and if
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
and otherwise we could we could hold
 
03:18:37.010 --> 03:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
these to the end does that make sense
 
03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
you're looking at me like that doesn't
 
03:18:42.170 --> 03:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
make sense Representative no
 
03:18:44.210 --> 03:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm still working out the process and
 
03:18:46.610 --> 03:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
how this all plays out so it's fine
 
03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
could I ask a question well that that
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense to you let's sort of
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
postpone these all right could I ask a
 
03:18:57.769 --> 03:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
question yesterday line 27 before we do
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
this yeah uh we're not on 27 yet okay
 
03:19:04.910 --> 03:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm still on the piano okay fine fine
 
03:19:07.730 --> 03:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
okay so does that make sense to you Mr
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
Ripple because you're really the one
 
03:19:11.150 --> 03:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's managing and juggling all this
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes it does make sense and
 
03:19:15.050 --> 03:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
I did not expect you to take any votes
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
on the prioritized needs today that's
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
one reason I separated everything out
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
this way yeah okay well I was genius on
 
03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
your part then so
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
um do you want to lead us in a
 
03:19:30.530 --> 03:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
conversation then what an other is Right
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
other is sort of a catch-all category
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I created here and the items in the
 
03:19:38.210 --> 03:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
other category either add General funds
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
or they convert temporary positions to
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
full-time positions
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
or their accounting units that are of
 
03:19:45.650 --> 03:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
particular interest to individual
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
division members mainly I included the
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
other category by taking out items from
 
03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
the technical category that I thought
 
03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
might hold up your ability to vote on it
 
03:19:59.469 --> 03:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay so I think fam is there a question
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
you gave me a hand movement okay
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
see you got me trained out of the corner
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
of my eye I see you okay so I think line
 
03:20:17.809 --> 03:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
item 25 is the Family Planning money uh
 
03:20:20.690 --> 03:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
I think this was uh probably put in
 
03:20:22.250 --> 03:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
there because I've shown interest in
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
this line before
 
03:20:28.610 --> 03:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah I actually sent Mr Ripple
 
03:20:31.010 --> 03:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
a whole different set of numbers for
 
03:20:33.650 --> 03:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
this one Have you shared that yet with
 
03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh Mr White
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
no I haven't okay so yeah there's
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
definitely some work to be done on that
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
one for sure a lot more than what's here
 
03:20:47.630 --> 03:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay so so I just want to um say the
 
03:20:50.090 --> 03:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
part that I remember and and see if it's
 
03:20:53.870 --> 03:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
included in this number or not we in in
 
03:20:58.130 --> 03:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
the previous budget we uh allotted fifty
 
03:21:00.530 --> 03:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars which basically worked
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
out to up to five grants of ten thousand
 
03:21:08.330 --> 03:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
each for new vendors as an incentive to
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
to bid on the family planning
 
03:21:15.410 --> 03:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
this time when we talked about it I ask
 
03:21:18.110 --> 03:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
that we double that because not a single
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
person or not an entity rather had had
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
bid on Family Planning so so I wanted to
 
03:21:27.530 --> 03:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
up the bonus pool to a hundred thousand
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
and a potential of 20 000 per
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
um successful contract awardee who's new
 
03:21:38.929 --> 03:21:38.939 align:start position:0%
that that's what I remember is is a
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand that I mentioned in
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
that meeting is that part of the 984 and
 
03:21:46.190 --> 03:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm not assuming that anyone else
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
agrees with it I'm just trying to make
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
sure I understand that number
 
03:21:54.290 --> 03:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
do you know well my answer would be I
 
03:21:55.730 --> 03:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
believe this is just correcting what
 
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
they got wrong with what's in the basic
 
03:21:59.450 --> 03:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
budget and that that in itself needs a
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
correction and then once that's all done
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
we need to discuss what you just brought
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
so that has to be deferred anyways
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:22:14.030 --> 03:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
um so represent represent an order did
 
03:22:16.269 --> 03:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
you have a representative
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
so this shows this numbers going down so
 
03:22:22.190 --> 03:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
savings to the budget right and
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's federal funds but yes
 
03:22:24.479 --> 03:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
it's federal funds but yes
um

03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.190 --> 03:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's just money we haven't been able to
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
spend or because we haven't been able to
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
contact no it's an incorrect um
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
just incorrect budgeting basically and
 
03:22:38.090 --> 03:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's still incorrect
 
03:22:40.610 --> 03:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
we'll get it right
 
03:22:44.269 --> 03:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.889 --> 03:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
so when I see
 
03:22:45.899 --> 03:22:46.730 align:start position:0%
so when I see
um

03:22:46.730 --> 03:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:52.370 --> 03:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
on line 27 the sununu center
 
03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
um allocation here that is also in house
 
03:22:55.319 --> 03:22:56.269 align:start position:0%
um allocation here that is also in house
bill

03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:22:59.030 --> 03:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. so basically we're just
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
moving the funds from house bill to over
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
to House Bill one
 
03:23:06.530 --> 03:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
but we were going to have some
 
03:23:08.990 --> 03:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
deeper information about the lines that
 
03:23:11.570 --> 03:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
would go on is that correct yes it's it
 
03:23:13.849 --> 03:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
just came through my email so I'll be 40
 
03:23:13.859 --> 03:23:14.769 align:start position:0%
just came through my email so I'll be 40
minutes

03:23:14.769 --> 03:23:14.779 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay on who I representative Weiler
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
so online
 
03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.630 align:start position:0%
so online
19.

03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
19.
 
03:23:26.640 --> 03:23:27.410 align:start position:0%
19.
um

03:23:27.410 --> 03:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:30.290 --> 03:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
dual eligible individuals
 
03:23:32.990 --> 03:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
if they're eligible twice why do we need
 
03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
more money only one one time would they
 
03:23:38.290 --> 03:23:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:42.530 --> 03:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
so I this Dells are pretty deep into the
 
03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program
 
03:23:45.950 --> 03:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think when Henry lippman comes
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
down here Whatever Whenever the next
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
rescheduled meeting is we can kind of
 
03:23:52.010 --> 03:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
delve into that but this is basically
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
the amount that we have to pay back to
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
03:23:59.210 --> 03:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
they collected twice
 
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
so so they they require that the state
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
pay them back a certain dollar figure to
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:12.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:24:12.349 --> 03:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:15.950 --> 03:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
I don't see the phrase dual eligible am
 
03:24:18.170 --> 03:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
I missing it
 
03:24:21.170 --> 03:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah third line
 
03:24:22.969 --> 03:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
there it is
 
03:24:25.729 --> 03:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
do do all eligible Medicare usually pays
 
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
80 percent Medicaid 20 typically so
 
03:24:31.790 --> 03:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare is paying first and then we pay
 
03:24:34.010 --> 03:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
back Medicare I think that's what this
 
03:24:38.090 --> 03:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
um on the pdab
 
03:24:51.830 --> 03:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's an hb2 item that goes with this
 
03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:53.630 align:start position:0%
there's an hb2 item that goes with this
um

03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:57.530 --> 03:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
it's being heard as a an amendment to a
 
03:24:59.929 --> 03:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
house bill in Commerce
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
this week I think
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and I would carry it over here it
 
03:25:07.790 --> 03:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
basically the
 
03:25:07.800 --> 03:25:08.690 align:start position:0%
basically the
the

03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:10.969 --> 03:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
pdab for those that don't remember the
 
03:25:12.530 --> 03:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
acronym the prescription drug
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
with the amendment being presented to
 
03:25:19.130 --> 03:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
Commerce does
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
this is essentially just three things
 
03:25:24.889 --> 03:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the gel car unanimous
 
03:25:27.889 --> 03:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
recommendation it has the legislature
 
03:25:31.010 --> 03:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
relooking the fee structure which seemed
 
03:25:33.170 --> 03:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
to be contrary to the New Hampshire
 
03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
Constitution that was sort of the advice
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
given to jailcar with the recommendation
 
03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
that the legislature re-look at so so
 
03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
the first thing it does is rather than
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
allowing them to have this fee structure
 
03:25:51.729 --> 03:25:51.739 align:start position:0%
that really is a tax
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
we would just fund the pdab with General
 
03:25:54.840 --> 03:25:56.030 align:start position:0%
we would just fund the pdab with General
funds

03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
also because there was a lot of
 
03:26:01.969 --> 03:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
testimony from activist groups saying
 
03:26:03.769 --> 03:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
that the pdab was something really
 
03:26:08.510 --> 03:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile we created a dedicated fund
 
03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:09.889 align:start position:0%
worthwhile we created a dedicated fund
where

03:26:09.889 --> 03:26:09.899 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:26:12.530 --> 03:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
groups could contribute
 
03:26:15.490 --> 03:26:15.500 align:start position:0%
towards the pdab mission
 
03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
the the big contenders for that were new
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
Futures and the AARP
 
03:26:24.170 --> 03:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
and then the third thing and I think the
 
03:26:25.729 --> 03:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
third thing is really the biggest thing
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
of all is it eliminates
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
the ability of the pdab to Levy fines
 
03:26:37.370 --> 03:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
the uh the finding Authority had no
 
03:26:38.830 --> 03:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
check on it
 
03:26:44.330 --> 03:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
the pdab could issue a data call of
 
03:26:44.340 --> 03:26:45.610 align:start position:0%
the pdab could issue a data call of
their

03:26:45.610 --> 03:26:45.620 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the the data call
 
03:26:53.750 --> 03:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
who didn't have to stand up to any sort
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
of principles or standards this could be
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
pretty minor I think the chairman of the
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
pdab gave us the example of whether or
 
03:27:04.370 --> 03:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
not a portion of a vial was being put
 
03:27:06.769 --> 03:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
back into stock they could ask about
 
03:27:10.010 --> 03:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
that sort of level of detail if the
 
03:27:11.570 --> 03:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
answer wasn't forthcoming they could
 
03:27:13.849 --> 03:27:13.859 align:start position:0%
start finding them a thousand dollars a
 
03:27:16.849 --> 03:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
day up to twenty five thousand so that
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
finding authorities seemed pretty
 
03:27:20.269 --> 03:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and without a check and
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
balance on it so the Commerce Amendment
 
03:27:25.790 --> 03:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
strips that
 
03:27:28.690 --> 03:27:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.590 --> 03:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's 124. we're we're going to be right
 
03:27:39.170 --> 03:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
behind you at two o'clock we want all
 
03:27:41.090 --> 03:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
the committee members over in the
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
chamber to listen to the input from the
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
yeah well it wasn't my idea I got a note
 
03:27:57.650 --> 03:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh okay so so the pdab
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
runs up also against
 
03:28:00.239 --> 03:28:01.010 align:start position:0%
runs up also against
um

03:28:01.010 --> 03:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:04.250 --> 03:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
the the governor's portion of the hb2 I
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't know which division is looking at
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
it not us uh runs up against a new
 
03:28:12.349 --> 03:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
um commission or something from the
 
03:28:12.359 --> 03:28:13.250 align:start position:0%
um commission or something from the
governor

03:28:13.250 --> 03:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
governor
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
the the executive branch to to look at
 
03:28:18.530 --> 03:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
regulatory reform looking for
 
03:28:22.570 --> 03:28:22.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities to streamline so so so
 
03:28:27.050 --> 03:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
there's a an amendment uh to hb2 being
 
03:28:30.830 --> 03:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
drafted to have the the pdab participate
 
03:28:34.190 --> 03:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
in that regulatory reform
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
effort to ensure that they don't have a
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
redundancy in there and there's several
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to eliminate
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
redundancy so this dollar amount of
 
03:28:50.050 --> 03:28:50.060 align:start position:0%
104 of other
 
03:28:52.370 --> 03:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
would not be other
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
if if we accept the hb2 item or if the
 
03:28:58.370 --> 03:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
Commerce bill passes it would not be
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
other because they won't be collecting
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
this from
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
third parties
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
it would become General funds to the
 
03:29:09.410 --> 03:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
extent that we budgeted
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the amount that we budgeted is I
 
03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
think something that we have yet to
 
03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:16.190 align:start position:0%
think something that we have yet to
discussed

03:29:16.190 --> 03:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:29:19.309 --> 03:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
discuss I'm thinking more of a seventy
 
03:29:22.429 --> 03:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar range for
 
03:29:24.889 --> 03:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
a personal Consulting contract to give
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
them ability to go get some Manpower and
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
some extra money to pay for some extra
 
03:29:32.330 --> 03:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
things but that would be a substantial
 
03:29:35.269 --> 03:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
reduction in the half a million or so
 
03:29:37.849 --> 03:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
that they're they're requesting so the
 
03:29:37.859 --> 03:29:39.050 align:start position:0%
that they're they're requesting so the
pdab

03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
pdab
 
03:29:41.210 --> 03:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
line item is going to be pretty
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.929 --> 03:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
probably that that's a that's that's a
 
03:29:49.729 --> 03:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
big discussion for us to get ready to
 
03:29:50.769 --> 03:29:50.779 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
03:29:54.170 --> 03:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's probably at least
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
an hour to schedule the pdab by itself
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
well I I'm seeing you looking away like
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
that was that's a horrible idea what do
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
you think
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
well I wouldn't schedule it individually
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
I would just take it up as part of a
 
03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
larger budget work session
 
03:30:12.120 --> 03:30:13.370 align:start position:0%
larger budget work session
I

03:30:13.370 --> 03:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
no I know I'm just saying within a work
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
session okay okay there's a block for
 
03:30:21.050 --> 03:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
about an hour so the only uh the only
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
other thing I would mention is that with
 
03:30:22.800 --> 03:30:23.870 align:start position:0%
other thing I would mention is that with
tomorrow

03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:30:26.330 --> 03:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
out of the picture uh Wednesday is out
 
03:30:27.769 --> 03:30:27.779 align:start position:0%
of the picture because you have a full
 
03:30:29.570 --> 03:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
Finance exec session on several dozen
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
bills Thursday you have a house session
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
so you have Friday which currently I
 
03:30:37.010 --> 03:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
believe the division scheduled to meet
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
at one I was going to ask you about
 
03:30:41.210 --> 03:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
moving that up to the morning I I can
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
move earlier okay so you'll have Friday
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
and Monday
 
03:30:48.349 --> 03:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
followed by potentially three full days
 
03:30:49.729 --> 03:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
of house sessions I don't know what's
 
03:30:51.250 --> 03:30:51.260 align:start position:0%
going to happen with next Tuesday so
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
when when's our drop dead date where we
 
03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
have to give something to the full
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
um well I'm supposed to tell you that
 
03:31:02.330 --> 03:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
you need to have all your decisions done
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
by Monday but you could have them done
 
03:31:07.630 --> 03:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
by Friday next Friday
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
so the real answer is Monday
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then I could go as late as Friday
 
03:31:17.929 --> 03:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
without theoretically breaking things
 
03:31:20.210 --> 03:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
yes but the three days of potential
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
house sessions
 
03:31:24.290 --> 03:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
complicates all of that so it really
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
I think Monday is probably unrealistic I
 
03:31:32.330 --> 03:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
would aim for Monday but I think you'll
 
03:31:34.610 --> 03:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
probably end up having to use Friday
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
with Tuesday Wednesday Thursday possibly
 
03:31:39.410 --> 03:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
out of the mix due to house sessions
 
03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:40.790 align:start position:0%
out of the mix due to house sessions
correct

03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
so we're almost done
 
03:31:50.210 --> 03:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
what is that
 
03:31:50.220 --> 03:31:51.349 align:start position:0%
what is that
um

03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:53.929 --> 03:31:53.939 align:start position:0%
so let's let's finish let's just make
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure we can come off of this sheet first
 
03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
are there any other items there to be
 
03:31:57.720 --> 03:32:08.809 align:start position:0%
are there any other items there to be
discussed

03:32:08.809 --> 03:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
each of these has sort of a sponsor
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
within the division three is that what
 
03:32:16.130 --> 03:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
you implied with the other
 
03:32:16.140 --> 03:32:17.590 align:start position:0%
you implied with the other
um

03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:19.849 --> 03:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
they were categorized as other for any
 
03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
number of reasons if there was any
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
amount of General funds included no
 
03:32:24.769 --> 03:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
matter how small I put them in other
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay now 29 has no money what's what's
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
going on there I included that one
 
03:32:33.290 --> 03:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
because it converts 21 temporary
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
positions to 21 full-time authorized
 
03:32:35.700 --> 03:32:37.130 align:start position:0%
positions to 21 full-time authorized
okay

03:32:37.130 --> 03:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
so that's a change request that's why it
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.600 --> 03:32:47.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:32:47.290 --> 03:32:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.690 --> 03:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
if you go home and you start to look at
 
03:32:52.130 --> 03:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
it and think about it and you have
 
03:32:54.170 --> 03:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
questions send the questions to Mr
 
03:32:56.929 --> 03:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
Ripple please
 
03:32:58.330 --> 03:32:58.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:33:02.929 --> 03:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
any final comments before we end
 
03:33:06.530 --> 03:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh what What's this multi-page
 
03:33:13.370 --> 03:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
document spreadsheet this is just the
 
03:33:15.229 --> 03:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
packet that contains the backup for
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
everything on the larger sheet so these
 
03:33:19.490 --> 03:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
are all the detailed changes that will
 
03:33:21.530 --> 03:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
be made in the budget for anything that
 
03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
you adopt on this sheet and the only two
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
that are missing detail right now are
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the sununu center which the department
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
will provide and one of the two
 
03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital items which they'll
 
03:33:34.849 --> 03:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:36.889 --> 03:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
and you have you are these on the LBA
 
03:33:37.969 --> 03:33:37.979 align:start position:0%
site as well
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
not yet but I will post them this
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you representative
 
03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you representative
Waller

03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
Waller
 
03:33:45.530 --> 03:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
just very quickly I just wanted to ask
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
Nathan on the um line 2122 the system of
 
03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:52.490 align:start position:0%
Nathan on the um line 2122 the system of
care

03:33:52.490 --> 03:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
that must be more than three percent
 
03:33:58.849 --> 03:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.450 --> 03:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
or maybe it is three percent is it I I
 
03:34:05.210 --> 03:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
can't answer that uh right off the top
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
of my head
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I know that those contracts are north
 
03:34:10.130 --> 03:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars collectively
 
03:34:10.140 --> 03:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars collectively
combined

03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
combined
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so I will have to get back to you on
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
that my assumption is yes
 
03:34:24.130 --> 03:34:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I think we've covered everything we
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
can cover and we need to head over to
 
03:34:31.010 --> 03:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
reps Hall if we're going to go do our
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
duties over there before we go are there
 
03:34:36.769 --> 03:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
any comments or observations questions
 
03:34:36.779 --> 03:34:38.510 align:start position:0%
any comments or observations questions

03:34:41.929 --> 03:34:41.939 align:start position:0%
remember Mr White uh what one um one
 
03:34:44.450 --> 03:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
quick thing that that I I would ask
 
03:34:46.729 --> 03:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
um the committee before Friday if you
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
can please let me know if there are any
 
03:34:50.330 --> 03:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
specific and right now I'll plan to have
 
03:34:52.250 --> 03:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
Henry here I'll plan to have Katie here
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
but if there are any other areas where
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
you want to delve into the details a
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
little bit please let me know and I'll
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that the division director is
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
here for those conversations
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you have anything else
 
03:35:07.250 --> 03:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
Miss Europa you got something for us
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
before we go we're we're out Tuesday we
 
03:35:12.290 --> 03:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
don't get any Governor's coffee tomorrow
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
I think representative representative
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
the potential for Friday morning if
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's a go and tonight if it's at 10
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
o'clock or okay so whatever I'm doing
 
03:35:24.889 --> 03:35:24.899 align:start position:0%
Friday morning this is more important so
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'll I I can start as soon as possible
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I think we were reserving Friday
 
03:35:32.090 --> 03:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
mornings because I usually had double
 
03:35:34.190 --> 03:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
bookings so if I'm the only problem
 
03:35:37.250 --> 03:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
let's start earlier okay does Friday at
 
03:35:38.809 --> 03:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
nine work
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone here that does not or
 
03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
should not start at 9 00 a.m due to
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
concern about travel on Friday 9 A.M no
 
03:35:47.880 --> 03:35:51.469 align:start position:0%
concern about travel on Friday 9 A.M no
