which on the house Flor FL it originally

went to the house floor as

OTP that's why we have it
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
ballpark so is anybody have any comments
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
on this on the the the bill itself yes
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chair we have um one of the uh Co

sponsor primary sponsor uh could we
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
please thank you representative Muriel
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
Hall represent Bo in hopkington and all
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
the gr Staters um this bill was put
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
forth uh after last year's bill that we
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
had with HB 572 that passed the house on
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
a two 10 to 177 Vote or something and
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
right now that Bill at 300% of poverty
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
sits in the Senate they tabled it so it
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
sit there um so what we'd like to do
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
122 again it's about feeding kids uh I
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
taught for 40 years uh kids have to have
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
food uh to be able to uh learn
 
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 align:start position:0%
appropriately um I think we all have
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
copies of this bill
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
too yes um what we're hoping to do with
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
with this bill or the other bill is to
 
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
um amend it in some way at some point to
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
cause the art Ellison bill I don't know
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
if you're all familiar with art has been
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
a champion for kids feeding kids um he
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
right now is in hospice and our goal
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
would be if this were to pass that it
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be the art Ellison bill I mean
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
he's just passionate about it uh
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
there'll be an article in the paper I
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
think coming out on on his passion for
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
kids um as far as the financial part of
 
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
this um I think you've got the fiscal
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
note from the doe uh it's I think as
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
they do a fiscal note and you know more
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
about this than I do um that they try to
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
look at the highest potential of what
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to go I think we had 60 65%
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh participation in the school meals
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
which went up from what it originally
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
was during the pandemic when it with
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
universal meals um so they they put it
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
in there their financial note and I
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
probably can't answer to those questions
 
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 align:start position:0%
um Mr desay behind me probably knows
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
more about it than I do
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
um and I think they had said 50
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
million um oh I thought I had it here
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
but I guess I don't but um I I think
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
your fiscal notes in front of you
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
so um that's where we're at with it's
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
about feeding kids and we find that to
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
priority Micky is this on the on the
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
finan notice say reimbursement to
 
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
districts 50 million is that including
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
what we're currently doing or is this an
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
addition to what we're currently
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
doing this would be incremental to
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
current law so this would be a new
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
expense for the state above and beyond
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay question Dan just one question does
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note represent just the
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
actual cost of providing lunch or also
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
the cost on funding schools through the
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know education
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
formula this is just for the meal
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement this uh
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
um different from when we've talked
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
about this before of uh School nutrition
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility changing adequacy that was
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
in the context of when we were talking
 
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.630 align:start position:0%
in the context of when we were talking
about

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh Medicaid direct CT would increase the
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
f&amp;r populations and that Dynamic would
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
have impacted adequacy this bill here I
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
I don't believe will have any impact on
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
the Ed funding formula on ad quacy these
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursements yes if Mickey could you
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that a little because you know
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
the formula is based on the number of
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
kids eligible for free and clear and
 
00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:16.079 align:start position:0%
unless we are having this bill just
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
change one and not affect the formula
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know I I just want to make sure I
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
understand exactly which is which my
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is the adequacy is based
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
on the federal definition of fnr whereas
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is expanding the state definition
 
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
of who were reimbursing for for expanded
 
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
meals so that's why it doesn't impact
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
level I'm
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
just I'm assuming they use the same
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
formula same I think it's 130 for free
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
and 185% for reduced of federal poverty
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
correct and and this would increase to
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
did you have a
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
comment go ahead only my comment is
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
since covid we've seen um an increase in
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
the number of hungry children this uh
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
bill would only refer to one meal a day
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
am I
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
correct up to two two meals a day okay
 
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.150 align:start position:0%
correct up to two two meals a day okay
thank

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
you well what's the pleasure of the
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee oh okay thank you um you may
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to this but I'm
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
curious um the programs in place what is
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
the why they why do they need three new
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
positions to new staff positions I don't
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
know if you know that but someone
 
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.310 align:start position:0%
know if you know that but someone
perhaps

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
might I wish I knew that answer it seems
 
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
like an awful lot of people for a
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
computer program that cost
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and then you need three people
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
to manage that and I think I said in my
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
committee that I I know a lot of
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
teachers that would like those jobs I
 
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
think for three people to manage it but
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
orbe it for me to to know how many but
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're right it's they've they're asking
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
for three people in addition to the
 
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.269 align:start position:0%
for three people in addition to the
program

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
so I think you you share
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
my opinion too oh seems like a lot of
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
people yes can I just um I'd like to
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
motion and ought to pass motion um I I
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
would like today for us to be able to
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know if Art's listening
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
today or not um but it would sure be
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
nice if I could leave here today and and
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
go up to see him um the conquered
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
hospice and let him know that this at
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
least got through the first round of the
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal division 2 committee um that his
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
bill this is near and at his heart and
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
it's many families would benefit from
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
this it's different from the direct
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid certification um increases the
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
percentage much like we've done with the
 
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
efas and and and that passed and I think
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
it would be good to have a comparable Mo
 
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh move toward that percentage so I
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
would like to move to I to pass this
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
amendment uh this
 
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.910 align:start position:0%
amendment uh this
bill

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
second comment May um I still had
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
questions but obviously we can talk
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
during a motion too so I'm trying to
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
understand I remember when I was on the
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
school board in wiam that we were um
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
extremely frustrated with the u rules
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
and limitations imposed by the federal
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
launch program that you had to follow
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
guidelines which frankly resulted in a
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
humongous amount of food waste you were
 
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
not allowed to let kid not take the
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
Apple when they didn't want it you had
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
to give them the apple and you would see
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
them throw it in the trash 10 yards
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
later but if you didn't give them the
 
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
Apple then you'd violate the federal
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines and you wouldn't get
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
reimburse so I'm trying to understand I
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
saw note here right that you know
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
schools can either choose to participate
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the federal lunch program or not but
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
if not we are going to be on the hook
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
for the entire tab
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
so is you know what's what's going to
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
happen again when schools say hey the
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
state will pay us I don't have to take
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
those rules I can just get off the
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
federal lunch program give the kids
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
better food because frankly we wanted to
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
give them better food and now I'm not
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
losing any federal funds because the
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
state will Jump Right In wouldn't that
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
affect the FED fiscal note on this the
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note probably assumes no change
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
in that I'm obviously I'm looking for
 
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
in that I'm obviously I'm looking for
anybody's

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
anybody's
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
opinion you have an answer well I have I
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
have a response I think um uh Mr chair
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
the the question comes from a great
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
place but it's it's um centered perhaps
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
more in the substance of the policy
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
which has already been passed by the
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
floor so I think if we're talking about
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact we understand you know um
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
there is going to be some waste in every
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
program that's just a you know part of
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
what the unfortunate you know outcome of
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
many government programs is that
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a little bit of you
 
00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a little bit of you
know

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
government waste that's what it is um so
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
I I respectfully acknowledge your
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
concern about wasted apples but I don't
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
think that's probably it's probably a
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
diminus amount compared to the overall
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
program so I'm not sure that that is
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
really an important
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you I would like to
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
point out that I'm in no way questioning
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
policy my question is about the impact
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
on that policy and the effect it has on
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note because if the fiscal
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
note assumes that schools will continue
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
to stay in the S programs when we change
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
their incentives and remove a burden
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
limitation that caused them to stay on
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
the federal program when they were
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
unhappy with it like wiam was definitely
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
unhappy with that then the fiscal note
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
likely severely underrates the impact it
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
will have because if instead of just
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
have to paying the increment from 300 to
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
350 now for every school that comes out
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
of the federal and moves into the state
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
only program now I'm going to have to
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
pay the full tab so it was purely fiscal
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
note discussion I'd like to assure my
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
distinguished colleague because you know
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
here we hear from the Department I think
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
the department is here they could give
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
us some accuracy on that response okay
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair I think it might also be
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to hear the department talk
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
about their estimates for the
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
conservative lunch only um price instead
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
of you know maybe that difference if it
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
were a breakfast price
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Melissa white
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
division director for learner support at
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
Education Kelly Rambo Bureau
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
administrator for wellness and Nutrition
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
department of education to speak to the
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh question about the Staffing so so
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
this is to develop is to develop a brand
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
new system and Implement a new system in
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
which we do not currently have in place
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to do an income
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
verification process in order to verify
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
the students on this program met the
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements we cannot use
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
any of the federal forms for this
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
program because that is not allowed by
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
the Fed so we'd have to develop our own
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
process these um positions that we're
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
looking at two would be in the um office
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
of wellness and ntion programs and then
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
one position in the data um division to
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
do the verification doing the um monthly
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
processing because the way that the food
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
and service program works is very
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
different than the other Federal
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
programs and that it's a monthly
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system so this isn't just
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
a oneandone or something that we're
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
doing once a year this is a payment
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
process that we would have to conduct on
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis and so that is why there
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
is the need for the Staffing positions
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to run that we cannot use the
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
positions that are federally funded to
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
operate the federal program to run this
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
program so the current staff that we
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
have now in the food and nutrition
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
programs is funded federally for the
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
most part and so that is why we're going
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
to have to have um generally funded
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
positions working on this because this
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
is a state program not a federal program
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies the need for for those
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
positions and then with regards to would
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
that make a change to um perhaps
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
incentivizing um you know coming off of
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
the federal programs we cannot
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate that but if it laa decided to
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
no longer operate a federal uh school or
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
food program because the state is
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
covering it I mean the way that the
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is drafted the state would
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
be required to cover those cost costs
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you I appreciate the
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
clarification I just basically
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand then that the fiscal note
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
assumes as I expected that no change
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
will happen in the school behavior and
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
therefore if any schools do decide to go
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
at this point in time they are not
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
included any of those changes are not
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
included in the fiscal
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
note right just clarifying that I heard
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you so much that's
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
correct yes thanks I just wanted to ask
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
a followup about the previous statement
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
um for the three um additional um
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
positions uh I I just noticed that um if
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
you divide by three it's well over six
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
figures for a position does that include
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits or are we just
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
talking salary benefits and then all the
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
costs that are required to have a
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
position things like a a computer a
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
monthly doat charge everything that is
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
kind of the infrastructure in housing
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
that position great thank you and then
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
um could I just ask additional follow
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
um the um so my understanding if uh we
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
look at the USDA income eligibility
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines um so the state would be
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
required to pay the balance of the
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
reduced price um meals for students
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
qualifying right so we're looking at the
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
Delta between what the federal
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
government currently pays to what the
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
additional payment would be for you know
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
an additional meal or additional
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
qualification so the federal funding is
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
assumed that we would continue that and
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
then the state would make up the
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
addition that's correct it's the
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
difference between between the two of
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
them that's correct great thank you so
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's not only the 186 to 350% but it's
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
also the reduced price meal the
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
remaining balance on that reduced price
 
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
meal so you have a student that has a
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
reduced price meal because they're
 
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
between the 131 and the 185 we'd be
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
covering the difference of that as as
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
well and that's included in uh the
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um it's my
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are a number of
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
other states that are doing this and
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
there are also a number of states that
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
have picked up a universal uh feeding
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
program for their children in their
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
state do you can you um give me any
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
information about those the community
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
eligible uh provision program so would
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
you be thank you for the question um
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
would you be speaking to the community
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility program or a universal meal
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
program meaning that the state would
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
just do just that cover the difference
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's my understanding that
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and a couple of other
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
states have have picked that up as um an
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
offering that they provide to their
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
public schools and public charter
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
schools so that is correct um and each
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
state is uh unique and different how
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're administering that um I don't
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
have that information off the top of my
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
head but there are other states that are
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
um participating in a program such as
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
that and just a followup um I just
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to continue go too far a field
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
listic with this build okay okay with
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
with the community eligible provision
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
programs the way that those operate is
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
that if you're looking at a community
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
that has a significant number of free
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
and reduced qualified students let's say
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
80% and so you're not going to collect
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to use some other metric
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
for measuring poverty in that community
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
and so the local um coverage is the 20%
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
whereas the feds are covering that 80%
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have many communities that meet
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
that qualification and so even though
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
the federal government expanded that to
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
I think it was the 40 40 to 25% so that
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
so that 25 to 40% if you're having that
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
kind of measurement in your community so
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
let's say if they have that 25% the
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
local is still having to cover that 75%
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
so the F will cover the 25 the local
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
covers the 75 and then you have
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
everybody that's able to partake in that
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
program so we just make it very clear
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
that when we're talking about this this
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
works out well for communities that have
 
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
very large numbers of free and reduced
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
and large numbers of poverty percentages
 
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
that they're able to look to but when
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
you have a community that doesn't have
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
that we caution that because it does
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
fall upon that local um agency to cover
 
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
the cost and if they have the ability to
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
do that then it works well okay Mar yes
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
do we have an estimate of the number of
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
of families number of students this
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
would apply to that would get gathered
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
into this new program so this was the
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
part that we weren't able to give you an
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
exact number on we had to do an estimate
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
based on looking at the communities and
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
that percentage uh based on the um US
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau data that would meet that
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
18 5 to
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
350% and that's where we came up with
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
the projected 50 million based on that
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
have and so the the 50 um million that's
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
listed on the fiscal note is the minimum
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
um amount just to to clarify for that
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
too so um and these numbers are based
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
upon um the total enrollment of every
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
single student within the state um that
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
would have the cap ability to partake in
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
this program well the question was
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's 150,000 some students correct
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
how many are already free and reduced
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
and how many more are going to be added
 
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
so what we have is the actual that are
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
free and reduced and that's um about
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
40,000 currently right now um without
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
having the eligibility data um we we
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
can't um confidently answer that
 
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
question don't have the data to answer
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to go back to your last
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
response about the 50 million being a
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate I'm looking at the
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
calculation in the fiscal note which
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
said that it was based on providing
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
lunch uh for those 160,000 students and
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
if I look earlier in the in the note it
 
00:24:53.789 --> 00:24:53.799 align:start position:0%
is mentioned that the lunch cost is
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
actually quite a bit more than a
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
breakfast cost so so it's entirely
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
plausible that a student may only get
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
one meal a day and it may in fact be
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
breakfast so I'm not sure that this is
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
possible I'm going to say based on the
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
fact this came out of the policy
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
itl uh I'm I'm not going to be able to
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
support the
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
OTP yes thank you Mr chair I'm not sure
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
whether this question is for the deal do
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
we Representatives or Micky
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
but um do we have a number on how much
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
money do we get Statewide from the
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
federal lunch
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
program Statewide all schools ballpark
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
number um thank you for the question so
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
in um let's just say the past um fiscal
 
00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
year it was about $50 million with all
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
of the programs that we operate within
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
the department um and that could be
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
breakfast lunch um our fresh fruits and
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
million okay we have a motion Ma and
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
seconded for as o OTP could we just get
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
clarification on the comment about it
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
that it came out of a committee with the
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
itl it came to the house it came to the

00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
1570 uh had originally a bunch of money
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
in it the money disappeared so there's
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
no money in it but and we wanted the
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
department of education to be able to go
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
to fiscal and request money for this uh
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
inventory of school
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
buildings however the language was not
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the bill to allow them to do that so
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing um
 
00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:15.909 align:start position:0%
I'm introducing um
Amendment

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%

00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.630 align:start position:0%
Amendment

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
1037
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
H which allows the Department of
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
Education to go to fiscal to request
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
funds for this
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
inventory could I ask that a section be
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
added to this amendment please um can
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry motion I need I need to get
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
a second I'll have a second okay now
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're on I I would like to ask that um
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
within this amendment we add a provision
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
that um the funds that are in building
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:59.149 align:start position:0%
 
non-aps

00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
non-aps
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
non-linguists they're non-aps to make
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
them non-aps that means that I I know I
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
know what it means but you just said
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
they are non-aps I believe that
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
huh yeah and I would prefer with we get
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
so few dollars now for building Aid that
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
if they were non-aps and that at least
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
if there are funds left in the account
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
that they could carry forward to the
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
next bium right now they're disappearing
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
bium so that is correct School building
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
gate is non-lps until the end of the
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
bium any unexpended funds would go back
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund and then be
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
budgeted Appropriations and the
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
following year so they go back to the
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
education trust fund correct and that's
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
non-aps you correct yeah so the funds
 
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.149 align:start position:0%
non-aps you correct yeah so the funds
are

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
non-aps so
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
well yeah they lapse from the authority
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the school building Aid line into the
 
00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
education trust fund at the end of the
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
banum and I'm not sure perhaps Amy would
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
know how much is lapsed each year I
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
can't imagine it's much but I don't
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
maybe Amy Clark from doe could share a
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of the history
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:33.389 align:start position:0%
little bit of the history
please

00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Amy Clark
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education in the
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau of school facilities um and yes
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
we have had funds laps um well we've
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
been in a moratorium for a really long
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
time so it's not like we've been through
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
many uh bium that We've Ended We've
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
Ended twice one I think if I recall it
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
was like
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
$700,000 that lapsed um so
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
um so not having that lapse would be
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
tacked on to the next uh fund which
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
helpful any other comment yes well most
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
of that education uh building fund is
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
going to pay off
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
bonds or at least a lot of it was so
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
that the bond payments continue so
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's always the money in there to pay
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bond payments and normally the
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
decisions for building Aid are made when
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
the budget comes out not sub quently
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
usually included in the budget isn't
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
that true um so there's a cap the law
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
currently caps building Aid at $50
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
million per year so I think what
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
representative Heath correct me if I'm
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
wrong what you're asking is that you
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
have that cap of 50 million plus
 
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
whatever um lapses at the end you be
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
have that non-aps so you'd still be able
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
to do this 50 million cap plus that
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
700,000 in that example so that in the
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
end you'd have an additional $700,000
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
for new projects in that particular
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
scenario exactly does anybody have any
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
objection to that addition
 
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.909 align:start position:0%
objection to that addition
yes

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair yes I if I could just
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for the opposite position for a
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
moment I mean I think we've already had
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
the discussion this year and I think
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
there is a bill on the table about
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
building Aid and the fact that there are
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know 450 buildings in our state that
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
are currently you know in various states
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
of disrepair which we're not exactly
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
sure as to the specific condition but we
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
do know that the
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelming fiscal responsibility of
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
the state to try to meet the current
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
need that we know about uh is not
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
currently being met with the 50 million
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
a year so I do think if it's the
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
intention every bium to allocate 50
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
million and that to building Aid
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
regardless of the tail which we all know
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
is dwindling um that the remainder of
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
whatever is left at the end of the bium
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
could stay and be allocated for the
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
following year since we all know that
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
that list of current applicants for
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid it gets longer every year
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
instead of getting shorter so I think
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
that that demonstrates there is an
 
00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:05.870 align:start position:0%
that that demonstrates there is an
ongoing

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
need yes Pur we also have a bill before
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
us to assess all the school buildings in
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
the state I think this is premature to
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
start talking about putting more money
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
into building a until we see what the
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
the needs are I think until we see that
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
assessment and I think you may have
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
something to do with it that we don't
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
know what what kind of thing I'm also in
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
Ed in how wellmaintained some of these
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
buildings are some people don't do any
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance and then say hey give me a
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
new building and that's another thing
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
we'd like to discover if you're not
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
taking care of what we gave you don't
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
come asking for new thank you well I
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
I I'm for moving things along quite
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
honestly I think that's a a very good
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment but not
 
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.990 align:start position:0%
Amendment but not
now

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
now
okay

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:06.069 align:start position:0%
okay
comment

00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes I'd like to address the bill 1570
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
and this amendment which addresses the
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
need to know what represent wer just
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
spoke to is what's out in the field in
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
terms of construction new renovation
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
emergency projects what projects really
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
need uh support a building Aid so we can
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
put this 10-year plan into effect where
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
we know as a legislature what we have to
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate what are the needs out there
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
in the field now one thing I am
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about here is that we're
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
talking now about a vendor to a
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
contracted service of the department to
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
go out and with architect engineer to
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
assess what's in the field so we have a
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
good report coming back the same
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
criteria used wherever they go so we
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
don't get conflicting information
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
it's important that uh we realize that
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a contract and we may
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
have several contracts who knows and we
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
have about 33 million feet square feet
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
of buildings out there right now K
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
through 12 you multiply that times the
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
15 cents per square foot to do this
 
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
contracted that representative wer just
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
spoke to that comes out to roughly a
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
little shallow of $5 million $5 million
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
right there I would say that this money
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
this 5 million apart from what you're
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
doing with building Aid that should not
 
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.550 align:start position:0%
doing with building Aid that should not
be

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
lapsing uh that money right there you
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
may have a contract you're coming to the
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
end of that two-year period which you
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
want to you may have funds encumbered
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
but we need to ensure that we have the
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
ability to do this properly and to carry
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
those monies forward to finish the job
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
so if you have a may have another
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
contractor you have to let and that's
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
right at the end of that two two million
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
two twoe period and you need to get that
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
contract going but may not have cumbered
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
anything yet it should be non-aps I'm
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the $5 million I'm not
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
talking about up to 50 million or
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
wherever you are per year so that's my
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
short presentation on that one right now
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with this bill right here this
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
portion should be
 
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.349 align:start position:0%
portion should be
non-aps

00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
non-aps
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
so I would
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
assume this is a
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
question I assume when ad administrative
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
Services Cuts these contracts that are
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
multi-year and funded in the in the
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
initial year that that that encumbers
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
those funds for the rest of that
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
contract is that a reasonable assumption
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
well I I can respond I also chair the
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
commission which is for public school
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure which we deal with access
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
and security and various safety
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
components and communicating with
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
emergency responders we've come to the
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
point where we've had
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
issues with money coming back we've had
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
then how do we reallocate that that
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
particular money they do not lapse and
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
we found that due to the fact that
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
during when we went through covid the
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
costs of doing business what we had
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
originally estimated came on sometimes
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
even double what we from the contractors
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
because we we couldn't find the
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
contractors but we needed to get the job
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
done for security and safety in the
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
schools I don't this that's just a
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
parallel where we have one program which
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
fun monies don't lapse this program is
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
one where we just need to know what's
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
out in the field I don't see any harm
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
and saying we're allocating $5 million
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
yes but the money won't lapse until we
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
finish doing the job and it could extend
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the the two-year
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
period so I'll do two amendments I I
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
don't know that's up to you guys to do
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
the Amendments as far as the lapsing
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
concern for the contract dollars that to
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
to implement the assessment this
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
amendment here would allow the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
department to come to fiscal to get
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
money for the remainder of fiscal 25
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
your budget that leads us to the next
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
budget so next spring budget writers the
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
department should bring forward their 20
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 and fiscal 27 costs associated
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
with this contract and budget writers
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
would consider it then so you wouldn't
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
have to worry about a lapsing provision
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
today I trust you the check's in the
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
mail but um so it just actually the
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
check check isn't written yet yeah I
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
know the check's not written yet but
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely a program we we need
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
you all right so we have a motion made
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
and seconded on Amendment
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
137h all those in favor of the amendment
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
to allow education to go to fiscal to
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
ask for money raise your
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
hands 9 Z so it's unanimous can I just
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
ask a clarifying question about the am
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just approved uh the
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like the
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
um ability to go to fiscal will be
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
available each year after the initial
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
assessment is that right or the initial
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
authorization uh the authorization in
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph one is for fiscal 25 only yeah
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
and then in fiscal 26 in year each year
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
thereafter it would be the expectation
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
that the department would put the amount
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
needed in their agency budget request
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
essentially and then it would be up to
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
just the normal budgeting process thank
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
you okay so now we have to have a a roll
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
call on 1570 as
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
amended and we need a motion first like

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
you okay as we did discuss this last
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
Thursday and with the idea we're going
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
to come back and discuss it some more
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
here here we are the the amendment that
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm proposing is
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
105h does not change the under the the
 
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.710 align:start position:0%
105h does not change the under the the
approved

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
1583 that was approved by the house the
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
only thing it changes is the ad adequacy
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
statements so all of the other targeted
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
funds for the right hand side of the
 
00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:53.190 align:start position:0%
funds for the right hand side of the
formula

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
remain what this what F what the
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
amendment does is the amendment does
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
three things it raises the adequacy to
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
$735 and one cent as suggested by the
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
judge in the
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
conal uh
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
judgment so I'm assuming he had wisdom
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
to come up with that number so I adopted
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
that number as the top
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
number what this does is it increases
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of funds that need to be paid
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
out as part of
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy and so the second the funding
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the additional funds is basically
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
coming from the the Ed
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
education educ but the the additional
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
funds are coming from the
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
communities we we currently as a as a
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
state specify how much has to be devoted
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
to education all we're doing is we're
 
00:44:57.309 --> 00:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
taking that number we're making a little
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
bit bigger so that in I'll pick on
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
Hampton in Hampton I've got on my tax
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill local education taxes and swep what
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
happens is the swept number is going to
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
go up and the local education number is
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to go down because the part two of
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
this bill says you can't increase your
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation so what that says is you
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
can't as the swep increases and your
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
your appropriation numbers here and you
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
have less money you can't recharge the
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
battery so to speak so it preempts that
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
unless you happen to be a swept
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
Community that's
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
budgeting as Hampton
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
is keeping
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
swept in that event Hampton will be able
 
00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
to increase their local education
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
assessments based on the difference in
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
the swep they're not going to get
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
anymore so that is uh part one is the
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy part two of this bill is the
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
I'll call it a ceiling for the sake of
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
another word and part three of this is
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
the uh swept going back to the state
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
excess swept going back to the state
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
there will be more communities currently
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 29 million goes back to
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
the state will be coming back to the
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
state currently it's held in the local
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
communities what this says is is all
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
that sweat money including Hampton comes
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
back to the state under this amendment
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
the swep that return to the state is now
 
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:36.710 align:start position:0%
the swep that return to the state is now
90

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
90
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
million however majority of communities
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
are not in it's they're not going to
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
know the difference because they're
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
never had the swep funds in their budget
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
to begin
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
with so yes thank you for that summary
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
um I just noticed that the number at the
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
top of this amendment differs from the
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
top of the amendment number that you
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
gave us last week so I was wondering if
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
you could tell us the difference between
 
00:47:01.599 --> 00:47:02.470 align:start position:0%
you could tell us the difference between
the

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
two I can answer that the only
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
difference between Amendment 0913 from
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
last week and this one is the effective
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
date there was a effective date
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
you comments yes um there are a number
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
of things that go along with this
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment um I certainly support
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly the increase to
 
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:28.190 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly the increase to
7,356

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
7,356
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
um this
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is a lot in terms
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
of thinking across our communities um I
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
really and truly think a a an amendment
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
of this magnitude needs a hearing a
 
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing um that said um swept it
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
raises um we're going from 363 million
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
um and the Rand we we know what the Rand
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
um hearing of the the Rand decision has
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
told us um but what does this really
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
look like in a local community and and
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear Mickey to walk walk
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
through this amendment um the other
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
thing that concerns me greatly we've not
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
seen a penalty before and within this
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
amendment there is a penalty for not
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
submitting the funds in the excess web
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
towns um so I think that that's
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
something that we that we need to
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit better and I
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
think communities need to understand
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
that a little bit
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
better but the other thing that that
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
also concerns me is that while yes um
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
the we're moving the amount to
 
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.270 align:start position:0%
the we're moving the amount to
$735

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
$735
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
And1 for that year but then it becomes
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
regressive and the amount starts to
 
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.390 align:start position:0%
regressive and the amount starts to
decline

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if maybe Mickey maybe
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding this right so if
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
Mickey you could walk through the
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and and talk about that and I
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
I would hope that um Mr chair that you
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
would consider a public hearing on this
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendment so that people could everybody
 
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
that this impacts which is our whole
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
state would somehow um have an
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
understanding so that everybody's aware
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
before we take action on
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
this okay part one of her
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
reest so I think the highlights of the
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
bill were were covered to this point
 
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
so you see the bill um amends section
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
one of the underlying bill which uh
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1583 as it passed the house
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
and came to this committee also had
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
changed base adequacy beginning in
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 up to 4404 I believe this
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
would increase it to the 33561 the
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
conval number and then everything else
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
in this amendment starting on line 8 is
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
after House Bill 1583 it came to so the
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
relief funding and the fiscal capacity
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid is still intact under this
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
amendment yes but how what is the
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
regression of the amount the
 
00:50:11.309 --> 00:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
7,000 as it goes as the years progress
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
so could you explain that part please so
 
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.549 align:start position:0%
so could you explain that part please so
the

00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
73561 uh the base adequacy as well as
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
the other differentiated Aid components
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
by law would increase actually 2% per
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
year each year after this so when you
 
00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
year each year after this so when you
say

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.510 align:start position:0%
say
regress

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
regress
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
or yeah the 73561 per pupil will
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
increase by 2% each year so it would be
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
going up it'd be going up it would not
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
be regressive at all correct correct
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so the components of just
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
by the nature of the formula that we
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
have now U where you can kind of see
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
some Aid components go down they're in
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
the targeted AIDS which are based on
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
equalized valuations and as equalized
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
valuations increase in reality um by
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
amounts greater than you know we've seen
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
like 18% as high as some years um I
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
think the average for the last 40 years
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
is around 7% um statutorily those only
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
increase by 2% so you do see some
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
regression in that regard but that's way
 
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
into the weeds probably for what we're
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
talking about today um did you want me
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
to continue through the amendment or do
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
I feel like you've covered most things
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
but I can revisit or if you if I if I
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
gaps you recognize fill them in I I
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
think you I think you covered most
 
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
everything with with when you
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted I just wanted to reiterate
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
that the 1583 Provisions are unaffected
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
by this the question um here um and I
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
believe maybe I'm reading it wrong
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh it if in fact a school district
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
chooses to um increase the amount of
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
money that they choose to spend they
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
need a 2third vote of their legislature
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
yes they their governing body right so
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
um this is why I think we need a public
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
hearing so so that means in my mind in
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester it would be the board of
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
Mayor and all men could just do that
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
whenever they wanted to but it would be
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
town meeting day the community would now
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
basically so that's basically this is
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
just reiterating the fact that a town on
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
a yearly basis approves their budget and
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's what this means
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
yeah if they exceed the the limits that
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
are stated in this bill they would need
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
that two-thirds in that vote and just my
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
final question is about the penalty
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
we've I don't remember ever um a penalty
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
for a person that refuses to remit the
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
excess swept that a penalty would be um
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
either they their adequacy could be um
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
attached and any other state funds um
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
could be withheld
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
can you talk a little bit about
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
that uh I off the top of my head I'm not
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
aware of any other such uh Provisions in
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
law but I also I can't say for sure if
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
existed yeah I think I can address the
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
fallacy with that there'd be nothing to
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
locally but they are required Now by law
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
to put up to that's correct
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
but you said you said right and what you
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
said was if they refused to then the
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
state could attach their adequacy
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
there's no adequacy to attach because
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
they collect it locally you're still
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
them Mr
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
chair um so the way I read it on page
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
three um so this is section Roman
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
numeral one subsection C and
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
D basically the commissioner of Dr can
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
petition the state treasurer to withhold
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
the rooms and meals distribution if a
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
municipality is delinquent on their
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
excess payment to the state which would
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
be collected now double the
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
amount under the new calculation right
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then under D the commissioner of the
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
Dr could withhold any State education
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
Aid in
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
including the adequacy payments to
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
school districts of any
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
municipality if the Dr reports them
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
delinquent on submitting that excess
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
swept now um so as I read
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
it it's not just the adequacy But it
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
includes adequacy that could be withhold
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
withheld it could be any State education
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
AIDS so I I think that word any is a
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
little scary that we may need to have a
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing because now we're
 
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
suddenly putting forth not just adequacy
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
as a penalty and not just meals and
 
00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:01.870 align:start position:0%
as a penalty and not just meals and
rooms

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
distribution but special ed building Aid
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we could go down the list of
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know those items in the education
 
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund that we all know exist so
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty big deal this um this
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
stick not carrot is a pretty big
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
stick yes if I may M thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind everyone that the
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
penalties here would be for or when a
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
town willing willfully disobeys state
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
law which um let's just assume that we
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
won't leave to see that happen because
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
this would not be fun at all two if a
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
town willfully disobeys state law which
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
I believe highly unlikely literally all
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
this bill says is that if they don't
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
want to pay me my whatever it is $1
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
million then we with withheld that
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the same place and
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
the town is literally unharmed because
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
they don't get a million on the left but
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
they kept the million on the right sorry
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm pointing the wrong ways as I see
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
this as I say this but you know I mean
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
there is literally nothing in this law
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
that will take one cent from a town that
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
willfully disobeys Town state law why
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
are we even worried about it I would be
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
more more worried about a town who
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
chooses to disobey state law and frankly
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
if we are going to talk about the
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
penalties I would suggest penalties that
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
actually hurt not penalties that just
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
say oh you don't want to do this oh geez
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm going to take the money from
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and make sure you don't
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
lose a scent we are extremely lean in
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
this because it is a change I I'm fine
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the legislation as is right and
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'll support it but I I don't think the
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
concerns over the penalties are
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
something that would U warrant a lot of
 
00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
consideration since the penalties are
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
essentially inexistent we just write
 
00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:48.069 align:start position:0%
essentially inexistent we just write
that

00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
wrong does it State anywhere uh the
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
extent of the penalties because I don't
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
see any cap on the penalty here so
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to tell me that they
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
would withhold only what the excess is
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
and I also wonder why does it go to um
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
include meals in rooms uh to me that
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
just seems a little Draconian if we're
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
looking around for education programs I
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
Dr just just explain some of the
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
mechanics of what happens if a town is
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
not complying with state law so if a
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
town was required to pay the state money
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
and they did not pay the state the money
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
the state's option would be to sue them
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
so so that would be the normal course of
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
action and then the town would probably
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
want to pay that money because if they
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
lost the lawsuit the state could then
 
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
say you got to pay our attorney fees Etc
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the normal course of action
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
but litigation as you know can take time
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
so putting a um um we do this with doe2
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
reporting um we withhold state adequacy
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
from charter schools and district
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
schools if they do not complete their
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
financial reporting and so the way that
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
works is um they have to submit those
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
reports to us we ask them to do those
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
reports if they are not comping and they
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't submit those reports we say we're
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
going to hold on to your adequacy check
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
you are 100% entitled to it but we're
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
going to hold on to it until you finish
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
the report then we release it um I
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
imagine the same mechanics mechanics
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
would work here um where if a town did
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
not pay their excess swept to the state
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
the state would use uh whatever Aid the
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
state has or it's really up to the uh
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commissioner of Dr
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
discretion of Commissioner of Education
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
um to withhold that so they' be
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
incentivized to pay it before for
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
getting into that litigation aspect of
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
it so it's it's um it's a level of
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
gradation litigation is probably the
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
kind of Last Resort you want to go
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
down can I just have a quick followup
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
sure I think and that makes complete
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
sense Mark I um I just want to
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that when normal litigation
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
takes place um withholding additional
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
funds that are not particular to the
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
damages at you know at issue in the case
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
seems extra Draconian um to steal my
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
colleague's word because um you know you
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't normally in a civil litigation
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
case that I'm aware of um withhold
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
additional funds that are not gerain to
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
the actual case of issue so you know the
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms issue is not an
 
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
educational issue and it's not an issue
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
before a CA before the this court system
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
if there was any litigation over you
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
know these payments or whatever so I
 
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
think you know that that is concerning I
 
00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
think um furthermore I mean it's the
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
state's obligation and these District's
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
obligations to provide an education and
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
if any education Aid can be withheld it
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
may come a point where it's not feasible
 
00:59:44.589 --> 00:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
to have you know education day-to-day
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
management operations of a district if
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have the money to do so just
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
because they're you know missing a small
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
balance so I am worried that this could
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
snowball um
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
and I um I think that clarification
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
would be needed by further Amendment if
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
we were going to go down this road I but
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
I for the record do not feel comfortable
 
01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
I for the record do not feel comfortable
going

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
there you just turned it off I apologize
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's not my day apparently um I just
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
want to quickly address uh the comments
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
from my colleague and just say that if
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
the town is concerned about the lack of
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
State funds preventing the ability to
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
educate kids all they got to do is
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
disburse the money they already
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
collected at that time this is not money
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
they possibly couldn't have collected
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's money they already collected in
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes and it's sitting in their
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
bank account I don't understand why the
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh 10 minutes it takes to per to run a
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
wire transfer to the state are something
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
that the town would want to avoid and
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
endanger the education of the kids I
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
submit to you that no town would do that
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
and therefore this is not a concern that
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
we should spend a lot of di
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
on yes Mary thank you Mr chair
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
so I love 1583 I think it's great as is
 
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
um I there are components of the
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that I
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
like I just I would like to act on
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
1583 just to pass it out of division 2
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
send it over to full finance and then
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
have a public public hearing on the
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and then after that if we
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
could have the um maybe we could have a
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Tuesday morning we
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
could do an amendment to the um calendar
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
and have a public hearing on Tuesday
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
morning when we're all going to be here
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
anyway um before we take a final action
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
on the amendment just I really and truly
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
think this is this is a big deal it's
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
just not some little amendment that that
 
01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
we know about it but everybody doesn't
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
else doesn't know about it and I think
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
there are things
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
that in my experience here it's the
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
normal practice that we have a hearing
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
on an amendment that changes the impact
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
of of a piece of
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislation to a a fairly significant
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
point and and I I really and truly think
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not imagining it um oh ask the
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
it is probably appropriate okay thank
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman then I would I would say
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
we'll do
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
it are you going to be able to finish
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
think no
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
no so at 9
 
01:02:45.799 --> 01:02:48.029 align:start position:0%
no so at 9
o'

01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
o'
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:02:54.839 --> 01:03:01.230 align:start position:0%
Amendment
today

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
well I I don't think 9 o' on Tuesday is
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
the right time okay because that gives
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
us one hour and okay if you're going to
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
hold a public hearing and and you're
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
expecting a crowd I don't think that's
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
the yeah division one is going to meet
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
at one on
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
Wednesday of course Thursday we'll have
 
01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.670 align:start position:0%
Wednesday of course Thursday we'll have
a

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
session well we can have it in the
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
morning on Wednesday okay Wes morning at
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
10 well today's
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
Friday wouldn't get in the calendar well
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
we could do it at a you know they amend
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
it post it with a Amendment a or
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they call it you can do it no I
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
could request yes Mr chair I think there
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
was an amendment rule that allows an
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to the calendar if with
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
three-day notice for a public hearing so
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
if we got it in today before 5 Monday
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Wednesday that's three day
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
notice depends on the clerk and
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes he's obstinate about No it
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
should have been here Wednesday before
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
noon and then we can take a vote on 1583
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
as is so then we it's ready to go to
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
division of the full Finance it's good
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
it'll have to carry the amendment or not
 
01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:13.510 align:start position:0%
it'll have to carry the amendment or not
okay

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay I mean it's possible I know that
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means still has several sweat
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
bills before them as well so it could
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
potentially be Germain to those bills as
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
well I think the swap bills are going
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
going to interim
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
study they are going to interim
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
study but we don't want to attack our I
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
well let's ask the
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
clerk should we take a quick recess to
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk yeah let's take it let's
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
take break until quarter after thank you
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr chairman

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay to answer the question we will
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
schedule a public
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
hearing properly noticed we're not going
 
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
to try to do it next
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
week no
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
because we do because this is a second
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee bill so it's not do back until
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
April 4th so looking at a calendar was
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
The Prudent thing to do to say let's do
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
it right so we will find a time to have
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and then we'll have
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
another work
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
session having said that has anybody
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
else got any thing they want
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
now yeah I have one more concern Mr
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
chair yes uh so on page
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
two subsection
 
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
section I'm a little bit worried
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
about the way that I read it maybe I'm
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
incorrect is that once the appropriation
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
determination for swept is
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
determined it's it's basically locked in
 
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.310 align:start position:0%
determined it's it's basically locked in
and

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
that there isn't an ability to kind of
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
in build out from that so so that I'm a
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
little concerned that some communities
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
who are currently really struggling with
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
their you know property tax issues
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
and school financing issues would really
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
be kind of Frozen in time and ability to
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
address that under the
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
financing and that you know down this
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
threeyear average percent change would
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
really prevent them for making
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
meaningful changes in the future that
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
that does concern me quite a bit no they
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
can the two-third vote right so again I
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
think that you know asking any Community
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's really struggling to reach
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
66% at a town budget meeting to approve
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
a major you know Bond or a major you
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
know change for their you know a real
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental change for the way that they
 
01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
finance our schools you know if they so
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
choose it would be nearly impossible to
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
reach that consensus and currently under
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
law it's just a simple majority so my
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
why would we want to increase a hurdle
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
raise the height for these communities
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
if they are ready to make those changes
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
with a simple majority under current law
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
now why would we want to make it higher
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
and harder for them to make those
 
01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.590 align:start position:0%
and harder for them to make those
changes

01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
comment so I'd like to point out these
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
are the wealthiest communities in the
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
state that already have the highest per
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
pupil spending in the state by huge
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
margins so that is the reason to have
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
there if that's true I'd like to hear
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
from those communities and as well as
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know why would we hand cap or tie
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
their hands from being able to make
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
additional changes if if that's the case
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
I I would be interested in hearing you
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
know from them at this at this hearing
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this is an appropriate
 
01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.430 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this is an appropriate
limitation

01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
like effective limitation through the
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
here yes can I just add quickly I think
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
there's a assuming homogeneity of any
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
particular Community um isn't realistic
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh when I think of some communities um
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
exitor comes to mind which appears to be
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
a wealthy community has a significant
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
amount of poverty in exitor and they
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
struggle with a lot of these things half
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
of their students are on free and
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch so I think assuming
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
homogeneity of communities um that
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
either you're a wealthy community or not
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
misleading I wasn't making any
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
assumptions these are the
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
towns and it'll be true in the even more
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
so in this case that
 
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
so in this case that
have

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.149 align:start position:0%
have
the

01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
largest surpluses if you will that
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
collect more money by
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
they it's the the EXs we Town exactly so
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
is that's not an assumption that's a
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
fact and it's going to get bigger in
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
fact more towns will be involved our our
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
town for instance is a very Middle Town
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes would' probably be a over and
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'd probably be under but
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
under this we be
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
over there were 49 towns that had excess
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
swept before we've added four
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
more like this I thought we'd had more
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
it's only four more it's 53 Towns now
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:44.149 align:start position:0%
some of them
11

01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
not yes Mr chair I just respectfully
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
reserve the right to make Amendment
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
changes after the public hearing just
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
well that's why we're having a public
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you thank you I I I was I
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
was fishing to say is there something
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
glaring that we need to fix now for the
 
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.510 align:start position:0%
glaring that we need to fix now for the
public

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
hearing so let's defer to the public
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
hearing all
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
well that's this is the one where we
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
have the tier the levels of special ed
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
why didn't we why didn't we address this
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
because you gave us that Amendment Mr
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
chair I think we got overloaded s us
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
over the Ed but also I thought there was
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
a disagreement with whether or not the
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
two-year lag numbers the doe could be
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
replaced with like more timely numbers
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
and I think there was going to be some
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
coming back and forth discussing about
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.639 --> 01:21:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
than

01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
so I'll have Brian walk walk through the
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
memo um kind of um this is a new data
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
set we'd be introducing into adequacy so
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
it just took a little bit of time for us
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
to talk with the sped Bureau and figure
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
out how it would would roll into
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
adequacy and if there would be any
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
glitches along the way and so Brian's
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to walk through kind of how
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
adequacy sped currently matches and then
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
how this would change that a little bit
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
and then there was a recommendation uh
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
before the committee or two couple
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
options before the committee as far as
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
how you want to deal with how the sped
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
data rolls into the adequacy
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
formula hi good afternoon as Mark
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned my name is Brian e and I work
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of school Finance with
 
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so I can just
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
quickly walk through how like Mark
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned how sped is currently match
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
for adequacy so how we determine if a
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
student is eligible for special
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
education differential different
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid is essentially
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
determining if a student is eligible for
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy and then matching them to say
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
is this student also receiving special
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
education services if so that student is
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
eligible for that additional sped Aid so
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's how we currently do it so this
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
first section on the hand oute uh bullet
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
two that states that using that method
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
which is current law we identified
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
3,965 sped students for fy2 24 being
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
school year
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
23 so this bill how as it's proposed is
 
01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
that it would instead of um oh and also
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
what's important is that we look at if a
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
student's eligible receiving special
 
01:22:42.189 --> 01:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
education services any time of that year
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not like any point in time it's
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
any time during that school year if they
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
receive those services so um how would
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
change that data matching is that it
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be looking at just any time of
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
the year it'd be looking at those
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
October 1st collection dates which is
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
how they determine what environment
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
those students are in which is those
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
categories a b and c which are on the
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill so therefore any students uh
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
identified as receiving special
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
education services or even entering into
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
a public District in New Hampshire after
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
101 would not be included in those uh
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
what we call headcounts as of October
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
1st so doing that analysis bullet two we
 
01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.470 align:start position:0%
1st so doing that analysis bullet two we
identified

01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
26334 sped students in
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
fy4 which is 4,631 students identified
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
as receiving sped Services after or
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
entering a New Hampshire District uh
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
public school after 101 so that's the
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
discrepancy that we identified that is a
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
technical uh deficiency with the
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
bill so if we were to implement the bill
 
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
as it's written we would be not
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
including those 4,631 students as they
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
aren't identified on those uh October
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
1st headcount um
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
collection and and so as Mark mentioned
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
we have some ideas or a idea we want to
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
propose uh in order to pay ensure that
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
all students receiving special educ
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
education services are receiving special
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
education Aid and that would be the
 
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
language to address this limitation and
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
that would be any pupil receiving
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
special education services identified by
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
the department and was not identified in
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
those October 1st headcount date um
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
headcounts uh to determine those
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
disability categories a b or c those
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
students shall receive Aid under
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
category a so that would take all those
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
students that were mismatched or
 
01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:29.800 align:start position:0%
unmatched essentially uh that were
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the year just not on the
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
October 1st uh collection essentially
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
those students would be receiving aid
 
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
under category a or an aid amount
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
specified by the legislature uh that
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
could be um updated as well so we did
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
the analysis of looking you know if we
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
were to include all those special
 
01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:54.639 align:start position:0%
education um students as of 101 so as
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
received that would be 11 million a year
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
and if we were to add that additional C
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
well add um all those unmatch students
 
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
as category a that would be the second
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
bullet there which would be 17.7 million
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
each year if we were to ensure that
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
every student would be receiving special
 
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
education differentiated Aid under this
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
bill my question is is this is this an
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
anomaly this October one date or is that
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
used for a lot of things it would be
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it's our beginning of year year so
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
just like any other student uh Records
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
that are submitted to the department
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's as of 101 so it kind of follows
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
that same principle um student um status
 
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's we do October one is
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
kind of our beginning of the year count
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
so we use it for forecasting in the
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
future we use that October 1 date is
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
very common but what we do with a lot of
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
other programs like the f&amp;r program is
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
we we say how many f&amp;r students you have
 
01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
October 1 but we're going to check back
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
in with you at the end of the year and
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we haven't talked with it another way
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
to do this um instead of changing the
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
law um would be to ask the sped team to
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
do a second data collection I don't know
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
if they can do that cuz this really well
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to them as far as if
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
they can do a second data collection but
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
they could ask them at the end of the
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
year tell us where you're at um I don't
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
think they do full year reporting at the
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
speed I think they really do snapshot
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
count um so um yeah to to align them
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the other data collection processes
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bed Bureau would have to double
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
their data collection um so I don't know
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
if they're pred to do that or if they
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
have the resources to do that um so yeah
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's just it's a little bit it's a
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
little bit different than our data
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
collection methods we have for some of
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
the other differential Aid components so
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
this says that somebody's going to
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
receive at least a level a yes
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay yes Mary thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
so Federal Law requires a reporting of
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
information about the extent to which
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
students receive services so I think
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing you say is you
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
can't do this with the three categories
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
currently I I don't um I believe it's
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement it's federal
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements that does the
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
October one snapshot of what the
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
disability categories are right as of
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
that date um so any additional data
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
collection would be uh State dat State
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
data collection which would be different
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
so so on your I don't know what you call
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
it now the i4c system that you'd have
 
01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
you can put in more categories so can't
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
you just work with the school dist the
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent and say that they need to
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
come up with the methodology I mean it's
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
very clear what we're asking for that
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
that they would instead of reporting one
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
they'd be be reporting three categories
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
of special ed students and the money
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be driven by
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
that so yeah we have we have data
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
collection um uh we have a data
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
collection tool we have I4
 
01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be transition to
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
Alma um we wouldn't be able to do that
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
right away building a whole new data
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
collection system because that's there's
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
the there's the data collection team
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
which is Kaitlin's team and then there's
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
the sped bureau's team which does
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
different data collection that feeds
 
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
into the data warehouse so um what
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
you're asking I don't think um Caitlyn's
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
data team our our data team could do
 
01:28:17.229 --> 01:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
that right away but we certainly could
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
do that I just don't know um off the top
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
of my head I can't tell you if that
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
requires contract modifications or
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
anything else so you s oops so you're
 
01:28:26.590 --> 01:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
saying you can do it but it's just going
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
to take you time so can we pass this
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill as is or do you want it amended
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so the the reason for the amendment
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
is if you pass as is it's only going to
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
cost you $11 million extra but you'll be
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
you'll be Pro you'll be not getting what
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
we wanted well I I spoke with
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad the technical fix
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
here adding this little L any people
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
receiving special ed services will be
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
category a aligns close to what it was
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
intended for it to be um if you don't do
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
the sort of technical Amendment um there
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
could be students receiving sped
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
services that don't receive sped
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
differential Aid and therefore someone
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
could Challenge and say that's
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because the state
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
definition of adequacy says you shall
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
get sped Aid if you are receiving sped
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
Services um so that's kind of you have a
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of constitutional risk there
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
if you don't add the technical Amendment
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
um but then again the technical
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment costs you an extra 17.7
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
million the other way to get there would
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
be to do what you're describing is do a
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
second data collection that might cost
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
more than 17 million because then you'd
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
pick up more category B's and category
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
C's instead of defaulting to a um just a
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
different approach but if I may just ask
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
one final question um wouldn't the
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
information then be more
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
accurate uh yeah you would have more
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
detailed information thank
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair so I'm just
 
01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
trying to understand you I think you
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
said that it was not the intent of the
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill at all to exclude any children
 
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
from receiving this you know
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
differential Aid it just happened that
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
the way the language is defined it
 
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
requires them to be categorized and you
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the combined efforts of the school
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
districts and the doe will result in
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
some kids 46 31 you know 4631 not being
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
categorized in time and therefore not
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
eligible for the funding is that my
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
understanding my is my understanding
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so I can't speak I can't
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
speak to representative lad's intent but
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
I just I just I just I just walk this by
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
him through in the hallway and he said
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
this is what he wanted um so or he said
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is good I just want to state that
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
if that is the intent you know of the
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill and the wording is just a mistake
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
that produces a you know unre you know
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
an undesired result I have no problem
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
you know amending the bill to reflect
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
the correct policy meeting again right
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
but you know all I'm saying is again
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
there is no intent to change policy in
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
this case I think the policy is sound
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
right so if it's just a matter of fixing
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
language that does not match the what
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
the house thought they were voting on
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you Mr chair so the
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
these students uh would who are not
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
initially identified default to category
 
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
a I'm assuming if they're actually
 
01:31:09.390 --> 01:31:09.400 align:start position:0%
category C at some point in the year
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
they get mov to the appropr the next
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
payment the next year's payment they'll
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
get coded in so they would stay a for an
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
entire year and then the next year they
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
would move to yeah from October 2nd to
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year they' be in
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
that a bucket and then next year when
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
the data collection as long as they
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
stayed in their District public school
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
be so Mickey you you're absorbing all
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
this so oh uh I was going to say we can
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
have an amendment drafted it sounds like
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to have another work session
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
on house bu 1583 perhaps we also meet on
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
this one too with an amendments for me
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
and it'll give us and the department to
 
01:31:52.109 --> 01:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
just present something maybe update the
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to to a line or give you a
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
number true to the referenced amendment
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
that we draft as well for you to
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
consider okay
 
01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
yeah two questions first of all just
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
clarification is the the new cost 17.7
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
million or 17.7 million the increase
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
cost over above the 11 million oh no it'
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
be new cost so it be 11 million so as so
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the increase is 6.7
 
01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:22.280 align:start position:0%
million well so the increase to ensure
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
that all students would be a toal to Al
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
increase above what's current law is
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
17.7 million if we were to implement the
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
law as written it would be increase 11
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
million over current law yeah the
 
01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
technical Amendment cost 6.6 yeah okay
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so here's my question if
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not if I'm understanding correctly
 
01:32:43.629 --> 01:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
the base Bill let's call
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
it applies to roughly 31,000 St students
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh the base Bill actually since it was
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined to the data collection
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
methodologies of our sped Bureau it only
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
impacted 26,000 students not the full
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
Universal sped students okay okay fair
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
good thank you 26,000 students okay and
 
01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
the potential
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
modification is 4600 students uh correct
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
add to them too though yep okay so
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's about one the number of students
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
of the of the 26,000 roughly right uh
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
about a 20% increase yep so we got about
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
20% increase in students all of whom are
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
going into the least expensive bucket
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
but we get a 50 more than 50% increase
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
cost so I can actually well I have it
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
kind of broken out by uh table here with
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
all the calculations
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
so the Mark's doing on the fly as well
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
um so if we were to have category a
 
01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.950 align:start position:0%
um so if we were to have category a
which

01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.719 --> 01:33:59.709 align:start position:0%
 
be

01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of hard to describe
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
essentially but I can kind of show or we
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
can kind of exp explain yeah it's hard
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I mean that's a good
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
question we should look at the numbers
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
closely but um whether it's picking up a
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
lot of category B's or category C's um
 
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
so we could we could try to deal we
 
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
could bring something that dives deeper
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
into those numbers yeah confirm that
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so kind of just to briefly go
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
over the 11 million that covers all the
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
students identified by the 101
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
collection um the majority of it would
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
be category a those are that's the bulk
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
of it so when you apply the additional
 
01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know 4,000 students to the
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
category a it increases it by 12 uh the
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
total total sped Aid by 12 million so
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's proportionally it might just might
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
have to explain a little better I think
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
how it proportionately works out yeah I
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
think representative like just running
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
the numbers it's basically on average um
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
those 4600 students on average are
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
costing additional
 
01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
1,425 I'm just doing some quick math I
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
$1,425 so it appears those those more
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
transient population students happen to
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
be the higher category students because
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
they are above if they were all a then
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
it would be zero so it is moving it is
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
moving the number so it could be in the
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
data if we looked at the data it could
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
be those transient students are category
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
B and C that's kind of what you're
 
01:35:17.229 --> 01:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
pointing out it seems to be a little bit
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
outside of what Norm would expect you'd
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
expect closer to zero um but yeah we can
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
look into to see those students and see
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
if they are coded d and c um like you're
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
kind of pointing out with your
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
math yeah just to clarify cuz honestly
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
by this point in time I you know I think
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
I understand but I just want to double
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
check I'll
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
wait hang on I'm happy to wait for
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
Mickey no no by all means seriously I I
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
I mean it I'm happy to wait I um so
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
could you remind me which of the
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
categories is the you know larger
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
Financial impact and which is less so
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's the it's when you don't have
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
regular class when you spend uh the
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
least like in residential placement
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
spending not a lot of time in a regular
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
classroom so which of them is that a b
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
or c c so basically a would be your you
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
know lesser expense and then we go to
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
intermediate and then to high costs
 
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
right my understanding and again that's
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
what I would appreciate if you'd correct
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
if I misrepresent is that when we
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
originally had this bill this 11 million
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
in Impact
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
reflected an increase for certain
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
students and a decrease for others so
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
the net impact no no every everyone the
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
way represent Vlad designed it is
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
everyone's getting the same amount it's
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
just now we're paying extra for category
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
B and category C okay so there was no no
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
student for which a school would have
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
received less sped funds we just gave
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
them additional funds I think you just
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
figured out the math I think you now
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
you've you've knocked it out uh under
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the under the amended language we are
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
dropping 4,000 students so that's cost
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
there that's why that 1,000 number
 
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
showing up is because under the bill
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
with the technical error coming through
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
we're actually spending less money on
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
sped um but with the technical Amendment
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
we're bringing back up to kind of
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
current law and adding um additional So
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I think you've helped I
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it when when a clarification
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
question clarifies it's always a nice
 
01:37:17.790 --> 01:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
outcome thank you questions are good
 
01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
things I don't know what he just
 
01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:22.510 align:start position:0%
things I don't know what he just
[Laughter]

01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%

said

01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
B basically we have yeah we have um yeah
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't have to go into it it's all it's
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
all technical if you're saying yes
 
01:37:38.430 --> 01:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
yes we had
 
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
kids and we based this amount in
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
category a
 
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.430 align:start position:0%
category a
as

01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
being6 added on the base cost or of the
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
base cost excuse me of the base cost so
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
it came down what 2,000 some OD dollars
 
01:38:08.350 --> 01:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit higher than what
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're paying right now for special Alit
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
the second category
 
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
B was 1.2 times the base
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
cost and then category C which is all
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
those residential placement kids
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and those which are home
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
homeschool Homebound and might be in the
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals that was 1.8 times that base
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
the base that was used was the base that
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
we uh costed out as the the cost of the
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
a the low average
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
$444 not on base the base cost now so
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
doing that calculation for all the
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
students in these various categories we
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
came up that maybe we have bad math in
 
01:38:59.470 --> 01:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
policy of $35 million total on top of
 
01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.430 align:start position:0%
policy of $35 million total on top of
the

01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
66 or 34 million somewhere around that
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I don't have any of that
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
paperwork in front of me now yeah and so
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not figuring how it's being
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
calculated because just increasing by $
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
11 million it's it's
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's as you intended it represent lad it
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
should have been closed 17 and I don't
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
know what factors you Ed in your ma
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
whether you included swep whether you
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
included the whole harmless so I don't
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
know if you back some of it's going to
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
eat away at the whole Harless we we
 
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
simply took the base cost the a
 
01:39:34.669 --> 01:39:34.679 align:start position:0%
projected base cost of
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
4,44 and then and then multiplied for
 
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
that first a category times the 6 that's
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
what we used to
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
$2,642 per kit then the next category B
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
we took the 1.2 multiplied that times
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
the 44 and it came down $5,280
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
and and then the next category C 1.8
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
times would be
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
$7,923 multiplying those categories by
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
the number of kids in those categories I
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
understand the October one deadline is
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
is giving a concern I get that but in
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
category a there's 24,1 153 kids
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
multiply that times
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
2,642 you get a numbers the same thing
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the B and adding those up it it came
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
$35,000 $ 35,1
 
01:40:33.229 --> 01:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
122643 6
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
$643 I I'm just not following along with
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
what's being said here yeah represent
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
your calculation doesn't include eating
 
01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
swep though but this one's not this is
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
you pure left of
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
right the the way this bill was written
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
it was it was written so that we would
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
start this whole thing with this
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
weighted formula based upon that 4404
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
figure not what's going on in any other
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
component that's where we wanted to
 
01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:13.910 align:start position:0%
component that's where we wanted to
start

01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this may in the upper
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
end eliminate a little bit of what we
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
have to cost out in CAD a and and and
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
and and because we're multiplying times
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
a different number three and a half
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
times the 10 times yeah I may if I may
 
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
have a question and the comment um if I
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
may start with a question could you just
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
confirm what we were talking about
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
earlier that there was never an intent
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill to you know Miss the 46 31
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
kids and the original intent was to make
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
sure that every kid got at least
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
category a
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
funding as I mentioned when I testified
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
initially here in the committee was that
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's several ways in which we're
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
getting these numbers if you were
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
talking to director foret the number
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
would be closer to 28,000 kids because
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
she does a one-time shot look at and the
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
guys that are budget guys behind me do
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
it differently and so they come up with
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
the 31,000 kids and so so we're going
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
along with the budget guys okay so then
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
it would be a yes-ish to my question per
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
me would the answer be a yes no I I I I
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
think I hear a yes but I just want to
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that the intent was to include
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
this 4631 that we are looking to include
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
with this amendment yeah just checking
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that I will say and
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
that was the comment part is
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
that as we all know in this room the
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
frequent people in this room the
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
education formula is a complicated beast
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
and every time you touch it in one place
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
something happens in another and I would
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that at this time trying to do a
 
01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
full impact on what happen happens on
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
the right side is probably more than we
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
can handle for the next year there is a
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
budget process next year and I'm sure
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
we'll play a lot with it so I I would
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
suggest that for now I just want to get
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know this done in time and you know
 
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
keep it reasonably simple and you know
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
come back to it in one year and I'm sure
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have at it you know that that's
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
just so much when you start looking at
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
everything and I think the policy
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
already you know pretty much said that
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
what happens on on the right side is
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
approved by the house whether they
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
thought about it or not representative
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
the the I I understand what you're
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
saying there's there's two things which
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
we have to look at and remember that we
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
are trying to support and differentiated
 
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
Aid right now all IEPs equally we know
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
that is not the way it works for those
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
13 IEPs we have some students that are
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injured that are mute
 
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
which are blind which are orthopedically
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
handicapped go down that list others
 
01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
maybe get in just you know two hour an
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
hour two different times a week on
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
speech and oftentimes that may be a Dev
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
developmentally delay which is you know
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
questionable in itself so but the other
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
component of this is that we need to get
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
weighted into our formula uh and
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
recognize that that's an important
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
component figures can change yes but
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
this concept needs to be placed in there
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we need to look at that secondly
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the largest complaint we get from
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
school districts is that when one of
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
these students moves into their District
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
the real costly student when they have a
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
a great education program in the school
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
and with all the services it becomes a
 
01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:50.390 align:start position:0%
and with all the services it becomes a
magnet

01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
magnet
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
school and that by that you have folks
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
around saying I want my kid going there
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
to get that special education service so
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
there there there it be that these are
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
the questions that now I was called into
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office summer before last
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
he had a board member sitting right
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
there with them say how are we going to
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
address this $1.5 million figure we have
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
for special what which we don't have the
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
money for and we had some of these kids
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
move into town on us so special EDS a
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
serious issue it's got to addressed and
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
whether you fund it the way we had you
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
know put forward which is important we
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
need to get weighted amounts in this we
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
have tried now several years running to
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
do this and there are very few states
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
that don't do this right now they they
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
do the weighted I think we're all on
 
01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.510 align:start position:0%
do the weighted I think we're all on
board

01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think that's a
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
problem the numbers I know it's it's
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
numbers with you guys could I just ask a
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
question about the cat a pie in the
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
category C sure so Rick you and I have
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
had a conversation a million times about
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
the those kiddos who are the most severe
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
and Cat Aid has a well it's not cat Aid
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
any special at Aid has a Year's drag on
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
it so if I'm a school district and I
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
have a child who moves in and it's
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
expense is going to be $300,000 I don't
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
get repaid till the following year um is
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
it your hope that this category C will
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
to some extent remediate that it's going
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
to it's going to address it to a degree
 
01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:30.229 align:start position:0%
to it's going to address it to a degree
but

01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
for you know how that formula works you
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
guys have talked about this many times
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
the first three and a half times the
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
average cost $20,000 per kid that's
 
01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
$70,000 that district has to put up
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
first you might subtract out of that
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
$2,100 or $2,300 for a differentiated
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
Aid so the bulk of that 70 grand they to
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
cough up from three and a half times to
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
10 times that you have the the state
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
will put up 80% they have to come up
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
with the other
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
20% yes and and then then you have that
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
total amount 10 over 10 times but
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we have more kids showing up
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
category and so it's pro rated down and
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
we have pro rated it down some years
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
almost close to
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
70% uh of what they should be receiving
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
now we in last several years we've tried
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
to do it at 100% we have couple we're
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
slipping back down around
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
89% so it it's it's a dreadful situation
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
we got to help all this is not a donor
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
versus non-donor right th this is a
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
issue for
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah yeah
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
so I thought I heard we needed to do an
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah I was just going to ask
 
01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair do you think we could draw an
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that would add the language
 
01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
that the department just talked about to
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
try to catch those 4,000 some odd kids
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
that were not accounted for on October
 
01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.629 align:start position:0%
that were not accounted for on October
1st

01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
1st
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
amendment we we can draft that and I
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
think one other thing to clarify too is
 
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
when was this intended to be effective
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
so subparagraph 1 D1 seems to apply in
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20 uh five and sub paragraph 3
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
talks about in two in July 21st or
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me July 1st 2025 in year
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
thereafter so I just want to clarify
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
when would be year one of this
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
change that's ay
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
question well policy already put it to
 
01:48:41.870 --> 01:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
you we wanted the first year well the
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
school budget is going to be being
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
voted just got
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
voted and
 
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
so if we make this effective
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
anytime before March of next
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
year then it'll be effective March of
 
01:49:02.189 --> 01:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
locally so what what date the July
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
one if if the change was to be July 1
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
the year beginning July 1 2025 now
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
you're into the next banial cycle for
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
the budget to uh so it would it would
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
align um because this talks about uh you
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
know I I don't know represent lad if
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
your intention was it to be during this
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
the the budget that's already enacted or
 
01:49:29.470 --> 01:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
for the next budget that's kind of where
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict between these two
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
paragraphs so e either way we can draft
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
in an amendment uh what was your
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
intention get it done as soon as
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
possible okay I'll go with that
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
everybody comfortable with that yeah I
 
01:49:44.199 --> 01:49:48.109 align:start position:0%
everybody comfortable with that yeah I
Y

01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
money so what what
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
date 60 days
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
after signing or what I don't have I
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
think we would make it eff of July 1
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
2024 okay yeah so we can yes I I'll work
 
01:50:07.709 --> 01:50:07.719 align:start position:0%
with the Department to not only
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate their corrective language
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
here but also just make sure the timing
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
works with the intent of of what
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative lad is looking to do and
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
we can have an amendment for the next
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
work session okay try to get it to
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
everyone ahead of time to review all
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
right thank you we thank you for your
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
support m yes can I just add one one
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
thing so I I support what representative
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
lad's talking about but also remember we
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
were all on the special committee to
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
study uh for school funding and it was
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
really that committee's intent intent um
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
for um for these Provisions particularly
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
the two Provisions in 1583 and the one
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
provision in um one we're talking about
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
16 to um to take effect um um 7124 four
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
another provision in 1583 adjusting the
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
base from 4100 to 4400 would take effect
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
7125 but the committee's intention was
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
also to uh to make to look at I I think
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
without the committee did
 
01:51:15.069 --> 01:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
not have the luxury at looking at policy
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
language we were looking at um cost um
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
um cost ball parks at that point and
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
remember we were doing some negotiating
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
and give take on that and what we had
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
decided was 1656 would create three
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
categories an increase of 35 million
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
over current law effective 71 2024 so 35
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
million is what represented Vlad was
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
talking about very different than what
 
01:51:43.950 --> 01:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
were you know the the finances that we
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
saw today and then I believe 1583 as
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
voted by the house um talked about
 
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity it Grant 39 million over
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
current law the um what did we call it
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
the enhanced free and reduced lunch
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
Grant 25 million over current law both
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
effective 7124 and then the increase of
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
the base from 4182 to 444 for a cost
 
01:52:13.229 --> 01:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
increase of $35 million effective
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
71225 and my understanding is that's
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
what the the special subcommittee uh
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
approved and I'm hoping that
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
1656 it's going to be the amendment to
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
1656 is going to be drafted so that it
 
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
follows that $35 million increase as
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
intended by the subcommittee over
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
current law whether that means that
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to eat into hold
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
harmless but but as representative lad
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
said this is something that impacts
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
every District across the state because
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
every district has um struggling with
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
special education we all agree with you
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so I just want to make sure that
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're heing to the intent of yes
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
of that special thank thank you very
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
much for listening okay I guess we're
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
done for today we'll have this party
 
01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:21.430 align:start position:0%
done for today we'll have this party
again

01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
sometime
