um so I sent out an email which was uh
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
in the form that I would
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
have sent to uh the partial draft
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment for House Bill 1271 thank you
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
um which I think took in all of the
 
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
changes that we had uh discussed and
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know uh repr G if you had
 
00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at on the second page
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the email the part dealing with the
 
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:18.879 align:start position:0%
membership of Guardian at Liam I tried
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
to reflect what I understood of what you
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
wanted actually mostly copied it so does
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
that look okay it looked good I I think
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
Doug was going to look at Lang anguage
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
for that lawyer
 
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
um a guardian at lium who was a member
 
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
of the bar is the way I put it but there
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
might be better language than that yeah
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
if you could come up
 
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh and I didn't send this out to a lot
 
00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
of people I sent it to the people on the
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but I probably should have
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
sent it to you but the current the the
 
00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:54.759 align:start position:0%
the proposed language and this is um
 
00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
would you like me to give them my copy
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
that I had mailed out this is youa yeah
 
00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
great so it's um the top of the third
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
page of
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
that where goes one member who is a bar
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
member and who page two three yeah page
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
oh you I gave him so top of the back
 
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
page is where he's at is this the same
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
as the oh you just you just removed the
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't give them the front Okay cool
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
right I don't know where it is on that
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
copy but it's um the section that that
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:20.069 align:start position:0%
 
490-2186

00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
and I think the other language is pretty
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
much um
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
statute was some removals yes I just
 
00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:35.959 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back to I brought this up
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
at the full um board too yesterday full
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
committee too um I I do have a is
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
concern with putting executive director
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
I know we moved it from board to if we
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
can keep the office as a consistency is
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
what in other places I actually um if
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
you look at the the amendment I sent
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um it changed it to executive
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
director everywhere because that's
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
what's in the rest of Statute and and if
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
you have a you can't you can't assign a
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility to an office you have to
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
assign it to a person and she is the
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
director of the office so really it in
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
effect it has to be the same that
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean she's going to do
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
everything she'll she has staff all that
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
but but the language that's in the rest
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the statute is um the executive
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
director so the existing statute has
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
executive director correct and I think
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a drafting error that they
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
they like over half they put executive
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
director in some places they did
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
office and I went through it because if
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
you look at bracket board bracket where
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
they're replacing there's like 145
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
occurrences in here correct and I went
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
through them mall and what I'm telling o
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
op OS is that anyone Works bracket board
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
bracket office to change it to executive
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
director to be consistent with the other
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
statute so but in the Statue existing
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
statue has board correct so because
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we are trying to change to
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
make it advisory but in the existing
 
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
statute elsewhere where there are there
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
are existing advisory boards so for the
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
other advisory boards the language and
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
statute is executive director not
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
office now does executive board no I
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
mean Advisory Board and Ru making
 
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
statutory board or licensing board that
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
had the ability to license that was
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
moved last year and that is the concern
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
where the statue uh if there is a
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
conflict that still has the board
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory board versus right OPC
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
getting that is that I I'm that's where
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
my confusion is so in existing statute
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
where there are where some of the boards
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
are advisory boards
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
today then the language doesn't have
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
board in there it has executive director
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
office okay so if we're going to change
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
some these to Advisory Board then what
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
we need to do is change board to
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
executive director some places in the
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
this bill it has it but other places in
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
the bill it's replacing board with
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
office and that's not correct okay so
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
you clarified one doubt that is only if
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the statutary board is becoming ex um ad
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board then the executive
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
director needs to be in place of the
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
board correct if it still stays as a
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
statutory board not all 57 boards are
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
converting that into Advisory Board am I
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
correct so if it is a statutary board
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
then we don't need to do the executive
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
director we're not dealing with all the
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
boards we're only dealing with the ones
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill deals with right now so
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah which is advisory trying change we
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to try and change the
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine to an Advisory board
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
or anything so that yeah but it has on
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
a we can turn the mic on and introduce
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
yourself I guess I have one
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation for Section D and I'm
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
putting something together for Section d
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
section D okay minor change won't change
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the meeting just uh okay yeah if you
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
could uh email that to me and then I'll
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
update this I have just hand it back to
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
oh you have the language yeah I just did
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
it right now okay yeah if you can get
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
that to us

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
level the bar is T is bar and okay no
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
change Mr chair if I can just um make a
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
comment to Doug he's working on the
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
language for the the line we had that
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
was one member of the Child Protection
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
Agency uh member and I was trying to
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
find what in statute so I I tried to
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
look at our any of those other I was
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
confused at the last meeting when I said
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals Easter Seals was a child
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
placement agency at one point which I
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
don't think they still are that's
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
different than a Child Protection Agency
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't know what language to
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
use that would Encompass both DCF and
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
other things like KY program and in
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
looking around at various the Child
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
Protection Systems seem to be a term but
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
legally I don't know that's your yeah I
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
right I'm trying to think of a word
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
because agency to me makes me think more
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
official like a state agency uh system
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure is the right word so I'm
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
just trying to find one word to plug in
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
organization how about Child Protection
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
Organization which could be a state
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
organiz state agency or a private KC
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
Foundation is a private nonprofit but
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's an organization that would I think
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
that would do it that would cover yeah
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals cac's yeah I think that
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
organization would be a good yeah Easter
 
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
Seals is not a protection agency it's
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
more a placement and provider of
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
programs for right so casy Foundation is
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
similar to dcyf a private
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
representing

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's okay all right so
 
00:16:58.749 --> 00:16:58.759 align:start position:0%
um with the the changes that were in
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
that email I sent and the two changes we
 
00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:02.710 align:start position:0%
that email I sent and the two changes we
just

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.429 align:start position:0%
just
discussed

00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
um I'd like a motion on
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
adopting the guardian and Lim section so
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
this is um you
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
know can I raise one more issue before
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
you move on not to slow things down
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
there's a repeal the 490 C4 is Page and
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
page and line looking for right 12 page
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
12 12 12 line 28 is a repeal and replace
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's the duties of the board uh I just
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to draw your attention to section
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
g and I want to make sure everybody's
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
read that language
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
before we repeal it entirely we P page
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
in line again yeah so it's not in the
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill because it's repealed that's why I
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
want to draw your atten it's dropping
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
something it's a line across cross it's
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
a complete real repealing and replace
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
because the language of the bill is
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
repealed and reenacted as then you don't
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
get any line acrosses and it's just and
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
what does it do so it's um it allows the
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
board which will change to the executive
 
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.070 align:start position:0%
board which will change to the executive
director

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
to at their discretion um what do they
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
do refer a complaint to the appropriate
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
court for investigation resolution or
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
other action uh it's a May the referral
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
may be made regardless of whether the
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
allegation or complaint relates to a
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
case which is then pending in court uh
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
may be made in Li of or in addition to
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
any investigatory or disciplinary
 
00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
procedures that the board May itself be
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
authorized to
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
pursue uh gives the board authority to
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
formally resolve complaints by agreement
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
which we don't really need because of
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
310 but then the last sentence is the
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
one I believe the executive director dor
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
testified on a complaint relating to a
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
trial or judicial proceeding in progress
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
shall be dismissed without prece unless
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
the board for good cause votes to
 
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.909 align:start position:0%
the board for good cause votes to
proceed

00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
immediately so before before you moved
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
on I just wanted to make sure you had
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
eyes on that language um that's that's P
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
policy dut as I understand it and I
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have printed
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody but unless you can
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
look it up on your phone I pass it
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
surrounded if you can tell us where to
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
look up I can look up on sure it's for
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
490-cfm

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
so Doug as I understand it these are
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
duties the board head and when we
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
repealed the board language to make it
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
advisory in another bill that is being
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
looked up we now have these duties
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
dangling no no this I this one is just
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
everything else I did like a comparison
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
everything else in this Duty section is
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
is in this language that we're seeing
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
except this section and our big concern
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
is that it was being interpreted and
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
rightly so I think that the office
 
00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:23.799 align:start position:0%
didn't have the ability to follow
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
through on complaints because of just
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
the way the language is worded but
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more to it to that
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
it seems to have this kind of Dual
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
Purpose where you can have the board
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
investigating a complaint and also the
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
office I think our concern was with the
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
very last sentence AR say which one
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
again I'm uh 490 C4 G one uh Roman one
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
Roman G all of all of the citation would
 
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.230 align:start position:0%
Roman G all of all of the citation would
be

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
helpful so I think our concern was with
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
the last sentence a complaint relating
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
to a trial or judicial proceedings in
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
progress shall be dismissed without
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
prejudice unless the board for good
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
cause um that was our big concern now
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
would you still leave at the board well
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
I actually drafted a proposed
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
amendment if you decide to keep this
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph in I think what's the argument
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
for keeping it in Lindsay has a I don't
 
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.549 align:start position:0%
for keeping it in Lindsay has a I don't
think

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
there I don't know I don't know that I
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
think Lindsay has a concern that that
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
this seems to
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
be the court interjecting itself in sort
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
of Family Matters in a inappropriate way
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
when the board could probably resolve
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
the issue on its
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
own so so but but I also think that's a
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
policy decision but just so I understand
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
I mean if this becomes an Advisory board
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
so the board would still be looking at
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
individual it okay uh represent so I
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
think the the policy question is whether
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
or not you want to give us the authority
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
to refer the matter to the court for a
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
separate investigation and that's really
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
the question if you don't then I don't
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
think we need to change anything in 1271
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
if you think that we should be able to
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
make that recommendation we may want to
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
add either that language back in or and
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
then I have I also have a proposed
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendment because of that last sentence
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
it says a complaint relating to a trial
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
or judicial proceeding in progress shall
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
be dismissed without Prejudice I drafted
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
language which I guess is a third option
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
where you could add just this language
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
in and it would allow us to stay a
 
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.669 align:start position:0%
in and it would allow us to stay a
complaint

00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:40.230 align:start position:0%
complaint
pending

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
pending
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
the conclusion of the proceeding in
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
court so we could sit on a complaint
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
without the statute of limitations
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
tolling but they you're passing it off
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the court yeah I have a draft if you
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
just excuse me I
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
minute all right I was just going to ask
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
if you would translate that last
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
me so so we have a stat if a complaint
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
comes in we have a statute of
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
limitations yeah and looks like one of
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
the concerns is the complaint process
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
being weaponized so parents could file a
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
complaint against the guardian ad item
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
if we take this section out where under
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
the regular uh fiveyear statute of
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
limitations okay what this would do the
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
language I just proposed would allow us
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
to stay that procedure so we can just
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
sit on it and when the court stuff is
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
done then we can go and do our complaint
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
investigation and we're not losing that
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
time in between thank you yep represent
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
M py yeah
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
um So currently the complaint is when it
 
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.190 align:start position:0%
um So currently the complaint is when it
comes

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
comes
 
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.710 align:start position:0%
comes
from

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh what is it at Liam right or when the
 
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
complaint comes from parents or
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
non-parent general public where does
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
that get handled well in the current law
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
it says it shall be dismissed without
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
prejudice so the complaint complainant
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
could complain again afterwards after
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
the proceeding is over unless the board
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
for good cause votes to proceed
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
immediately so right now unless there's
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
good cause the complaints just dismissed
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the complainant would have to bring
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
it before the board again when the court
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
stuff is
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
over so follow up so the board hears the
 
00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
complaint at this
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
time board has
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of responding to
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
complaints at this
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
time the step I'm trying to understand
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
the statue as it is board has the
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
authority to look at and inform
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
oplc whether to move forward or not
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way it used to work I would
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
say under the current procedure because
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
the office has the complaint
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
investigation we would have to present
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
it to the board and then they would make
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
the decision favoring dismissal without
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
prejudice right
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
now so I suppose we could still do our
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
investigation and then bring it to
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
them but I also one of the concerns too
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
is that that board doesn't meet all that
 
00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:55.710 align:start position:0%
is that that board doesn't meet all that
often

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is is is there
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
what's the problem with um instead of
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
holding on to the I if I understand
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
correctly the options are you hold on to
 
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.310 align:start position:0%
correctly the options are you hold on to
the

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
complaint um
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
and pending the the court thing being
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
um if basically the office decides the
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
office could proceed with the complaint
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
right away but if they think they need
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
the the results from the court this
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
would let them wait and deal with the
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
complaint after the alternative would be
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know whe the board
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
could not act on the complaint if they
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
think they need to wait for the judicial
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
thing and then say bring the complaint
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
after it's all done or or what are the
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
Alternatives right now it says that it
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
shall be dismissed so I think they're
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to get rid of that complaint I
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
guess they could sit on it but then you
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
also have the problem of the statute of
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
limitations is taking away and the
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
courts can take a long time right um so
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
but if they say if they dismiss it can
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
that complaint be brought again later
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
yes but it would make somebody file
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
another complaint okay all right so so
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that the thought
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
process is that the timing right so you
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
have a statue of uh limitation for five
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
years so if somebody brought a complaint
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and it was dismissed they have you know
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
and it comes up again within the five
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
years will that it has to be a separate
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
file separ complaint okay so this
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
response to my focus is on timing for
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
complaints you know who's do checks and
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
balances if it comes from parent it
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
comes from DCF it comes from any place
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
responded that it that has to be we're
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to treat every complaint the same
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
regardless of the source okay yeah so i'
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion which is um oh
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
exective director oh um yeah on your uh
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
suggested uh change
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
here we're on you have um unless the
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
office decides to proceed immediately
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
would that be the executive director or
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
office which is executive director okay
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for good catch that
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be a problem go home
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
now all right so uh what the motion I'm
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
making is is that is to adopt
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
um this proposed amendment to
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
add I guess add back in or add um 490
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
c4e with the change we just talked about
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
of changing office to executive director
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
um for clarification Mr chair so the
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not solely on executive director
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
respons does not fall on correct okay
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that represent Brown so uh
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about this a number
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair a number of times any
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
anytime in any statute that it says the
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner the executive director or
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
anything of that nature it always gives
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
them the responsibility but it means it
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
gets passed down through the staff as
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
that person may want to to pass that
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
down so whenever it says that in any
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
statute it never means that the
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner has all those tasks himself
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
for the executive director that's that's
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
how it just is is normally worded I
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
understand there are two different
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
Capital questions uh you know executive
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
director as cap capitalized and then
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
small case so it's individual that's my
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
understanding when director Courtney
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
said it has to be a person and that has
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
to be the executive director so that's
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
where I have the buck stops at the dor
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility but to make
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
sure it gets done but they don't have to
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
do the work necessarily right okay um so
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
we have a motion and a second
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
um unless we need further discussion can
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
we move to a vote on this okay everyone
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
who approves adopting this change um say
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
I anyone opposed anyone opposed okay all

stuff

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
commission where's the stuff we were
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
just dealing with uh well the changes to
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
the membership right here top right we
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
already dealt with separately but this
 
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
last it was C C2 where
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
C2 unless I've got the wrong
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
no it's C4 repealed and
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
reenacted L 26 and 27 and then
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
DNA okay it's really um
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:01.750 align:start position:0%
DNA okay it's really um
sorry

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
F

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay actually there was a change to the
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
language I
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
propose Mr chair yes I had one question
 
00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
about the Advisory Board versus uh
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
statut is it a in general or a
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
particular page in the line to look the
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
ones that are listed here right all
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
eight of them that are converting yeah
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
and uh so what is one of the concerns is
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
having done a little bit more re
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
research on it um is if it is an
 
00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
research on it um is if it is an
Advisory

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
Advisory
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
board and the licy or the certificate
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
holder should use I mean have more
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
malpractice or
 
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.909 align:start position:0%
malpractice or
um

00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
um insurance I don't immunity uh
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
liability immunity for the members of
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
the board not the members of the board
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
if that is taken away from the members
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want a clarification will it
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
rest on the license the question is does
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
it make any change to the lenses yes I I
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
can't see it but I don't I don't think
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I mean as far as the board members
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
there they have some protections and
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
other stat
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
statutes but it I don't think I'm
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
understanding when the lies either have
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
a license or they don't and it's not
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
affected whether it's an advisory or
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
Stat correct that's correct no but so
 
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:08.510 align:start position:0%
Stat correct that's correct no but so
the

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
liability won't shift the liability when
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
we talked about liability it's nothing
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
to do with the lenses at all okay the
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
liabilities was with the board
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
members correct correct there's no
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
change to the lenes correct so the board
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
members if you statutary board they have
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
Pro liability protection because they're
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
nominated from the state is that
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
liability protection is still available
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
for an Advisory Board member I think
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's even better for the advisory it's
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
even better for The Advisory board right
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
didn't we have that conversation about
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
the con case or somewhere there was a
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
case yeah you're right because they're
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
not making the final decision
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
anymore um they are actually Less open
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
to liability issues if we make an
 
00:34:56.879 --> 00:34:57.910 align:start position:0%
to liability issues if we make an
Advisory

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
Advisory
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
board so the state is taking up
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
the resp responsibility for I mean the
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
antitrust issue is if you have somebody
 
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
a market participant so somebody who
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
works in that field making the decisions
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't work in the field so
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's not a concern for the State uh
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know anti trust concern there might
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
be others but and you tell me if I'm
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
wrong but one more comment sounds good
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
represent Brown if I might thank you Mr
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
chair I we briefly touched on this and I
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
know in the in the original it's it's an
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
or as well but are we all okay with the
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
fact that DCF could possibly not be on
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
this Advisory Board the way it's written
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
the way it has been written that way too
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
but you said it generally has been them
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
but I just are we all good with that I
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
guess is I I think actually there's not
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
an or in the final the thing I emailed
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
out unless I'm looking at the a
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
different part that you're talking about
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
says that section is one member
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
represent presenting a Child Protection
 
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
Organization in the state appointed by
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
the executive director right so it might
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
not be DCF as my point it could include
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
DCF or the private organization which is
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
how it's written now I I'm just saying
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
for the sake of conversation are we all
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay with that that might be the
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
case not that's the situation today is
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
the situation now okay yeah so I am
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable if you're asking personally
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
I am comfortable as long as DCF or a
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
Protection Organization which is
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
involved is represented on the board I'm
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
fine okay so I'm going to make thank you
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to make another uh
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
motion which is to if you look at the
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
email I sent uh draft partial
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment and this is about the last
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
major bullet which says replace section
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
22 page 11 line 35 through page 12 line
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
25 and that's around the guardian and
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
Lim part of membership board membership
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
so the question is are people okay are
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is to adopt that with the
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
changes we've made today which are to
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
part one C changing it it's it's more
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
you know changing it from system to to
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
organization take the the out and then
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
on uh D updating the language to make it
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
clear that they they have to be a member
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
of of the New Hampshire Bar Association
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a technical thing
 
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.270 align:start position:0%
um and
[Music]

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
then then also adding back in what's
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to become 490c for E I guess is
 
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
going to become 490c for E I guess is
now

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
G um with the and the basically the
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
thing we just adopted
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay um so I'm the E is staying right
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
one member yeah why did you say it's now
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
G um no now e it used to be G I think no
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
or okay never mind there's no G never
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
adopt

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
I just out of curiosity will the
 
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
members on uh the board get a mileage or
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
I I know without comp it's really not
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
pertinent to this we need to move on I
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
apologize but this has taken a lot
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
longer than I'd hop for good reason
 
00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:24.270 align:start position:0%
longer than I'd hop for good reason

wasn't clear we cut it from seven to
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
five right instead instead of going to
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
three it's to five okay because we haded

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
26 through well through 36
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
and then page
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
21 um lines one
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
through 10 okay all right thank
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
you right in particular if I may y
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're going from a uh
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
a nine member board to an advisory three
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
member board um you know including
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
installer of the home structural
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
engineer dealer retailer um all being
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
appointed by the executive director
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
which was formerly um the New Hampshire
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association would
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
nominate people to this board certainly
 
00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
because we have a better handle quite
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
frankly on members of our industry okay
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
um now it would be the executive
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
director and I guess we're trying to
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
find out what would be the criteria for
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the executive director to choose and
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
nominate I'd like to do is first deal
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
with who the members are and deal with
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
how they're picked second because I may
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
have them come up and speak on it on
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
their take on it so um I know the
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
membership's going from 9 to
 
00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:34.630 align:start position:0%
membership's going from 9 to
3

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
3
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and they're and that's generally
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
being done with
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh when they're moved to Advisory board
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
but as in the previous one we we we
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it down to brought it to
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
five instead so I mean if there's ones
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
you think are critical to be put back in
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.829 align:start position:0%
 
know

00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
represent Brown yes thank you Mr chair I
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
think in any case a board of three I
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
know there must be some reason somewhere
 
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
that someone decided to go to this
 
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
that someone decided to go to this
number

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
but Boards of three um I think can be
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
complicated it takes one person being
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
out to make it to to being absent to
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
making it really complicated but seems
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
like five is a better number but it must
 
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
have been a reason someone went to three
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that was but the the
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
info we heard from uh the Governor's
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative was that
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's I don't know about
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
in this case but in general there have
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
been problems uh um the appointment
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
process is very timeconsuming and
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
complicated and in some cases they had
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
trouble finding people and and I think
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
they went and did this through all the
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
boards and it it some boards it is an
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
issue other boards it may not which is
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
why we're looking at the membership on
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
each of
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
these so they kind of did US spread did
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
it all the same representative mpy thank
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
you um is there an issue with the Quorum
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
and how often the board meets currently
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
that was one of the issues that was
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
addressed um the the board only meets as
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
necessary um so it's it's typically not
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
an issue we have had some issues with
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum but uh some of that I
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
think has more to do with the fact that
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's nine people right now I think as
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative said if we move down to
 
00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
five I think that would be a much better
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
number and then I don't think uh getting
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
a quorum for any of the meetings would
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
be an issue okay so if we were to add
 
00:44:31.549 --> 00:44:31.559 align:start position:0%
two additional
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
people on uh you know which which ones
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
suggest I don't have a problem doing
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair represent one more
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
question in terms of how many times did
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh the board meet in 2023 why don't we
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
get that from oplc and I'd like to get
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
an answer to this question and then
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
we'll move on if we can do that on who
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
we should add yeah um I mean in my
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
personal opinion I would probably say a
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
code official would probably be somebody
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
that would be good for that and then um
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
an owner or operator of
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
a a community it doesn't need to be I
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to set a each
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
different size
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
but one owner operator one it's it's
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
sort of the same one in the
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
same okay all right thank you um is
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
there anything else you want to say
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
about other parts of this and then we'll
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
move on to deal with uh how the me board
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
membership selected yeah with the the
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
term limits all right um on that I speak
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
to that it's currently I think the the
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
board if you were to switch to this
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
everybody on the board except for maybe
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
two people wouldn't even qualify the
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
board and this board has been in
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
existence since around I think 2005 2006
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
and many of those people on the board
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
have been on the board this entire time
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to keep those
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
people on the board or let them serve
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
for as long as they want because of the
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge base they have with creating
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
this installation standards to begin
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
with um there also aren't that many
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
lenses in the state and I actually think
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
finding people if you start setting term
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
limits and people can't be on the board
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
anymore finding people that want to
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
serve on the board could be found to be
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
very difficult okay um so you excuse me
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
which page in line are we on with turn
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
he's on page 21 lines 9 through 10 nine
 
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:42.030 align:start position:0%
he's on page 21 lines 9 through 10 nine
and

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.109 align:start position:0%
and
10

00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I can see that
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
for um you know the people that work in
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
at the field so certainly the install
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
doer and maybe the dealer
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
retailer but is there a shortage of
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
um structural architect or engineer
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
maybe that is and then since we're
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of uh owner
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
operators I mean are there enough of
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
them that those that position could be
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh limited to how long they could be on
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
or you know would that be okay is there
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
an argument against
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
it yeah I mean I could definitely see
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
that those issues arising I mean it's
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
manufactur housing installation is kind
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
of a niche to begin with there aren't a
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
whole lot of people that just handle
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
this area so it's and it's not I
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it a growing area either
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's would probably be going I would say
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's going the opposite direction with
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
the people that are involved interrup I
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
think I understand the reason for the
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
installer and and the dealer or retailer
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
having a limited number of those and so
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
maybe not limiting how long they can
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
serve but are there the same concerns
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
for the structural engineer and the
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
owner operator
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
members I'm not sure we could comment
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
about the structural engineer okay and
 
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.270 align:start position:0%
about the structural engineer okay and
owner

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
owner
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
operators I would say the same concern
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
um as co-ops become a bigger thing and
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
more communities go
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
louder near the mic as owner operators
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
and co-ops become more prevalent in the
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
state you're for losing the the owner
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
operator side of it so there are
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
becoming less and less of those as well
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
right right now there's I guess four
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
owner operators total on the board it
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
looks like two of
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
the small one of the yeah two of the
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
small one of
 
00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.150 align:start position:0%
small one of
the

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
um one of 100 more and one one of 100
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
and less that's
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
two and uh okay no that's it there's
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's three right now yes so
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
is no that's somebody that's a co-op
 
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's a co-op sorry right right so um I
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
guess the what I'm getting that is has
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
there been a problem finding those
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
people who are owner operators of parks
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
today and you're saying there may be
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
fewer available I don't I can't it's
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
tough to speak that just because our
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
board has mostly been made up of people
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
that have stayed on the board for such a
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
long period of time that it been very
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
infrequent where we've need to needed to
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
actually find somebody new to to uh to
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
serve on the board okay so separate from
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
the membership oh representative Brown
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah just thank you Mr chair backing up
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
a little maybe oplc can answer this and
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you can I was going to have them
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
up shortly
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
why I'm not seeing consistency in all
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
these rules we're looking at on term
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
limits seems like some of them don't
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
have any term limits and some of them
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
do yeah thank you um so any comments on
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
anything other than board membership and
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
the expiration
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have op PLC up
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
to no uh representative G thank you Mr
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
question so we're removing for uh
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
whatever a a bunch of owner operators
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
one of which is a Cooperative one I'm
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
assuming the language we replace this
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
with given your comment uh that that the
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
field if you call it I don't know what
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
you call it is moving the business is
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
moving toward a cooperative model that
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
you would want it to be either or that
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
the language be open enough that that
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
one member could be from a Cooperative
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
model or it could be from a owner
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
operator model that's actually a good
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
point if I may yeah
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
um there is no it's my understanding uh
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
that under the current uh board that
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
requires a Cooperative member um that
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
has been vacant they have not been able
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
to fill it
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
out but for future use if we leave the
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
language open and it can be either or
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
does that give the board more
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility as we move ahead it'd be the
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
appointment person F right the board
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
composition yeah I mean if it has a
 
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.870 align:start position:0%
composition yeah I mean if it has a
Cooperative

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
Cooperative
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
now you can't really speak against it
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you I think I would definitely
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
want an owner operator on there then as
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
well certainly for the five right if we
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
well and we already talked about you
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
wanted a municipal Cod enforcement
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
officer we need an odd number so yeah um
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
okay let's Mr chair oh one more question
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
for these people that are there and so
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
we went from three to 5 so you added the
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
coding person
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
and I think an owner operator owner
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
operator instead of two we'll have one
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
owner operator there's actually three
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
because on the next page there's an
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
owner operator of big parks and the two
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
are of small Parks so and a co-op and uh
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes um Co-op is the Rocks we are talking
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
about correct correct and
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
um and we're putting building coding
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
code person we don't need the fire
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
chief I would I would say the the
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
building code inspector also deals with
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
fire code I believe and so I think
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
that'll cover both usually okay and I
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
see representative G's Point instead of
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
just saying owner operator there's one
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
small Park under 100 one larger than
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
100 those two making it
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
both either or including rocks would
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
make it attractive going
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
forward rather than coming to change
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
the uh statue again if you're making the
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
shift keeping that option open I get
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
that point representative Brown okay
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
so is there some hesitancy and some on
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
the part of the board some conflict
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
potential conflict between co-ops
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
and Ander owner operators where there
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
may be some hesitancy to say we won't
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
have an owner operator and only a co-op
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
am I reading between the lines correctly
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
yes you are correct okay so and follow
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
up follow up knowing that there's one
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
locally where I live one that became a
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
co-op I know that there was quite a bit
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
of um controversy there so I can
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
understand where the manufactured
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
housing authority board might not want
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
to have only a co-op I I think I might
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
understand that if I'm if that makes
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
sense okay and I also maybe I
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstood but I thought I heard two
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
answers to a question that were
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
different um is there currently I
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
thought somebody said that the co-op
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
position was vacant M yeah that's
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
correct okay all right okay thank you if
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
you could Mr chair because there's only
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
10% co-op in New Hampshire versus 90% of
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
a mobile park in Vermont is co-ops well
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
I have to say there's there's 147
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities in the state
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
that far out numbers the privately owned
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
in the state so it's okay uh we could if
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
you could take a seat and have the folks
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
from oplc come
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:35.549 align:start position:0%
from oplc come
up

00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
so uh my first question may be more of a
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
policy one if you don't don't have an
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
answer that's fine and that is um around
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
the owner operator versus Co-op members
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to have both I mean I
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
is there anything you can say on that I
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
think that um as it came up we don't
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
have a pref I think the change that um
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
was proposed uh through the governor's
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
office was because that position has
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
never been filled so that which one the
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
co Cooperative one as was mentioned it's
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
vacant now but it has never been um
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
filled as a board member and to
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
represent M's point I if we put it as um
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
owner operator or Co-op that wouldn't
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
pres wouldn't cause a problem and if we
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
if there's a move in the future as there
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
might be to you know predominantly Co-op
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
at some point then that would
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
offer the flexibility does that seem
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable that's how I would see it as
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
well yes okay oh question to repr M yeah
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Ma Mr chair So currently there
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
are four members so we're cutting down
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
to two from the community which is the
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
housing the man owner or Co-op it used
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
to be four before we're cutting down to
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
with an or with an or so it' be one or
 
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
the other but that's still one member
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah oh
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm completely off now uh line three
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
on page 21 line one on page
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
21 and
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
35 yeah uh on page 20 right what we're
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
proposing is to add back in two
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
positions correct one of them is line is
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
Page 21 5 which is a municipal building
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
code official MH and then the other one
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
is um you know one position which would
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
either be um an owner operator of a
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing park
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
or um a member of a Cooperative
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing oh no I yeah and
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
and without a without a a lot limit
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
right right no no no size limits to any
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
so can I ask for a clarification on page
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
20 30 uh line 33 one dealer or
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
retailer is not a owner of the
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
park correct it's a dealer or retailer
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
of the manufactured hous housing so H so
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
what should end up with is one installer
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
one dealer retailer one um either owner
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
operator or member of a
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
co-op and um the uh the code enforcement
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
person and that's what we would have so
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
you'd have
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
one um right we keep
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
ABC yeah and I I would have a problem
 
00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
with that because the consumer in terms
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
of whether Co-op or um manufacturing
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
Park is only has one seat at the board
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
whereas the provider like if you put in
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
that the structural engineer we need uh
 
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.230 align:start position:0%
that the structural engineer we need uh
the

00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
dealer and
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
installer these are the provider of
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
these mot you know so they have a much
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
large are you following me yeah I the
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
clarification as I'm thinking about it
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
and hearing you talk is that the
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
difference in this board is that they do
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
not have a public member like many of
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
our other boards do it is the um the
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
like Cooperative or owner members
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
someone that's a owner operator so
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's that's I think what it could be
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
sort of related to correct I you you hit
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
the point so I want to make sure the
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
public member is the consumer and we
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
want to have a good representation both
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh owner of a park also the Cooperative
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
so there's more um voice equal voice so
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
I I see I understand the the concern um
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
so I see two ways of dealing with it one
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
is um to stay at five and we would have
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
to drop either an installer or the
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
dealer or retailer or say it would be an
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
installer or a dealer or
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
retailer um so that's an option and then
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
and then add
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
um add a second um two members who are
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
owner operators or or members of Co-op I
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
me that's one way to go the other way
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
we' have to add because we have to stay
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
odd we'd have to add two and so we you
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
know then we could add I
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
suppose um but then you'd have a public
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
member who is a resident of the home is
 
00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
different than an owner operator right
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
it is different I was just trying to say
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
that this board is is unique in the fact
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't have a public member so
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
I think because of the uniqueness of the
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
um profession and the owner operator or
 
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.309 align:start position:0%
um profession and the owner operator or
cooperative

00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
piece of it trying to get the voice to
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
be more specific to the actual
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
profession is why we wouldn't see that
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
there so that's but I was just trying to
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
say that's why there's a little bit of
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
that uniqueness here but where that
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
piece comes in I thought we heard
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
earlier though that and from what I've
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
seen in bill that uh for the advisory
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
boards generally the public member is
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
not included correct so but there also
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
is it one currently that's sort of my
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
point right residents of trailer parks
 
01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
have never had a voice and we had a
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
hearing if you all remember where the
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
residents were quite concerned about not
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
having a voice and about the impact on
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
their lives because these are their
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
homes exact Mr Cherry if I can just that
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
was my concern I understand um you have
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
something represent no I was going to
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
say something political incorrect no
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
no um what about if we added two more
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
and make this a board of seven and we
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
add two to the either or
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
um um add to or make it
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
to make make the one two that's an owner
 
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
operator or Corp keep the or language in
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
there but have two positions under that
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
category and then add a public member
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
who is a
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
resident of one of these Parks or
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
cooperatives well then they couldn't
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
well if they're a member of The
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
Cooperative if they're in living in the
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative they're they're an owner
 
01:01:22.109 --> 01:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what a co-op is so that's
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking what does that mean
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
owner you like to come up and to the mic
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
and provide some I was going to get you
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
before we decided
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so first of all before you get up
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
um is there do you see any problem
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
adding a member from the llc's
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
functional point of view adding a member
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
who is a
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
um a resident I guess in a park but not
 
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.390 align:start position:0%
um a resident I guess in a park but not
a

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
co-op well no we no we're adding two we
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
can do with that adding to right if you
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
want to come up and uh you can help
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
together don't enough to right that is
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
an issue well but then but we're taking
 
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:18.430 align:start position:0%
an issue well but then but we're taking
out

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
of right but they could there could be
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
concerns about if they get overboarding
 
01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:25.269 align:start position:0%
concerns about if they get overboarding
the

01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
I all right um every board that's five
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
deal with this yeah I don't yeah husand
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
to go beyond five but representative
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
Brown so uh correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
which could very well be the
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
case when a person is a resident they
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
buy a mobile home in a
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
park they should understand what their
 
01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.069 align:start position:0%
park they should understand what their
rights

01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
are and how the process works so to come
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
here later and say I don't have a voice
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't they already know what their voice
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
is when they buy their mobile
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
home so I think we might be conflating
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
here um well I'm touching on what these
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
guy said about residents not having a
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
voice oh boy this this could be a whole
 
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
other we don't want to go there well I
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
just not sure if it it's up to the chair
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
as well it's relevant to this situation
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
well it looks like people are are you
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
know questioning so if you can do
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
something briefly yeah okay so you have
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
um privately owned communities and you
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
have resident owned communities okay I
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
represent the privately owned
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
communities what do you mean by
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
privately owned communities so a
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
business owns the park correct not the
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
people living in it correct in the
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities the residents
 
01:03:47.549 --> 01:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
own the parks is that what's meant by
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
Co-op yes okay
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay did you need anything further
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
just a fine yeah distinction
 
01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
is in a resident own they own the land
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
also the well well to clarify it's Wes
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
one I mean they may own their mobile
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
home but the qu I I'm assuming the
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
company owns owns the land exactly
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's the distinction between the rock
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
pay your pay to keep your part your
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
mobile home there like an
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
association well that's a co-op
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
more of these that aren
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
in right people just own them right
 
01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:33.559 align:start position:0%
right well if they if they own the land
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
and they own the mobile home and it's
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
one one on a piece of land then none of
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
this applies representing well they're
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
they're not affected by this I don't
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
think okay they they are so if I may
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
just further clarify yeah when we're
 
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
discussing installing manufactured homes
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
yeah this was brought into place back in
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
200 5 when HUD the federal government
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
said there are too many problems these
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
these homes are not being installed
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
properly either they're falling off the
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
foundations you you know you've got in
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
the the Midwest and on the the eastern
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
coast they have hurricanes we need to do
 
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
something to ensure that these homes are
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
installed correctly so HUD said either
 
01:05:18.269 --> 01:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
you know you follow our standards or
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you come up with
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
your own and so the state of New
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did that now this is only
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
about making sure that a home is
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
installed properly whether it's on a
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
private piece of property whether it's
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
in a resident-owned community or whether
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
or not it's in a private park so when I
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
hear you talking about whether or not
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
the voice of a resident in a resident
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
owned Community is heard with regard to
 
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
installing homes of which they do not
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
install I'm not sure why we would have
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
that concern in this particular issue
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
represent Co thank you so help me
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
understand what and maybe this is an
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
oplc but I think you guys can answer
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
this what are there any issues that the
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
board currently or historically has
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
handled the impact the
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
residents when you hear complaints and
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
complaints it's been a long it's been a
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
long time it's been a long time since
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard and issue um there are very
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
few issues because the program works
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
very well um
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
and people tend to do a good job of
 
01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
installing these homes so I take back my
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
comment because clearly it must have
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
been a different board or some complaint
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
happening it had to do with residents
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
and financing and all of that and you
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
don't handle that just is purely
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
installation the installation of the
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
home on the
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
site thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
clarifying that
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
installing and build
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
retailer code enforcement that is to
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
establish the home once the park is once
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
the home is
 
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
established running of it whether the
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
financing comes from HUD or private or
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
that is not the preview of this board
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
but do the residents have a way to get
 
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
to any complaints after after I think
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
that's actually off topic because if
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
this board isn't dealing with it then
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
it's not put to this bill and we're
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
running late briefly yeah well I just
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
have to make sure everyone understands
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
under the the board and also somehow
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
with the oplc with all the changes that
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
are going on part of HUD in order to be
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
compliant with cud you had HUD you had
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you maintained a
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution program under the
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
installers board so that the
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer the installer and the
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
retailer couldn't each point their
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
finger and say it's their fault not ours
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
so it pulled everyone to the table so
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's what you're talking about correct
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
Mr well we've got the installer we've
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
got the retailer and we've got um either
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who owns the park or at least
 
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
we're proposing um somebody who's a
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
member of One the co-op thing represent
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
Brown um so who
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
C who can make a complaint
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
who legitimately can make a complaint so
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
could a a an individual resident that
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
had a play home installed they could
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
complain to the board it was installed
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
improperly that is correct so there is a
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
little piece where individual residents
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
can come to the board okay yes and
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
that's up to a up to a year after the
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
home's been sold so I I have a question
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
for um the lady sitting uh to the back
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
are you here to speak on this or which
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
which item are
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you just want to make
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
sure sure we're not ignoring somebody on
 
01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:57.090 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:59.189 align:start position:0%
this one
[Music]

01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
um yes if you have so if we have to
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
address that the complaints are
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere there either oplc takes it or
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
the board takes it there has to be a
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
channel because that's the voice of the
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
consumer holding something that may not
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
be satisfactory that was given to them
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
right okay and I'm going to actually
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
asked that can we get oplc back up here
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
thank you musical chairs do you think do
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
you think you would ever get a member of
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
the public to sit thank you and I this
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
is why we love working with our uh
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
associations as well because when we
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
have 57 boards she very eloquently
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
articulated that uh so thank you because
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's the the corrects of it yeah
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
so with it you know if it moves to
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
Advisory board or maybe even what we did
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
last year it may already be set um what
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
would how would complaints be hand
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
handled they would still be processed
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
through the office through what was done
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
last year with 655 so it's consistent as
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
any other board for those complaints and
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
as mentioned with the HUD requirement we
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
are working with the board to uh update
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
their rules so that way their rules
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
point to that current process which is
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the HUD process for
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
the complaints and that's the complaints
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
about the installations that is not the
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
complaints about um the parks or the you
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
know the after um that was repealed last
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
year that complaint board was repealed
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
last year and now is with doj through um
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
any Consumer complaint prot consumer
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
protections correct
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
um okay and would you know what's going
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
on to the rulem and all that would that
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
be significantly affected by moving to
 
01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
an advisory report or would it um what
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing with the installers board
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
is that they rules have been expired um
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
there have been a couple of pieces to
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
that one of them was that they did meet
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
six times last year I'm not sure exactly
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
um what delayed the rules from being uh
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
reopt prior to their expiration uh this
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
would just allow if we went to advisory
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
the members who were attending or
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
available I believe there were a couple
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
meetings where people were there but we
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have Quorum so there wasn't able
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
to be any votes if they were advisory um
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
with their subject matter expertise we
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to move forward in a more
 
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
timely fashion okay all right uh
 
01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you Mr chair I
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
have a question regarding the uh concern
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
that was brought up on um making the
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
change from the board making the
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
appointments to oplc making the
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
appointments can we add language in here
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
that the board will nominate to to the
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
executive director member those
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
positions right that was the next thing
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
I wanted to get to was yeah
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh I mean how would the uh oplc actually
 
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
pick people and um you could we leave in
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
some language that it's nominated but
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
maybe somehow confirmed or whatever by
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
the executive
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
director we talk about this last week um
 
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
I I think one of
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
the you can decide obviously uh one of
 
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
the concerns about the nomination and
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
we've had some conversations over the
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
past few months is how it's currently
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
listed by being need to by needing to be
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
nominated by specific associations we
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
have gotten a few applications for board
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
members that haven't come that route and
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
so we've had to then stop it or ask them
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
to get nominated from another agency and
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
so it has not it has um delayed some of
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
those processes um and although we have
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
board members who have been a part of
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
this board for a very long time many of
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
them are in hold over status as well um
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
so I think there could potentially be
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
language and we could look at that if if
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
um Doug is willing to work with me on
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
that uh and maybe even the association
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
to say what would that language look
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
like so that way it's not each position
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
being nominated by a certain Association
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe a more generalized nomination
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
and definition process right yeah
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
because I wouldn't be comfortable
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
requiring people to be member of a
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
particular Association who serve on the
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
board that's problematic followup
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
representative maputi
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was just going to
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
say it's not either or the board
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
professional board Advisory board can
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
nominate or have the option to do that
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
and oplc also go look for it so finally
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
making the decision what's best for the
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
industry would come up I would assume
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
oplc is going to get ideas on who to put
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
on there from places like just going to
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
anybody can make a recommendation to us
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
so if we left it as executive
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
director it could come from wherever it
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
can come from wherever and and I'd
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
actually be yeah but with just to follow
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
up with that one just with that I'm just
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
saying giving the board and voice also
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
and not cutting them completely because
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
we have to work with them right
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
represent Co you it okay all right
 
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.950 align:start position:0%
represent Co you it okay all right
um

01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah we need
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
to oh the only other question I have had
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
is um uh do oplc have any comment on the
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
um the language that they can't serve
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
more than two full terms there were
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
concerns raised that there may not be
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
enough people available to serve and if
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
you start doing that we could change the
 
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
threeyear term limit we could add
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
consecutive because right now it says
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
two full terms we could add the word
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
consecutive there so that somebody could
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
serve to take some time off come back I
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of options but I don't
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
think we have strong opinions on that
 
01:14:57.239 --> 01:14:58.430 align:start position:0%
think we have strong opinions on that
okay

01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
and would it be a problem we just took
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
that language out because right is there
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
well right now there is apparently is
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
not a limit on how many
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
it Mike sorry that's my understanding as
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
well um it it might be helpful to leave
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
something in there so that way we don't
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
get in a place where we have someone
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
who is not responsive and we're unable
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
to appoint another person because
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're still in their term so I think
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some sort of language
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
um but that can allow for reapplying um
 
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
um but that can allow for reapplying um
or

01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
reappointment re Brown thank you Mr
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just going to follow up again
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
am am I wrong in Remembering we don't
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
have term limits on all these advisory
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
boards or am I remembering too many
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
pieces of too many bills in the last
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
weeks Mr chair the only one I remember U
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative manip Puchi just came up
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
with uh reminded me was the judicial
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
appeals board the other day there were
 
01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
no term limits but normally I've seen
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
term limits on all board appointments
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the concern when you take away term
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
limits is you never know you might get
 
01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
somebody in the on a board that and and
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
just even the tendency becomes it
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
becomes very insula or as uh my
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
colleague to my left likes to say Guild
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
like and um and it just ensures some
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
diversity but I think we could add a
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
year to the the term go from a
 
01:16:35.629 --> 01:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
three-year term to a four-year term two
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
consecutive terms is eight years by then
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
you'd think the board could find a
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
replacement and I um as I'm looking at
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
some of our other advisory boards it
 
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
does have term limits but I do think
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
that word consecutive is an important
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
one um because like Doug um indicated
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
that allows for someone to take a break
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then come back um onto the board
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
whereas the way it's written right now
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
is that that once you're done you're
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
done okay uh R Brown do you have
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
not thank you Mr chair yes I was just
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
say this this leaves you no option if
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
you can't find anybody to fill
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
it but the person that's there would be
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
willing to be nominated but you can't
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
find another person a term limit shuts
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
that down but that's that's the nature
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
of how that works I guess my
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they are able to
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
stay in holdover status I don't know the
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
reference uh to the statute but that if
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
there is no one to fill that and they
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
want to stay in that they can stay in
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
that holdover status until someone else
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
applies for that position perect thank
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
you right and and also as advisory
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
getting a reaching quum is less critical
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
for immediate things that are needed
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
like to make some motions we need to
 
01:17:59.310 --> 01:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
move on um as far as the issue of
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
nominated by who and
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
whatever I would actually like to leave
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
it like it is in the bill where it's um
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's left up to the executive director
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
but I mean the executive director is not
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
going to have I doubt is going to have
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
her Pals in there to St stack the board
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
but they're going to have to get
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
nominated you know suggestions from
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
someplace and my guess is um that would
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
be you know at least partly the
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manufacturer Housing
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
Association so um I'd like to make a
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
motion to um to
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
leave the board appointment the same not
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about membership of the
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
board but how they're
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
appointed nominated or no appointed um
 
01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah y right
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
um keep keep keep what's in the
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill um I would have a problem problem
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
worde my concern would be that we are
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
shifting from Authority from one to
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
another and not helping with making a
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable change that's my you know I
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
mean if we put it in the Statue it's
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
fine now director Courtney is here she
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
understands what it is what our intent
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
is what the you know discussion if there
 
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
is a change at that
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
level if nothing in the statute says
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
this is how it was done or this was the
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
intention there's a nomination you can
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
take you know it's easier not to go back
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
to a referral source to say hey we don't
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to so let's I've got the motion on
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
the floor somebody want to Second it and
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
then we can nobody wants second it it'll
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
fail which is fine okay which I'm okay
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
with all right um so further discussion
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
I I mean it does limit who they can be
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's got to be some installer
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and we're doing the
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
similar thing I mean he's got a a
 
01:20:10.719 --> 01:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
similar thing I mean he's got a a
structural

01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
structural
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
engineer um with at least five worked in
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
the state for at least five years and
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
similarly uh if we decide to put back in
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
the building code official that is
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
nominated by them
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know about that actually whether
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
the U building official association
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
should be nominating
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
the uh code enforcement person that Mr
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
chair I'm okay with how the members are
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
selected it's just saying giving the
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
association an input into nominating
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
process it doesn't have to say it
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to say they have to accept
 
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
it but at least there's a the oplc will
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
refer to it all right it's clear I think
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
clear we're going to have to meet again
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chair um I just want to say on
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
page 21 line 29 it does say the duties
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
of the executive director in
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
consultation with The Advisory Board
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
shall be and then it goes into um does
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
that include the uhin people to the
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
board um so I I believe it may uh in
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
consultation with my legal counsel uh
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
also when we're looking at some of our
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
other Advisory Board uh medical imaging
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
has language in there that Under The
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
Advisory board established that says The
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board shall advise the
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
executive director regarding the
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
Implement implementation of this chapter
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
so it's specific to the structure of The
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and so it states that so
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
we I can um email that over or you can
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
look at that reference but that might be
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
something there is already statutory
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
language for other advisory boards okay
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
so that would um that might change the
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
language on uh page 21
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
line9 shell is a better thing than
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
may it says in consultation uh sh yeah
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that as long as there is
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
shell not me okay so um yes chair on
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
page 20 line
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
27 it says that these people will be
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
appointed by
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
the executive director of The Office of
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
professional lur and certification if we
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
insert in consultation with The Advisory
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
board right there I think we cover it
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right um so shall consult so
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
let's go that would be page 20 line 28
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
because I will not remember any of this
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
but um I'll in consult in consultation
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
with The Advisory board if you just go
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
back to page 21 line 29 shall
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
be you know that shell I think there's a
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
shell on the end there well the duty
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
shall be yeah but this would make it
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
very clear that the appointment would be
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
in consultation
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
will um I will amend my
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
motion to include that change so we'll
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
add in consultation with The Advisory
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
board on on page 20
 
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh line 28 or 27 and
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
28 I will second it Mr chair well okay
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
so we already we have a motion I'm just
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
amending the motion if if representative
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
Bailey's okay with that change since he
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
seconder okay so we'll just keep the
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
original motion with that change all
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
right um all in so what we're voting
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
on is basically to accept the whole
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
installer board part it'll become an
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
um we can change the um as the the
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
membership as we discussed which would
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
be what's that from 9 to5 we'd have a
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
owner operator or Co-op one member and
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
we would add back in the code
 
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.310 align:start position:0%
we would add back in the code
enforcement

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
person and
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
um and then uh the changes to the
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
language change from three to four years
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
term and and to add a consecutive full
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
term so that people could come back
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
on um and that's so that that's what the
 
01:24:42.669 --> 01:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
motion is so everyone in favor oh you
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
have more discussion Y no well it is
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
it's a comment I think just kind of for
 
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
the record I think that making the
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
nominating process uh
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
taking it maybe solely out of the hands
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
of of the executive director is is a
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
because not myself but there are there
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
are a number of people that always
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
question what government is doing
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of how how good of a job
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing having worked there for 30
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
years I know how that works and and it's
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
people will question it sometimes no
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
matter what so I think that adding this
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
in to have consultation with the board
 
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
on nominations will make
 
01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.750 align:start position:0%
on nominations will make
that

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
process the perception of that to be
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
more transparent okay thank you Mr uh
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay rep that's I second it that's
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
exactly was my point Thank you very good
 
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:39.639 align:start position:0%
so um the motion is as described all in
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
favor I anyone
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you so we have
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
completed the
 
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
housing manufactured housing
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
installation section
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
on to massage therapist page 25
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
24 line 35 26 line 3 one and let me get
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
to that and OPC can stay up there Mr
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
chair this is one of the boards that
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
they asked correct to go on to it should
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
be an easier transition because actually
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
I just got a good uh suggestion and that
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
is since we have someone here
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh wiffy Council why don't we move to

line
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
32 let me get find it
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
here um we'll leave oplc up there for
 
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.669 align:start position:0%
here um we'll leave oplc up there for
the

01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
moment so that's there
 
01:26:45.239 --> 01:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
moment so that's there
through

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:46.250 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
through
[Music]

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
um page 29 line 23 so there's all this
 
01:26:58.830 --> 01:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
stuff and okay so if we go
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and if we can if you need to have a
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
discussion we can leave time for it but
 
01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.910 align:start position:0%
discussion we can leave time for it but
otherwise

01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
um representative G and Bailey is there
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
something we need to hear or no we were
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
just at the one yes I was looking for
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
the end page oh the end page on that one
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
I believe is page 26 line 31 unless I
 
01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.430 align:start position:0%
I believe is page 26 line 31 unless I
messed

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
upid oh the Midwifery is I think page 29
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
line 23 it
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
is okay all right
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
so going through this as usual with
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
these things there makes it
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
advisory um and actually quick question
 
01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
on the last one oplc how many of these
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh installers are there because we get
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
into the question of one of the
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
arguments for Advisory Board is there's
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
but then we'll go to the same question
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
then for Midwife I don't have that data
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
but I can get that for you is it fairly
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
small you think yes okay um and we also
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony they can't find members
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the board because there aren't enough
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
people in the profession LIC okay so now
 
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
we're on same question question actually
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
for the Midwifery um how
 
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.629 align:start position:0%
for the Midwifery um how
many

01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
huh no no the installation of what they
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
work on is a different process but but
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a growing profession what it's
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not a licensed profession at
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
all um I can speak from family anyway um
 
01:28:44.590 --> 01:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
so how many licensed midwives are there
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
about it's around
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
30 okay thank you no I just wanted to
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
ask the same question
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm my job is to really straight man
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's an ugly job but somebody's got to
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
do it um all right so
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
um let me get back here so Mr chair
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
before we go any that uh the to reduce
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce barrier those things that
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
changed right I sent you the email out
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
where I'd have them do it everywhere I
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
mean I I called all the places so we're
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
going to do that and and the other
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
General changes um that we agreed on so
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to briefly talk to this
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
so there's the what the sections are so
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's the making advisory which uh
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
given the small number of midwives I
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
think is important um then changes to
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
the advisory Council which we'll need to
 
01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:37.270 align:start position:0%
the advisory Council which we'll need to
go

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
through and um the rest of it is mostly
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
I think the standard um moving to a
 
01:29:49.109 --> 01:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and then there's a couple
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
other things like on page 28 line line
 
01:29:57.149 --> 01:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
um 22 is taking out the board having fee
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
setting Authority which last year we
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
moved to oplc anyway and that needs to
 
01:30:01.719 --> 01:30:02.629 align:start position:0%
moved to oplc anyway and that needs to
be

01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
done and um the rest of it is
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
um it basically part of making Advisory
 
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.550 align:start position:0%
um it basically part of making Advisory
Board

01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
Board
 
01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:14.350 align:start position:0%
Board
um

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
so if we actually probably the best for
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
when unless oplc has got some overall
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
comments then like to have the uh person
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
here is going
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
to who came to speak come up and uh
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
introduce herself
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
input hi thank you for hearing me today
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
I'm Sher you get close to the mic please
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
we can pull the whole thing forward if
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's easier yep I'm Sher Stevens I'm in
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire certified midwife and we
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
have 33 um midwives currently um
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
certified and three
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
pending as what and three pending oh
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
three pending yeah three in the
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
process okay so anything else you'd like
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
to say yeah so my concern is um first of
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
all putting us into a Advisory Board in
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
general because I know we are a small U
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
population and we're a small board um
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
but we do deal with um
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
maternity care we take care of pregnant
 
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
people and we deliver babies and we
 
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
think this is a public health issue to
 
01:31:31.629 --> 01:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
have an executive director or somebody
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
other than the experts in the field
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
regulating our board and this takes away
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
our ability for rul making and and um
 
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications as I spoke to yesterday
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
as well as you know we understand oplc
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
we absolutely 100% behind them doing the
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
administrative work doing the um running
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
the running the board meetings um
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
certification process and the
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary process we understand
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
that's happening and we're we're okay
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
with that we've been wanting support for
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
for many many years we're really happy
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
for that um and but in terms of moving
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
away from having somebody else telling
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
this profession um you know what our
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications are and how we practice
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
as a concern argue that that's a
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization it's it is required
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
in here on for all of the advisor boards
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
that they have to do it executive
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
director has to do it in consultation
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
with the board um and if they do
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
something wacky anyway then it's still
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
got to go through the rules you know
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
541a process of of uh public comment and
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know you tell jail Jael
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
car that they've done something insane
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh but but there's a general uh feeling
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
from legal liability issues that any any
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
board with uh fewer than 200 licensed
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
people really should become an Advisory
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
Board and midwy one is pretty extreme in
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
that regard so from a
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
um Li not just liability but I mean you
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
know is it right and ethical for Market
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
participants when you have that small
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
number uh to actually regulate direct
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
and have direct final control over the
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
rest of the market participants and I
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
think there's a a general feeling that
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
that is not the case and that that's not
 
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.270 align:start position:0%
that is not the case and that that's not
appropriate

01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
and and subject to leaves the state and
 
01:33:27.629 --> 01:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
the board subject to uh legal action if
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
uh some somebody doesn't like the
 
01:33:33.790 --> 01:33:33.800 align:start position:0%
outcome so and we we had a we spent an
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
hour or plus dealing with that at the
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of all these hearings so and I
 
01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
apologize I wasn't here that hearing um
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
so the other part is that you have it
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
down to um two midwives and one
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
physician so there's a big difference
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
between a pediatrician and obstetrician
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
One deals with with um pregnant women
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
when deals with the baby they are not
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
the same expertise in in any shape or
 
01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
form and so I know that they the current
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
um ones that serve on the board have a
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
real issue with that and the two
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
midwives we would when we had done going
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
back to hb2 and had looked at this we
 
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
had asked for um three midwives and two
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
Physicians we do have a public member
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
which we value very much um I could
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
consider two midwives a public member
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
and the two Physicians we had I think
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
they had wanted to put it to five so
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a um you know a more
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
majority rule as opposed to six six has
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
been working great we've been having um
 
01:34:35.070 --> 01:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings we have Quorum we have
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
a plenty of people that have been
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
willing to serve and serve well we are
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
always um you know whatever these
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
Physicians are it says expertise with um
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
midw free that could be friendly or not
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
there are midw uh there are Physicians
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
out there that are not friendly to to
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
our profession and so we are very um
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
acutely aware of that and in in our
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
profession as a whole and having an
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and having this go
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
down to what we were we were told and
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
what we understand is advisory committee
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
is um they they ask the um board The
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
Advisory board our expert opinion but
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
they can also just not do it you know
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that we would hope in good faith
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
that is that is true and and like um the
 
01:35:24.189 --> 01:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
pres was saying director Courtney has
 
01:35:26.109 --> 01:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
been you know supportive and wonderful
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
and if she leaves and we get somebody in
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't like midwe free we're out
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
they can just stop our profession you I
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
and it has happened in other states
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
right and I okay so I I think going to
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh Advisory Board is something that we
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
need to do uh given the small number of
 
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
midwives so we've covered that however
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're definitely open to changing the
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
membership from what this bill
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
proposes and so the question is if you
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a quick question for let
 
01:35:57.109 --> 01:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
me let me finish what I'm saying
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
please um so my we'll get to that my
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
question is um you mentioned three
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
midwives and two Physicians if we went
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
that route um would you would just be
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
two Physicians or or back to one
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
obstetrician one pediatrician one
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
obstetrician one pediatrician okay and
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
in generally The Advisory boards don't
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
have public members and so that would
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
there would be a five member board okay
 
01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.310 align:start position:0%
there would be a five member board okay
represent

01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
mapy quick question to the midv do you
 
01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:26.840 align:start position:0%

01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
becoming an Advisory
 
01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.629 align:start position:0%
becoming an Advisory
Board

01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
Board
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what the reason for
 
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
if safety no there the issue the issue
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
is different it's there are a lot of
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
physicians in the state and you don't
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
have the problem where a group of Market
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
participants um um are are regulating
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
you know are making it are regulating a
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
small community of licensed people if
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
you have I mean the current membership
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
you got six you got one fifth of all
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
practicing midwives on the board which
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
means they're deciding they presumably
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
most of them know each other they're
 
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
deciding you know complaints and who can
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
get license to this small group of
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
people and that's a serious conflict of
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
interest where with the doctors there's
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
many more doctors and so why you can
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
argue it's not a nonissue but it is
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically less of an issue and and
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
then I mean the complaints can are
 
01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
different we do not handle the
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
complaints currently oplc has taken that
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
over so that that is separated separated
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
from us can somebody from oplc get up um
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
there are very few complaints there's
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
been one or two over over the 30 years
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
oh okay that's great um I I guess my
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
question on that is if there were a
 
01:38:51.149 --> 01:38:51.159 align:start position:0%
complaint I know the investigation and
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
and that is handled by oplc but um as
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
far as making a decision on whether or
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
not it's valid is they would they be
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
Consulting with the board now and also
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
is what's the case if it's advisory yes
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
even if it's advisory it would still go
 
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
to the board um for review and subject
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
matter expertise if needed um but if
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
there was an inability to have a quorum
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
or to get to that place then the um
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority still rests on opl
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so we would be able to move forward
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
with that if it's an Advisory Board
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
correct but at a regulatory board does
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
the board basically make the final
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
decision on it oplc would do the
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
investigation and present maybe uh Doug
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
can pushing me out of the way I know we
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
need three seats up there maybe I don't
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
so we receive the complaint we do an
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
investigation we don't need any
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
authority to the board then we bring
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
that to the board with a recommendation
 
01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
but the board decides whether or not to
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
move forward with dis discipline or
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
dismiss the case if they move forward
 
01:39:52.270 --> 01:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
with discipline the board is the finder
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
of fact so they kind of say we think
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
this happened we think this happened and
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
oplc steps in on kind of the legal side
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
running the hearing hearing officers
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
answering you know calling balls and
 
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
Strikes so today with this uh regulatory
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
board we solv the problem where members
 
01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
of this very small group of people is
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
making decisions for a a relatively
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
small number of members in their
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
profession and that's problematic
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you represent man py
 
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair another quick
 
01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:25.719 align:start position:0%
question for the midv is
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
this spread ACR obviously it's spread
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
across the state is this addressing the
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
pockets of rural Pockets where the
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
access to the hospital or access to
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
health care for pregnant women is
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
addressed we are very much concerned
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
about that in the closing of the the
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
different birthing hospitals um they are
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
midwives located in all areas of the
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
state there's probably one in the North
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
Country so that is an issue um but that
 
01:40:58.990 --> 01:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
again getting more Midwife into the
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
state and and more midwives practicing
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
is our goal and we are looking at um
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
being able to support the doctors and
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
the clinics and things like that with
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
our care to be able to reach out to the
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
rural pockets and we do because we are
 
01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
experts in home care and we can go and
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
do home visits you know and I've
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
suggested um that we make a partnership
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
where we could we could easily do a
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
prenal visit or doing a um blood
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
pressure or something like that and then
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the doctor if that was
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
their highrisk pa okay I mean this is
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
really not the bill please we need to
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
stop that because we actually have a
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
chance of getting done today other than
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
approving the final Amendment so I'd
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion um which is to
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
adopt a section on
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
Midwifery um with the
 
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
change of the membership of the board um
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
change ing it to three midwives and I
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
think there's a def yeah certified yep
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
and 1 OB and we'll put back in the 1 OB
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
and the one pediatrician with expertise
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
with the yes the current language that's
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
in there with the with this uh pertinent
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
experience I just leave take the current
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
language and put it back in for those
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
two and
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
U so you're making the change on line 8
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
off page 27 in instead of six going to
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
five members right there'd be a number
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
of changes it would go to Five members
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
um the number of midwives would go to
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
three rather than two and we would put
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
back in on lines uh 16 through 18 or 16
 
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
through 19 the um the doctors with the
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate suest
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh represent well first of all I I put
 
01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
the motion on somebody want to Second it
 
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
then we can have discussion okay fine
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
procedural all right representative
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
Brown yeah I I don't know if it's listed
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
in duy somewhere else but do we want to
 
01:43:02.550 --> 01:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
include as we did in the last one so now
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
on page 27 line 10 midwy Council
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
appointed by the executive director in
 
01:43:12.270 --> 01:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with the board is what we
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
did last time right so you're looking at
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
line 10 after the
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
Bold okay so that's page 27
 
01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:22.750 align:start position:0%
Bold okay so that's page 27
line

01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
10 um what did we say with consultation
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
of the advisory repard whatever you said
 
01:43:31.229 --> 01:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
in the last one shall shall consult no
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
no that's that's not how that no the
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
shall came after the in consultation on
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
the last but but it could be the
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
exective I mean I'm okay with that but
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
we can uh Doug if you can get up here if
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
we just say the executive director of
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
The Office of professional license and
 
01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
certification in consultation with the
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
board um and we're talking about page 27
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
line 10 line 10 I think that creates a
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
requirement re to work with the that's
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
what I was thinking it's it's not a May
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
so that's something we you're saying you
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
we do this we will do this even without
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
the word shall it's kind
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
of um I'm fine with that so I will I
 
01:44:15.070 --> 01:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
will um thank you update my motion to
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
include that and if representative Brown
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
the second or agrees with that I agree
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
with that all right fine
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the motion to adopt this
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
section with the change of adding that
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
language that they have to consult on
 
01:44:30.669 --> 01:44:30.679 align:start position:0%
the appointments three midwives one ob
 
01:44:33.629 --> 01:44:33.639 align:start position:0%
one pediatrician raising the total to
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
five um as long as that is there I'm
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
fine with okay um all in favor I all
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
opposed okay that's unanimous so and
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
just a procedural thing when I'm going
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
to do like I did before I'm going to
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
take the list of all the changes I will
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
update it with this stuff and I'll send
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
it out to people and look at it I'll try
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
and you know do it accurately and that
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
what we may do um at a future hearing is
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
throw this one at the top and get a a
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
formal vote on approving the whole thing
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
so okay um we're done with the Midwife
 
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
one thank
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
you what's that no thank thank you thank
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
you though
 
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
yes I mean you can still uh submit
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
written comment to fully DNA if you'd
 
01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.270 align:start position:0%
written comment to fully DNA if you'd
like

01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
so okay uh let's go back to combining uh
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board which is already an
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board massage therapist and the
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
board of reflexology page 24 line 35
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
through 26 l31
 
01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.669 align:start position:0%
through 26 l31
yes

01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair this is the one which has
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
more members it's more than 200 correct
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
and they ask to be done yeah if oplc can
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
going give an introduction to what's
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
going on with
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
this so massage is already an Advisory
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
Board they do have more members but the
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
reflexology um and structural Integrity
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
in Asian Body Works does not and so they
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
are looking to merge they're about how
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
many uh I will get that for you and just
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
so you know um for home
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
installers uh we H currently have 64
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
licensed home installers oh jeez okay so
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's well under the the 200
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
thing okay um so the issue on the board
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
side I the number of licensed people's
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
reflexology and we can fix that by
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
merging them with which page um okay so
 
01:46:35.709 --> 01:46:35.719 align:start position:0%
this is starting on page 24 near the
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
bottom at line
 
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
35 through line page
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
26 um 31 31 right thank
 
01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:49.390 align:start position:0%
26 um 31 31 right thank
you

01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.669 align:start position:0%
you
and

01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
and so if you so you said this request
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
came from the board of reflexology or
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
where did it okay I'm not sure if it
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
came from the board but I know I we have
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
not heard any opposition on this I think
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
we've even had conversations with them
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
and they agree with the change okay but
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
conversations right and that's my
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
recollection Mr chair right and it looks
 
01:47:19.470 --> 01:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
like and there was no concern about the
 
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
membership of the board or anything else
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
raised a quick question for oplc even
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
though it is more than 200 members it's
 
01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
close to three or
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
400 combining would that make a
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
difference for advisory or
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
statutary well it's already advisory
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
both of them already advisory so that's
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
not an issue for us question no one is
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
advisory and one does not have a is that
 
01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
true I think they're both advisory both
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
both advisory that's we're just merging
 
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
what the analysis um says anyway and
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
already is don't have to worry about
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
that right I
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
mean I'm going to make a motion and then
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
we can have discussion afterwards and
 
01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
that is to adopt or to keep keep this
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
section as
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
is okay this is the section on the
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
merger of these two boards which is Page
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
20 uh
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
sorry it start what I just said yeah it
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
starts at look 24 line 35 okay I'll put
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
that on page 24 line
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
35 page 26 L 31 line 31 yeah that's the
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
motion to keep that as
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
is um I think you
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
know and issue I mean how I know she's
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
looking up how many reflexologists but
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
have been problems 21 21 oh jeez and uh
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
so uh even advisory so there have been
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
problems just getting people to serve on
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
that board or has that not been a
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
problem um correct we now have we do
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
have three members on that advisory on
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
that board now um but it has been about
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
trying to find times when they can meet
 
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
and having Quorum and again the issue of
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
the you know three members and 21 active
 
01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:09.639 align:start position:0%
licenses even though they're advisory
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
there's still issues with that right
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay um do I have a second for that
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
motion yes uh one more question it sure
 
01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:24.030 align:start position:0%
Asian Arts is part of reflexology
 
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:25.550 align:start position:0%
Asian Arts is part of reflexology
[Music]

01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%

board of
 
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
reflexology um I want to get the
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%

lenses okay thank you so any further
 
01:49:57.629 --> 01:49:57.639 align:start position:0%

01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
see anywhere in here the similar
 
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:02.390 align:start position:0%
see anywhere in here the similar
language

01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
to um having the executive director do
 
01:50:05.719 --> 01:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
to um having the executive director do
the

01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
appointments seems to be missing in
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
consult even the regardless of yeah the
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
in consultation unless I just I'm
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
missing it yeah where is the appointment
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
stuff it's usually in with the the the
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
the the the structure of the board
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
itself it is on page 25 line 21 members
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
shall be appointed oh sorry it just
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's yeah and you're hitting my point
 
01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
exactly it just says they shall be
 
01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.030 align:start position:0%
exactly it just says they shall be
appointed

01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:50:40.589 --> 01:50:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
24 yeah that's P page 25 line 24 the
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
board shall advise the executive
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
director regarding the implementation of
 
01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
this chapter and then up above on line
 
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
18 it says the executive director shall
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
establish The Advisory Board and so that
 
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
gives some of this wouldn't be bolded
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
because it's existing existing so that
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
gives her the authority to make the
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
appointments and and it requires that
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
she do that with uh the advice of the
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
board it's saying the same thing in a
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
circular fashion doing it differently
 
01:51:13.629 --> 01:51:13.639 align:start position:0%
yeah the word shall is there so there is
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
a consultation so a lot of this language
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
was lifted from existing statute we
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies just as long as everyone
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
of the s that that's is what that means
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
right and ultimately the courts but well
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
right so do we have to have any further
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
discussion or can we move yeah it's
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
double negative triple negative makes it
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
positive I think you're right okay all
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
all in favor of doing this keeping it as
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
is anyone
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
opposed alrighty so we are
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
done with the merge of these two boards
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
we only
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
have system in lers well we have the
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
septic system and then we've got the
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
board of examiners of uh nursing home
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
administrators so um let's do septic
 
01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:07.950 align:start position:0%
administrators so um let's do septic
system

01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
next how about the eight the nursing
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
home that's a small I just said I just
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
said that's another yeah that's a small
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
one right I mean we don't have anybody
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
here to speak on either one that's a
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
quick one um yeah um that that's the
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
board you just repealed in no no that
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
was nine oh Board of registration of
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
medical technicians and we already okay
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
agreed the subcommittee agreed to pull
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
that out the ones that I think are left
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
are on the analysis seven and eight the
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
septic system evaluators turned them
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
into advisory and the same thing for the
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
board of examiners of nursing home
 
01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
administrators that's what I have to so
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
unless there's a reason to take them in
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
a different order I was going to take
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
them in order here and that would be the
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
septic system I don't know if there's a
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
reason but the nursing home
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
administrators was at the request of the
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
board okay let's do that one first that
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
six

01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
it and that goes
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
through uh so this is a nurse
 
01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.229 align:start position:0%
through uh so this is a nurse
Jing

01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
home and that is um page
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
34 line six through
 
01:53:33.159 --> 01:53:35.229 align:start position:0%
34 line six through
Page

01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
Page
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
39 line six as well okay um if you can
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
just give an overview of of what's going
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
on here and who was okay with it or not
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
um So currently we have 155 active Li
 
01:53:51.510 --> 01:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing home administrators in
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
the State uh the board has uh been
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
supportive of moving to an Advisory
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
Board um they are able to provide
 
01:54:04.069 --> 01:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
insight and support they do attend their
 
01:54:07.069 --> 01:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
meetings regularly but I believe they
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
understand the um change to be advisory
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
would be helpful in that they are a
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
small board uh and very involved with
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
each other and all of the
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
lienes okay and they didn't have a
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
problem with uh the proposed board
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
membership going down to three not that
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
we've heard no okay so they they are
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
okay with three
 
01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
Bailey all go up to the mic are there
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
are there only 155 nursing homes in the
 
01:54:43.629 --> 01:54:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
or I don't know the answer to that um I
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
think some of the LI some of the nursing
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
homes have fall under more than one
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
administrator so um like larger
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
corporations like genesis might have a
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator that covers
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
three or four different locations um but
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
this is one of those boards where DHHS
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
does the licensing of the facilities we
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
license the
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
profession thank you okay 10 County and
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
rest of it private okay so um I'll do it
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion to
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
um to keep de this as
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:28.069 --> 01:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
bill and I need a
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
second second okay thank
 
01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
you and any further um discussion before
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
we go to a vote um Brown I'm just trying
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
to follow up on the appointment piece
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
again the nomination and appointment
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
piece that's all because a lot of that
 
01:55:45.159 --> 01:55:47.589 align:start position:0%
piece that's all because a lot of that
was

01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
stricken on page 3 4 line
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
2122 appointed by the executive
 
01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.550 align:start position:0%
2122 appointed by the executive
director

01:55:57.550 --> 01:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
um it it's the same language like the
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
previous one page 34 where uh
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
line 15 to 18 the executive director
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
shall cons consult with The Advisory
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
Board to establishing
 
01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:15.870 align:start position:0%
established that was
 
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:17.149 align:start position:0%
established that was
[Music]

01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and that got left in that gener
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
General language right it did yeah and
 
01:56:25.149 --> 01:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
the stuff the workforce barrier stuff I
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
took out long right okay thank you
 
01:56:30.069 --> 01:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
that's good okay um any further
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
discussion we can move to a
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
vote all right all in favor of uh
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
keeping the section as it is in the bill
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
I anyone opposed oh great five to zero
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
all right in that case we have one
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
more and we get to deal with uh sewage
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
no septic evaluators so that is let make
 
01:56:56.189 --> 01:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
notes and that's
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
um page
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
29 line
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
24 through Page
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
34 line
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
five um let me get to the start of that
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
and if you can give kind of any
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
introduction to what what the deal is
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
how mean how many of them there are what
 
01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
was behind
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
this I believe this comes down to the
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
numbers again there's about
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
135 um LIC licensed septic system
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
evaluators uh which has also and we've
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
also seen some Quorum issues uh with
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
this board and so this will assist in uh
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
those meetings being able
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
to uh happen without uh uh Quorum so in
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
2023 they had six meetings uh scheduled
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
and three of them were cancelled um in
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
2022 there were five meetings SCH
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled and two of those canceled so
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
in 2022 there were only three meetings
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
in 2023 there were three meetings as
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
well um so this will assist in the the
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
operations and Licensing of these Prof
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
this profession yes has there been much
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the way of complaints they've had to
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
or I don't have those numbers but I
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
could gather that information that's all
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
right any any questions from the
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee you already asked one so how
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
does the complaint now flow
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
through it's the same as uh all of the
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
other board processes so the complaint
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
comes through the office it is reviewed
 
01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
and investigated uh by the office that
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
is then brought to the board um to
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
decide the next steps um and process
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
like the other regulatory boards the
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
statutory ones not advisory regulatory
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh re of course I noticed it's
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
septic system evaluators as opposed to
 
01:58:55.709 --> 01:58:55.719 align:start position:0%
installers does that imply it's for
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
existing septic systems or somehow or is
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
are the evaluators the ones that approve
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
plans for what do they do actually I
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
guess I'm looking it
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
up you should know this if I may I
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
should know this the board of septic
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
system evaluators is established to set
 
01:59:13.629 --> 01:59:13.639 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and guidelines to
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that licensed evaluators have a
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
level of knowledge well yeah that's kind
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
of what evaluating student hang on a
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
so but this is more informational it
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that in here unless we need
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
an answer on this I I'd like to move
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
just curious somebody want to make a
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
motion on this well I'll make a motion
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
it could certainly be that I if you have
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
a question about a septic system you
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
have someone come in to assess its
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
condition maybe that's an a Valu I'm
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
guessing that I mean I will say I just
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
La last year spent a ton of money
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
replacing my septic system and uh we had
 
01:59:57.310 --> 01:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
to get uh plans drawn up and somebody
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
had who was licensed I guess had to
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
approve the plans and I'm wondering if
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's that person I believe that's the
 
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
process trying to read this and life
 
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
experience I believe that you have
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
someone who does the plans and installs
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
it but then you have to have someone
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
come out like a building code insector
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
something the surveyor has to come out
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
they provide input to the engineer the
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
engineer draws the plans and then
 
02:00:21.390 --> 02:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that has to approve
 
02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
those plans and town the building
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
inspector gets involved too ours does Mr
 
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
chair yeah my husband was a licensed
 
02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
septic and we just had this discussion
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the other night so I apologize I missed
 
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
your whole conversation but I can
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
confirm that once it's all laid in place
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
somebody comes and inspects it um for in
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
a case he talked about in hener it was
 
02:00:45.310 --> 02:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
the building inspect building code
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
inspector for the town but what does the
 
02:00:49.069 --> 02:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh the evaluator do the septic syst
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
system evaluator what's their part in
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
this whole
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
process I don't know the answer to that
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you is if you're watching
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
secret a secret from you all right uh
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
represent M yeah so does this the
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
evaluator also looks at the leeching and
 
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
all that stuff that's part of the whole
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
septic system okay I will say that this
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't change the scope of
 
02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
practice okay so it's really not
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
pertinent not pertinent okay so I made
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
the motion to keep this section as is I
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
need a
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
second all right uh
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
Brown um any more discussion need it
 
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
before we go to a vote I don't hear
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
anything all in favor I anyone
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you and if uh I'm
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
looking at this correctly we are done
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
except what I will do is like I did for
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
what can we go back to that inside there
 
02:01:52.589 --> 02:01:52.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yes we did it so um as I did with
 
02:01:55.069 --> 02:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
1410 I will finish that right up on the
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
changes it'll go to
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
oplc um for an
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
amendment and I will send it to
 
02:02:05.310 --> 02:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
oplc and then I mean I could send out to
 
02:02:07.149 --> 02:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
everybody as well at the same time and
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
that way you could catch anything I did
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
wrong Mr just for my clarification so we
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
did do the occupant license and family
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
mediator that was not done or that was
 
02:02:21.790 --> 02:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
let which one the acupuncture
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
licensing and that was done as an
 
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
Advisory board or which one is that I
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't the number one and two oh yeah we
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
did that the first one number one and
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
two the family mediator I don't remember
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
the family mediator we finished this
 
02:02:36.189 --> 02:02:36.199 align:start position:0%
morning we worked on last time and that
 
02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
was the guardian and light them stuff oh
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay alls no no yeah I think so let me
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
finish with the process so I I will send
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
it to ol I will get an amendment and
 
02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:50.119 align:start position:0%

02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
will add this bill at the top and then
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
we can formally vote to adopt the
 
02:02:57.149 --> 02:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
whatever oplc comes up with our fine
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
problems Mr chair uh Guardian at Liam is
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
number three we didn't do number two
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
converts the board of family mediator we
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
did actually we did although today no
 
02:03:16.069 --> 02:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
earlier um at least that's in my
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
records um we we did that right in order
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
we went we went in ordered through
 
02:03:21.709 --> 02:03:21.719 align:start position:0%
everything the only thing that went out
 
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
of order was the massage therapist and
 
02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
and the and eliminating the uh medical
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
technicians one since we got rid of that
 
02:03:27.639 --> 02:03:29.069 align:start position:0%
technicians one since we got rid of that
in

02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:03:29.079 --> 02:03:34.990 align:start position:0%
in
141

02:03:34.990 --> 02:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
um that's we're trying to settle on
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether that's everybody's in agreement
 
02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:47.870 align:start position:0%
whether that's everybody's in agreement
on

02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
um no I don't think that's a requirement
 
02:04:01.549 --> 02:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
although I um so are are we okay on this
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
we're good okay I'm going to close the
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
um subcommittee work session House Bill
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
1271 um and as I said we'll one of the
 
02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
other ones I schedule I'll put at the
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
beginning once I've got a a uh thing
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
from oplc and we can have the approve it
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully so do you want to the schule
 
02:04:21.390 --> 02:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
now uh no what I asked to I don't want
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
to look at it here what I want to do is
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
have everybody tell me when they're
 
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
available or not available for the week
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
the week of March 4th and the early part
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
of the following
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
week because Carol wants to exact all
 
02:04:41.229 --> 02:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
the bills by March 13th or actually is
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe the full following week
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually I should
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
say let me what email I cannot remember
 
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
anything uh March 13th is yeah she's got
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
EXA so so here's here's the deal um
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
anything we have left we're going to
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
have to complete before March 13th and
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
we're not going to meet the week of the
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
24th through the 3 and so I'm hoping as
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
as many days as possible in that first
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
week of March and the first couple
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
days of the next week that you know
 
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
people be available but let me know and
 
02:05:20.069 --> 02:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
what I'll do is I'll take
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully um all the days that we're all
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
available and if that's not enough I'll
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
have to talk to Carol if we can get
 
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else as a sub um because we
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
have to get done and also as I said I I
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
was worked to get rid of some of our
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
bills off to other subcommittees and but
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
the big thing is we have to do um well
 
02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
we got 12:22 and I think 1408 you'll get
 
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
a new if it hasn't come out yet you'll
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
get a new notice and we'll start next
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
Tuesday with um 1408 which is another 40
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
some page thing like this and we're off
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh correct because they're off
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
tomor little quick announcement Glen
 
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:03.880 align:start position:0%

deing well but Bill is committed to
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
helping me get he to so I'm praying say
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
prayers for two that aren't doing well
 
02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.069 align:start position:0%
prayers for two that aren't doing well
they

02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
trip I don't know what's typical uh for

sheep well Finn she multiple verse are
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
typical and I talked to the Midwife lady
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
she was
 
02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:33.310 align:start position:0%
she was
mention

02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.189 --> 02:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
men and the emails come out for the
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
revision to Tuesday's meeting so it's
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%

02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
and get as far as we can if we can get
