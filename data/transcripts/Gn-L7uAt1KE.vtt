introducing s sp48 on behalf of Senator
 
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
Denise rardy the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
this bill should look very familiar to
 
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
you is it is very similar to HB
 
00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 align:start position:0%
1168 creating a committee to study the
 
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
effects of the housing crisis on the
 
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
disability uh community and hopefully
 
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
recommending policy solutions that can
 
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
strengthen opportunities for
 
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
Independents the Senate is scheduled to
 
00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 align:start position:0%
approve HB 1168 next week but with an
 
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I would like you to note the
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
Senate HHS committee extended the final
 
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
reporting date to November 1st
 
00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
2025 and added an interim report for
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
2024 uh I would suggest you coordinate
 
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
with Senator bsel rather than pass two
 
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
overlapping but slightly different
 
00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
studies into law if you have any
 
00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 align:start position:0%
questions I can get them to Senator
 
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
rardy and make sure to get you an answer
 
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 align:start position:0%
Senator rardy thanks you for your
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
consideration and support for Senate
 
00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 align:start position:0%
Bill 48 thank you thank you for your
 
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
bossy my only question is does senate oh
 
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
does Senator vardi support the bill as
 
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
amended in the Senate yes it it went
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
through with unanimous support it's on
 
00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar everybody agrees
 
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
giving the committee an extra year we're
 
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
a lot closer to November 1st than when
 
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
we first heard the bill and that was one
 
00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
of the concerns as well and the concerns
 
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
was giving them enough time but still
 
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
getting some information out by November
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
1st and then giving them until 2025 to
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
get a final report in so my only
 
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 align:start position:0%
question would be legislators that are
 
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
appointed to that committee that decide
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
not to run for re-election or reelected
 
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
are they still serving on that committee
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
uh they would be reappoint you would
 
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
fill any vacancy Poss new member if
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
those if those members weren't reelected
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
or didn't choose to run thank you other
 
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions see none oh I think that makes
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
per perfect sense okay thank you thank
 
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so I just have a question in
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
comparing uh the Senate bill that you've
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
just introduced with House Bill 1168
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
which as you know is remarkably
 
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
similar um the Senate
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
Bill specifies studying the effects of
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
the 2008 housing crisis which seems to
 
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
be a narrower scope
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
1168 which doesn't
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
specify a specific Year date housing
 
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
crisis and the house version speaks to
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
the committee evaluating potential
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
remedies for increasing the supply of
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
housing that language is not in the
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
Senate bille so if you have any uh
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
information on those differences or if
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
the senator could get back to us about
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
that I think frankly I prefer the
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
language of the house bill okay I think
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
there were just differences in drafting
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
as the different sponsors put the bill
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
together they made slightly different
 
00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 align:start position:0%
choices uh in how it was worded I know
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
the um the suggestion for the bill came
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
from some of the same stakeholders and
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
then they just introduced it in the
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate
 
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
they went through the process and came
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
out slightly different ways um which way
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
is preferable that's policy decision and
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
I don't get a
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
vote thank
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%

stub

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%

hearing my testimony I will be extremely
 
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
brief um because you've heard me before
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and um I I just wanted to let you know
 
00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 align:start position:0%
that I support the um changes that were
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
made to my bill in the Senate and I
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
think having an extended time period
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
having an interim report for you know
 
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
low hanging fruit and then um a longer
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
study to determine some other ways that
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
we might increase the supply of
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing for people with
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
disabilities um I also just wanted to
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
share with you um The Gap report from
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
the national low-income housing
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
Coalition um it it
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
outlines um what the problem is um you
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
know for every hundred people that make
 
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
um 100% of median income um and need an
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
apartment there are 103 units um when
 
00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
you get down to 30% of median income
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
which are people that are on disability
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
or Social Security there are only 38
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
affordable units which means that they
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
would only have to pay um 30% of their
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
income for their housing there are only
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
38 units for every 100 people that need
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
them or 100 households that need them so
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
I just copied that off for you and um
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand it out and um does

the Senate Democratic caucus I am
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
introducing Senate Bill 527 on behalf of
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
senator suprus Senate Bill 527 is
 
00:15:33.389 --> 00:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
relative to student housing it includes
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
a student housing Municipal um a study
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
committee as well as a policy statement
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
as out of the Senate sen Apprentice um
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
is very regretful that she wasn't able
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
to be here today um basically
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
overarching concept on this bill and the
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
reason she brought it Forward was
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
because of the great need that our
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
communities have to find affordable
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
housing for students for Workforce the
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill as it stands has a policy statement
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
that has to make it that makes clear you
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
know the intent of a collaborative
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
nature between universities and
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities in terms of building a
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
housing housing stock that is diverse
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
and works for everyone involved um
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's also a study committee that has
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
duties to look at housing options for
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
students in those communities as well I
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
know that there is a non- derain hearing
 
00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:23.959 align:start position:0%
after this amendment Center Apprentice
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know certainly supports the Senate
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
position of the bill she has some
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
concerns of about the non- gerine
 
00:16:32.829 --> 00:16:32.839 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm sure she'd be happy to
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
about the underlying bill or the non-
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
germine amendment I'd be happy to take
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
those back to
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.470 align:start position:0%
her any questions for Jenny Morgan uh
representative

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
Walsh y thank you Mr chair um do you
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
know why I'm looking at the original um
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
527 do you know why section Roman 6 was
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
taken out and actually turned into the
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
study committee instead because actually
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
I like the look of section six in the
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
original Bill better than I like the non
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
gerain Amendment so I know that in the
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing the senator spoke to that
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
idea she did bring forward the amendment
 
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
that was a replace all just including
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
that original policy statement and a
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
study committee she heard a lot of
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
feedback and concerns about that
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement language and decided to move
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
forward with the bill as it currently
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
stands thank
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
questions represent Reed thank you and
 
00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for my question um has the
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
senator given information about where
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
she would stand on uh if the non-gain
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
amendment was in addition to a study
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee instead of replacing it I can
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
certainly take that back to her and have
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
her get back to the
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
committee um I just have a brief
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
question this is creating another study
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee to study like a solution to
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
the student housing problem in the state
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
but then the non-gain amendment is a
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
policy solution to deal with the student
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
housing problem in the state I guess I'm
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if the senator do we just want
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
to study it study it and study it or is
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
the senator infavor of like making
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
movements to actually solve the problem
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
I I think the senator as well as the
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
entire Senate is very invested in
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
finding actual solutions for problem but
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
as currently stands the study committee
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
is the Senate position on on the bill so
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
I can certainly take that back to her
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
but I would say that she supports the
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
bill as it currently stands okay I have
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of study committees come from
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate this year that's why I
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
ask sure of
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
course all right thank you very much
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you very much
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else here to testify on sp sp 527
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
amendment just the underlying
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so seeing none we are in

Hillsboro County District
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
36 to begin this amendment is largely
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
based upon House Bill
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
1281 relative to zoning restrictions on
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
residential rental property which has a
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan support in the house
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
and the Senate and it was filed upon the
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
request of a large group of concerned
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
citizens notably House Bill 1281 was
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
originally referred to this committee
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
but was vacated and assigned to
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government at the
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
behest of the chair of that committee
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
the bill then was strategic allowed to
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
be tabled in the house now this
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is straightforward Common
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
Sense legislation which simply prohibits
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities from enacting and
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
enforcing zoning ordinances related to
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
the occupancy of any single family
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
duplex or multifam dwelling based on
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
familial or non-familiar re
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
relationships or marital status among
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
the occupants or restricts the number of
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
occupants to less than two per
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
bedroom additionally this amendment is
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
the product of months of collaboration
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
with colleagues on both sides of the
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
aisle Municipal attorneys from across
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
the country housing Advocates and a
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
number of citizen groups here in the
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
state the New Hampshire youth movement
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the New Hampshire University
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Senate to a
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
few this legislation is needed in our
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
state because I have found that there
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
are at least eight
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities with zoning ordinances
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
that unreasonably limit the number of
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
unrelated people allowed to rent and
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
occupy a residential dwelling
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
unit in fact some municipalities
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily restrict the N this number
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
to no more than three unrelated people
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of the size and number of
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
bedrooms in the housing unit this is
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as the three
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule under this particular
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
type of ordinance it would be illegal
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
for four unrelated young professionals
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
students or even senior citizens to live
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
together in for example a four bedroom
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
rental unit whereas at the same time
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
a family of eight with two married
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
adults and six children would legally be
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
permitted to live in the same four
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
bedroom unit thus in this example one to
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
five housing opportunities are
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated by such unreasonable zoning
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances as we see in the three
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule in the midst of a housing
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
crisis zoning or ordinances like this
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
are highly problematic for a number of
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
reasons first and foremost overly
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
restrictive zoning ordinances are a
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
clear infringement by the government on
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
property rights of individuals to freely
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
utilize their private property property
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable and responsible manner
 
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
that does not pose any genuine health
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
and safety concerns furthermore I
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
contend that if the basis for such
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
ordinances are truly related to health
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
and safety then it would logically
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
follow that any occupancy restrictions
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
on residential housing should be equally
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
applied to all residential property
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
within the town significantly these
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
overly restrictive zoning ordinances
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
apply only to unrelated rental
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
households and not not to related
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
households even more problematic I found
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
that for example in the town of Durham
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
in which zoning ordinances restrict
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated households to no more than
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
three unrelated occupany occupants this
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
does not equally apply to all
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
residential rental properties in the
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
town as some properties are
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
grandfathered from this three unrelated
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
rule second over reaching zoning
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances that go beyond health and
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
safety negatively impact the
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
affordability and the supply of housing
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
in the granite state by arbitrarily
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
restricting the use of available housing
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
it is an indisputable fact that New
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently has an inadequate
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
supply of affordable housing and a
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
Severe shortage of rental housing in
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
general make no mistake restricting
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
zoning restrictive zoning ordinances
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
drive up rental costs and it reduces the
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
number of available housing units which
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
further comp compounds our housing
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
crisis third restrictive zoning
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
ordinances are unfair to say the very
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
least as a result of the three unrelated
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
rule I was told by a property owner that
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
he had been accused of racism and
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination towards four unrelated
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
black men who wanted to rent one of his
 
00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:34.599 align:start position:0%
properties to be clear the property in
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
question could have easily accommodated
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
these four men the men understandably
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
became very upset when the property
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
owner explained to them that he would be
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
unable to rent his property to these
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
four men due to a local zoning ordinance
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
that restricted the rental occupancy to
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
no more more than three unrelated
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
people because the men became became
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
upset because they knew of a house in
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
the very same town that was being rented
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
to eight unrelated Chinese restaurant
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
workers and fourth restrictive zoning
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
ordinances artificially limit housing
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people seeking
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
housing understand there are many
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for which unrelated individuals
 
00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
might seek to share housing for example
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
college students might want to share
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
housing to be able to afford the cost of
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%

00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
tuition working Professionals of all
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
ages might seek to share housing in
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
order to reduce expenses and to be able
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
to pay off their college loans others
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
find themselves in difficult
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances such as persons widowed
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
come to mind these groups of people may
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
choose or even need to share housing
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
costs and expenses in order to avoid
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness finally I will make one
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
last important Point New Hampshire is
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
not a home rule state it is a Dylan's
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
rule state therefore a new hampsh in New
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a local government's Authority
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
is derived only from the power granted
 
00:48:42.109 --> 00:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
to it by the state
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and importantly the power to
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
amend such local Authority is in fact
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
reserved and fully retained by the state
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
legislature as such under RS a 674 colon
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
16 municipalities have been granted the
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
power by the legislature to both adopt
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
and amend zoning ordinances for the
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
purpose of promoting health safety or
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
the general welfare of the community it
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
is clear that the power to adopt zoning
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances is being
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
unreasonably used by some municipalities
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
in a manner that blatantly is
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
overreaching and extends well beyond the
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
express objectives set forth in statute
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
as is evidenced by such zoning
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances as the three unrelated rule
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
therefore it is an incumbent upon our
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
state legislature to intervene on the
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
behalf of its
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
citizens and to amend the powers it has
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
granted to these municipalities
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
fittingly this amendment revises RSA 674
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
col Grant of power relative to zoning in
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
order to provide the appropriate guard
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
rails to local zoning powers granted by
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
the state legislature to
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities In Sum this amendment
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
upholds the inherent rights of property
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
owners guards against unfair practices
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
and unwarranted discrimination towards
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
unrelated people seeking housing and
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
helps to lower rental costs for granite
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
Staters by immediately increasing the
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
housing Supply when currently unused
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
housing is placed back onto the free
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
market therefore I urge this committee
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
to adopt this amendment and to
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
subsequently recommend Senate Bill 527
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended Mr chairman
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
that concludes my bill introduction I'm
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions however in
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
the interest of time I see there are a
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
number of people behind me so perhaps
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
questions could be tailored um to to the
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
people behind me
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
um um and I'd like to thank you for your
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
time and your consideration well thank
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
you but does anyone have a question
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
directly no okay representative Walsh
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
my question um I mean it's clear what
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
some of these ordinance are doing trying
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
to prevent frat houses in the middle of
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
their neighborhoods
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps in your your your examples some
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
of them may have gone too far or may
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
sound kind of
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable so if we adopt this
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I don't see any guard rails
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
in it to prevent 24 people from living
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
in a three-bedroom 26x 40 Ranch what do
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
you think is reasonable for the amount
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
of people living in a 2640 ranch with
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
three bedrooms so as a St stated in in
 
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.870 align:start position:0%
three bedrooms so as a St stated in in
the

00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
amendment I I have specified
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
that there's no local zoning ordinance
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
shall restrict the number of occupants
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
to to less than two per bedroom
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
depending upon the size of the bedroom
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
in question it is reasonable to be able
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
to house two people per bedroom now that
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
being said that would be you know up to
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
the landlord and the people
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
renting the both those groups those
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
parties may not be
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
interested in having two people per
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
bedroom but we want to be able to have
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
the flexibility and to be clear I'm not
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
interested in animal houses that that's
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
not what this amendment is is
 
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.030 align:start position:0%
not what this amendment is is
about

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
other when you get to to more I with
 
00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:02.799 align:start position:0%
regards to boarding
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
houses I honestly don't recall if that
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
threshold is four or five but at that at
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
that point then there
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
are codes building codes and fire codes
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
that that would apply and so I I would I
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
would contend that those are guard rails
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
to to to your concerns okay all yes
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chair um actually
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
the Animal House I'm glad you brought
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
that up because that's actually what the
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
ordinances are trying to prohibit so let
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
me ask you a question though uh because
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
I don't see a definition of bedroom
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
either so say you have a 26x 40 ranch
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
with three bedrooms uh is there anything
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
to prevent turning the dining room into
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
another bedroom and turning the den into
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
another bedroom in other words when does
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
this stop when there's a dozen 60 people
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
living in a house what could possibly go
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you representative I
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question so we we we we
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
know based on the assessment cards for a
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
particular property we can pull the
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
assessment card and we can
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
see you know the number of bedrooms so
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
that to me that would be a guide as to
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
how many bedrooms are are in a
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
property I'm not going to believe it you
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
can change anything you want
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else representative Reed
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony I find
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
it to be very compelling um in addition
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the points that you have very clearly
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
spelled out um do you think that if in
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
fact these uh local ordinances are meant
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
to address unsavory behavior in a
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
community for example that it makes more
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
sense to perhaps have ordinances to
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
address the actual behaviors for example
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
a noise ordinance and enforce those
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances rather than kind of
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily um limiting occupancy for
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
one type of Housing and I think maybe we
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
could get to the same place if we simply
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
said a municipality may not have an
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
ordinance that limits o occupancy on the
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
basis of whether a property is rental or
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
owned because you if you're going to
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
have an occupancy ordinance it should be
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
across the board but do you think that
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
it makes more sense to control the
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are unsavory rather than
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
than uh arbitrarily controlling
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
occupancy thank you for the question
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative that that's an excellent
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
point and I agree with um you know your
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
assertions clearly there are
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
ordinances on the books in
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities which deal with those
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
types of concerns with with you know
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
noise with parking with tracks
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
Etc what I have what has come to my
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
attention that restricting the number of
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
occupants to three that this three
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
unrelated rule is another attempt to
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
control those types of of concerns which
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
to me is highly inappropriate and it
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense because it's
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
infringing upon property rights of
 
00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:27.789 align:start position:0%
infringing upon property rights of
individuals

00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
a municipality doesn't have the right to
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
that the constitution provides for
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
property owners to be able to utilize
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
and enjoy their property in a
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
manner that that's that's reasonable and
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have adopted such
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances are those ordinances are
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
overreaching and they infringe
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
um upon those rights and it's
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and like I've St stated
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
that when when we see this happening
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon the New Hampshire
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
General Court to to step in and and to
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
situation followup thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you again um in addition do
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
you think that uh it's possible to
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
interpret some of these ordinances that
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
restrict on the basis of related status
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
um in addition to all of the
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
Discrimination you've already kind of
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
put out that it could be a kind of like
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
moral legislating on the part of the the
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
town for example you know it's fine for
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
you to live in the same bedroom if you
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
are married but if you are simply dating
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want you in the same bedroom
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative yes that you know that
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
that that that that could be the case in
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
in some instances for these types of uh
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
for these types of ordinances and in
 
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.230 align:start position:0%
for these types of ordinances and in
fact

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
um in my work on this bill I I have in
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
fact um learned of a situation where to
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
unmarried individuals who were in a
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
relationship were denied the opportunity
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
to rent housing for the very fact that
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
unmarried okay anyone else Mr chair
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
boarding houses and were you referring
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
to roing
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
houses um thank you for the question um
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes yeah because rooming houses
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
um the single room that the person lives
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
in is their that's their domicile and
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
they have a locking key so it isn't like
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
because there are 10 rooms you know
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
rented in a rooming house that that's
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
over overly over occupied so it's one
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
person per unit or two people per unit
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
whatever this would not apply to that to
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
to those um types of of residences okay
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay that it okay thank you
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and committee members
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony I'm Al Holland I
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
represent straford 20 which is Durham
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
Lee Madbury in a sliver of Dover um I've
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
spent uh in from 2016 to 22 on the
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
Durham Town Council and I'm currently on
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
the Durham uh advisory housing task
 
00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039 align:start position:0%
force where we used invest New Hampshire
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
money to do a housing needs assessment
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
of our community um so as uh this
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
similar Amendment came through the
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
municipal County uh committee there was
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
one community that was really talked
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
about almost exclusively and that was
 
01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
Durham and Durham is unusual uh in the
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
fact that I I did demographically in the
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
State uh 18 to 24 year olds make up
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
about 99.1% of the population in Durham
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
66% which really speaks to what we are
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
which is a college community and it's
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
let me just say even despite what the
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
testimony was in Municipal County it's a
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
great place to live um our issue really
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
has been that UNH does not provide
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
enough housing for their students and we
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
currently house about
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
4,54 students in off-campus
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
complexes and the difficulty that we
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
really had came about from uh non-owner
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
occupied single family units that had
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
been bought by investors and used to
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
student housing and we had real
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
difficulties uh as investors came in and
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
these became nuisance houses uh I think
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
it was referred why don't we address
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
what we do of course we have noise
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances we have trash ordinances we
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
have a community policing officer that
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
came in but it takes an extraordinary
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
long time as you work through the fine
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
system and finally the court system to
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
deal with it and the neighbors suffer
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so what Durham did is uh we in fact
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
changed our zoning and it was actually
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
more liberal than the amendment asks for
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
and and I think the question was raised
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable in State Fire code
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's 200 square foot per occupant you
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
don't use bedroom because as was
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned you can get pretty creative
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
when you try to think about what a
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
bedroom is and so what we did is we
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
picked a zone that was best suited for
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
student housing right around the campus
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
and we gave great density bonus which
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
was 300t per occupant no related unrel
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
involved just per occupant and we built
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
2,000 units of student housing and it's
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
worked really really well it's close to
 
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
campus they're well-managed and we've
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
had very little problems with it
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
additionally in the collar uh zones
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
around it which was single family
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
housing we loosened the requirements for
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh adus and really made it uh um
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
enticing for homeowners to build adus
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
and we have 250 adus were built and
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
we've had absolutely no problems with
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
those the problems really have resided
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
still in those single family houses and
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify student housing
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
differs from regular rental housing by
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
the lease in the lease of a student
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
house uh it's uh less than a year which
 
01:02:46.109 --> 01:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
kind of follows the academic calendar
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
which is what you see in dorms the
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
second thing is it's priced per occupant
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
so the idea that you would take a
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom and share it uh that doesn't
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
happen in any occupant is has a separate
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
lease and they're paying uh to the
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
landlord so if you have a house and you
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
put eight people in it all eight people
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
are paying to the landlord on a separate
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
lease and what we found in our housing
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
needs assessment is that actually drives
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
up the overall cost of the apartment and
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's boxing out both graduate students
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
who cannot afford the cost that
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
undergraduates can and our Workforce uh
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the three unrelated which
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
we did put in single family homes that
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
border that area it was not arbitrary in
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
fact that's based on fire code and so
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
when you look in the definition of fire
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
code when you move from three to four
 
01:03:42.029 --> 01:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
unrelated and that's four to up to 16
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
and they share a kitchen it is no longer
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
classified as a single family home it is
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
classified as a lodging house and that
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
changes the fire code requirement of it
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh and there by the way in fire code the
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated and related is embedded in our
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
fire code what the fire code says is
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
that related people believe it or not
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
are more likely to care for each other
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and so it lowers the overall fire risk
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
unrelated don't and so therefore there's
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
a higher requirement that's built into
 
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
fire code to address that you guys
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
change the legislation so that address
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
the sprinkler but it in the chapter 26
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the fire code there's a a greater
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
requirement for egress in that 4 to 16
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
lodging house and so as a community in
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
Ence what we said the three unrelated is
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
saying we as a community do not want
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
lodging houses to reside in our single
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
family uh our residential zones and and
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the the logic before it and it
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
seems to have worked really really well
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
I would also point out though uh we're
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
not the only college town in New
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Handover has also addressed
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
this similar issue particularly with
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
student leases and so what they did is
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
instead of doing the three unrelated
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
they broaden the definition of unrelated
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
which I have recommended by the way to
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
Durham uh by broadening the definition
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
of unrelated what they were really
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to strip off students
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
and particularly that student leasing uh
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
structure that really boxes out the the
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
identified groups that we really wanted
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
and not allowing that in certain areas
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
so we're we're zoning to put students in
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
and again we've put over 2,000 in and
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
having areas that really aren't the
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
prime area for students for residents
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
and Workforce outside of that
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
additionally what we've been working on
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
with new zoning uh uh is to try to do
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce overlay districts the
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
workforce overlay districts what we'll
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
do is we'll give density bonuses to do
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing in perpetuity uh our
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
housing assessment need identified zones
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
that are on Water and Sewer public water
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
and sewer and those are R to build more
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
Apartments uh the apartments that really
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
are better designed to deal with uh both
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
graduate students and our Workforce and
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think that was a lot of information to
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
throw pretty quick and I I hope I didn't
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
take too much time and and I'm open to
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
any questions okay any questions
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you said that you are
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
representing yourself and obviously your
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
district and not necessarily the Town
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
Council but I I have a question that I'm
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
hoping you'll be able to answer as your
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
experience on on the Town Council um so
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
from what I'm reading and perhaps this
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
is something that's already been changed
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
I'm reading something old but in your uh
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance you have under number four for
 
01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.630 align:start position:0%
ordinance you have under number four for
accessory

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
accessory
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
Apartments um an ordinance that
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
says uh in zoning districts where no
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
more than three unrelated persons May
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
occupy a dwelling unit there shall be no
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
more than three unrelated occup in total
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
for the single family dwelling unit and
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
an accessory dwelling unit combined or
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the single family dwelling and the
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
accessory apartment combined and um my
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
question is uh don't you feel that it
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
that conflicts directly I don't know if
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
the towns actually enforced that in
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
terms of three unrelated for an entire
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
property including the Adu and as you
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm very fond of adus and I
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
actually worked with your town Planner
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
on the Adu bill so I appreciate that and
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
I appreciate uh y'all's work in that in
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the town on that but in existing law and
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
not my bill it actually says that the
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
municipality may not require familial
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
relationship between the occupants of an
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit and the
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
occupancy of the principal dwelling unit
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
which as my understanding of
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
interpreting the existing law as I just
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
read it and your ordinance would mean
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
that if you had enforced that ordinance
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
that would have been an illegal
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement of that ordinance because
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
the state does not allow a town to
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
require an occupancy uh a relationship
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
between the occupancy between the the
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
primary unit and the dwelling the
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit so are you
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with this conflict or has it
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
been enforced or is this changed already
 
01:08:08.109 --> 01:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
um so that's a good question thank you
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
for asking it so uh to start off with
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
all the adus that we've had currently
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
are relatively small so putting three
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
occupants in would be a challenge this
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
question was asked of me though the way
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
if this goes through first of all the
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
Adu has not been signed by the governor
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
yet but if it did go through
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
um my reading of it would be that the
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
state uh the state would take precedence
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
and so uh the three unrelated would only
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
uh relate to each individual unit so the
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
Adu would have three unrelated the uh
 
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
primary uh residents theoretically could
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
have uh only three unrelated and again
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
that would only relate to single family
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
homes follow up follow up so I don't
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
know if I miscommunicated the the the
 
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
the section of law I read is not the
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
bill this is existing statute existing
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
statute prohibits a town from requiring
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
a familial relationship between the
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
owners the occupiers of the primary and
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Adu your ordinance as I currently
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
read it unless it's been changed and I
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
am not aware says that you can require
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
in essence through your three unrelated
 
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh occupancy rule you can require a
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
familial relationship essentially and so
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
my qu so just to be clear it's not a
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
matter of the Adu is going to be signed
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
or Not by the governor it is a matter of
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
current existing law and has Durham
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
broken the law by enforcing this
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
particular ordinance I'll give you a
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
simple answer no we have not it has
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
never been enforced okay representative
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh with your
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
permission Mr chair I have three
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
questions and I'll ask them one at a
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
time sure go ahead thank you uh okay um
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
my questions have to do with your
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh are also based on
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
personal experience from having lived
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
for five years in a neighborhood of
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn Massachusetts that was about
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
half students uh and have families um
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that uh UNH doesn't
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
provide um uh enough housing for its
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
students which I'm sure is is uh uh
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly possible
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
um but even if UNH provided all the
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
housing that could reasonably be
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
expected wouldn't there still be some
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
students who prefer to live in rental
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
apartments so wouldn't that issue still
 
01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
apartments so wouldn't that issue still
come

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
up uh so that's a good question actually
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
the the group that really wanted to live
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
off campus is graduate students because
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh the problem that the university has
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
is that Oyster River is a cooperative
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
district and so if a family of graduate
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
students lives on campus they have to
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
pay tuition to go into to Oyster River
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
School District and so uh the university
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
really believe me it really was and so
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
that it was really there was pressure on
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
the University because at one point they
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
were paying like $80,000 a year to the
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
school district for tuition and so the
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
University's response to that was to
 
01:11:24.189 --> 01:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
tear down the graduate student housing
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
and to push them off campus and so there
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
clearly is a need for graduate student
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
housing uh in unh's expansion plans it's
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
all rests upon expanding their graduate
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
programs particularly their research
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
facilities but they haven't provided any
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
housing for them and as I said the uh
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
per unit rental model drives up the cost
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
and it boxes out those very students my
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
next question addresses that very
 
01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
subject um and again I speak here from
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
personal experience
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
um the way it worked in the neighborhood
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
I lived in was that each apartment had
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
its own lease not each room not each
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
person each apartment and the leases ran
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
from September 1st through August 30th
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
so they were yearly leases not school
 
01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
so they were yearly leases not school
year

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
leases and uh the way it worked was um
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
one person in the apartment held the
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
lease and everybody else uh the other
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
three or four people however many it was
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh paid rent to the person who held the
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
lease who paid the rent to the landlord
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't that also be done in say Duram
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that solve some of the
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
problems of RA raising up the cost and
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
having uh this odd school year lease
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
issue so yes that that would solve the
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
problem the difficulty is that as
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
municipality we don't have the ability
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
to enforce a lease agreement between a
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
tenant and and a building owner and so
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
the CR as I said the Crux of the real
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
problem that we're having is the leas
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
structure of that undergraduate housing
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
um and and we really are trying to work
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
around it ironically enough is we looked
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
at the workforce zones that we want to
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
build one of the groups that we've
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
identified that we really want are
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers and so uh UNH
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
students particularly those that have
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
lnas or LPN that are working their way
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
through uh the there's developers that
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
really want to build housing for them
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
because they need them to expand their
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
medical services and so what they do is
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
like they have a work requirement if
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
you're working for them that even
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of what any other thing
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's what really gets you into the
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
housing so the leasing really is as you
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Crux of the issue and has
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
the town uh has a town Administration
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
considered working with landlords to
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
change the lease structure to something
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
closer to a standard lease structure
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
that as you said would solve some of the
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
problems well of course it's investors
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that are buying in and changing that
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
lease structure of course uh reduces the
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
return that the investor gets on his
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
property and so they really do not want
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
to do that actually we had a discussion
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
on the housing task force there is a
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
member of uh of a large rental complex
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
and uh believe it or not with declining
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
enrollment there has been an a softening
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the rent student rental market and so
 
01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
the question is how do you convert those
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
right along your lease line how do you
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
convert those units back from the per
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
bed model to a traditional model to
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
actually capture again Workforce and
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
graduate student housing and so we don't
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
have a great answer to that yet uh last
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
question um uh you referred to problems
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
of noise and so forth with with student
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
housing uh and here again I speak from
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
personal experience um uh I'll just be
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
real real brief um the noise problem
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
where I lived did not come from any
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
students it came excuse the expression
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
from unhappy marriages we heard them
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
yelling at each other all night long so
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
my question is aren't there other noise
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
problems and other trash problems that
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
are not caused by
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
students for sure but not to the extent
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
of students uh I mean I I I I do not
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
want to sit here and Bash students
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
because they are a great part of Durham
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
and they make us what is special it's
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
really alcohol mixed with students that
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
creates a great deal of problems and uh
 
01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
that demographic particularly is where
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
the issue lies um and that's why we also
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
implemented a community police officer
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
that when I mean again our our police
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
chief said you're not going to arrest
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
your way out of the problem and I think
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's we strongly believe we don't want
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
to harm people that are coming to our
 
01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
community before they have a chance to
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
fully grow up and so uh the community
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
police officer what they do is the day
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
after they come they talk to the
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
students and work with them and again
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
the large complexes that are
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
well-managed along with the adus we've
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
had really no problems they've worked
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
out really well thank you representative
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair um earlier
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
you referenced nuisance housing can you
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
talk to me a little bit about what you
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
mean by nuisance housing uh well was
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
right along this noise uh that you know
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh some houses run on a
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
different time schedule that families do
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so when it's like 1 or two o'clock
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
in the morning and you have a stereo
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
blasting that's the noise problem trash
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
I would welcome any of you to come to
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
Durham on a Sunday morning and take a
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
actually take a ride along with our
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
police on like a Friday or Saturday
 
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
night or come around Saturday morning
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
and look and you'll see there's like
 
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
beer cans strewn everywhere and a lot of
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
those uh those houses s are sitting
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
right next to a middle school so it
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
disrupts our Middle School um so I mean
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
that those are the two things that we
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
really have faced repeatedly and I can
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
follow up how long has UNH been a
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
school uh you know I I probably should
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
have that by heart at least 100 years
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so any family that decided to
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
purchase a a home near a school
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
understands that with the school comes
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
students I guess I'm confused with like
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
the property owner purchased the
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
property near the school they had to
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
know that that was one of the reasons or
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
one of the nuisances of buying a
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
property near school right for sure I
 
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
mean obviously when you move to Durham
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's a college campus but we as
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
a municipality don't say I'm sorry
 
01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
you're out of luck the whole point of
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
like zoning is that you're supposed to
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
try to address issues that are occurring
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
and so what we tried to do is resolve it
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
by putting and by the way the other
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
thing that's lost in there is not just
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
nuisances it's student safety when you
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
mix alcohol and students there can be
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
some very serious cons consequences that
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
come along with it and so by putting
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
students in a more appropriate place
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
that are better supervised it it it
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
really is to the safety element of the
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
students and so again just saying I'm
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
sorry we didn't know that your property
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
would flood or that you'd have students
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
and and you're out of luck is generally
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
not the way that we try to work as a
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipality okay representative
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
helping us understand this um I have two
 
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions so first of all you spoke
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
about I believe Handover having a
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
broader definition of unrelated so what
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
is the definition of unrelated and or
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
what are the different
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
definitions so I I I'll have to have
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
send you the actual definitions but the
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
large part was it worked in the lease it
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
they somebody was there like you know um
 
01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
12 months not 11 months and then again I
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't remember the the particulars but
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
in essence what it was doing was
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
stripping off that students from non-
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
students it's a little vague but I I I
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
mean again I I have to come back it
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
would be great if you could send it
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and second question um so
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
this is a completely different
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
question I was puzzled by your statement
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
about Oyster River Cooperative School
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
District which is a public school
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
district charging residents of a
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
community in the District tuition do I
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
have that right you do have that right
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
so since it is a the the the issue is if
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
you live on University property the
 
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
university does not pay property taxes
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and since we're a
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
Cooperative we cannot say you know what
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to let this fly because Lee
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
and madbear would say well that's not
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
fair in the apportionment of the
 
01:19:50.629 --> 01:19:50.639 align:start position:0%
students so so as a result that if you
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
live on private uh University property
 
01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
the University is responsible for the
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
tuition clarification oh so just to
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
clarify or extend my understanding of
 
01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
clarify or extend my understanding of
that

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
so employees or grad students or whoever
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
living on the UNH property who have
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
school age
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
children access public school because
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
the State University pays the tuition
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
and otherwise they wouldn't have access
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
to public school they would if they
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
lived off campus but if they live on
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
don't we learn something every
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
day okay uh representative Reed thank
 
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chair and thank you again
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I also by the way
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
um not related to my question directly
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
would like the definition of unrelated
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
because I was wondering the same thing
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking well really aren't we
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
all related in in some way so uh our
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
larger family of man and I'm I'm I'm
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
interested in how that is defined but my
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
question is um and it's kind of a
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
two-fold question in my it's what is the
 
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.990 align:start position:0%
two-fold question in my it's what is the
difference

01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
between because as I hear you saying you
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to disparage students I'm
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
also hearing how all of these ordinances
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
are very tailored towards students and
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
restricting students and students are
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
the problem and students have worse
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
behavior and we're worried about student
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior whether it's you know you're
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get around the lease terms to
 
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
directly you know deal with the fact
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
that they are students or the you know
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
are they related to deal with the fact
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
that their students is all by admission
 
01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
very much geared towards students that
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
demographic and so my question is what's
 
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
the difference between singling out that
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
demographic and singling out any other
 
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
demographic that might statistically
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
have different behaviors broadly
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
speaking for example what's the
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
difference between saying well we want
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
to Target students because they have
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
problematic behavior and we want to
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
Target a particular religion or a
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
particular ethnicity because they have
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
certain cultural behaviors because to me
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds a little cringe if you forgive
 
01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
the expression that we are admitting
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we want to Target students a
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
particular demographic so what's the
 
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
difference so I I did mention that we
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
University Town right so uh so in a in a
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
University Town what if you ask students
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
where do you want to live
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
they want to live close to campus and so
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh again in terms of targeting students
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
we we built 2,000 units of student
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
housing we built the housing where
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
students wanted where best fit the
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
students and so uh that o we what we're
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do the idea is open up other
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
housing to the groups that we've
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
identified that couldn't get housing
 
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of ethnicity sex or anything
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
else you would put in there what we
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
really defining it it as is workers
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
graduate students people that could not
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
afford that per bed unit and so in
 
01:23:02.669 --> 01:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
instead of like in saying that we're
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
targeting students or that we're trying
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
to uh you know hold off on that that is
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
actually the data doesn't show that that
 
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
is why we did build housing we built it
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
where it really fit where it worked with
 
01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:15.350 align:start position:0%
where it really fit where it worked with
the

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
university follow up thank you and I I
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't um at all uh casting aspersions I
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
was using your own words when you were
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
trying to explain what related meant you
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
said specifically you were trying to aim
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
at students in the ordinance that's what
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
you had said so that's why I repeated
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
that um my second part of this what is
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
the difference question is if you buy a
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
house as was mentioned uh in a student
 
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
town in a University Town you know that
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're buying a property and there's
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
students around that's going to be a
 
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
tradeoff what are the benefits to living
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
near a college and there are many
 
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
benefits to living near a college what
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
are the the the the con side how is that
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
different than buying anywhere else if I
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
buy a house in a rural area the pro is
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful rural area the con is I
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
might have to commute further there may
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
not be as many services available to me
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
etc etc if I buy in a city just the
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
opposite the pro is I have lots of
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
services public transit you name it but
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
there may not be as uh much space so
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
what is the difference between accepting
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
the tradeoff and buying a different area
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
wherever you're going there's a
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
trade-off and buying in a university
 
01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's a tradeoff you know the trade-off
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
when you buy that property what's the
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
difference so the difference is that uh
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's more difficult to buy a house where
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
we are because an investor will box you
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
out since the investor can rent per B
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
per occupant uh they're able to get a
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
really high return on it and so they'll
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
pay cash and you'll have difficulty
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
buying that house and so what we've seen
 
01:24:53.229 --> 01:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
is investors have been buying up all the
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
single family houses that sit on the uh
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
the border of the university and that
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
really boxes out most homeowners from
 
01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
buying them yeah well that's
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
all um and I do appreciate what you just
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
brought up because uh and this is very
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
broadly on on the housing issue in
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
general my point has been while we do
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
need to deal with Supply very
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
desperately um Supply Is Not the Only
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Solution here because it Durham is my
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
example exle where it's been built it
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't necessarily brought down costs
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
Supply alone does not fix the problem
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
and I think you pinpointed a large other
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
piece of the problem which is investors
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
and what they have done in terms of
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
buying up housing so my question is does
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
it not make a lot more sense to Target
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
that behavior investor Behavior large
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
corporate landlord Behavior rather than
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
penalize the students by saying that
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
they can't live in a bedroom with their
 
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
they can't live in a bedroom with their
whoever

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so that's
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
the beauty of the workforce uh overlay
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
District uh we can use density when when
 
01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
an investor comes to us and we have an
 
01:26:06.109 --> 01:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
investor that's really interested in a
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
117 acre parcel that would give us over
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
200 units and we can say to the investor
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
you know what we'll give you greater
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
density we'll push down that per
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
occupant square footage but in tradeoff
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask for a percentage to
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
be in Workforce for perpetuity and
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
that's better even than the invest New
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire money that came in which is
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
only five years which is too short and
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
so the workforce opportunity clause in
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
79e is about 30% that it pushes in this
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
we're actually trying to go much higher
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
so so to deal with investers again uh
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to use uh the carrot rather
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
than stick I guess is the approach okay
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh I guess this is is
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
really a follow follow up to one of my
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
earlier questions um and I have to admit
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
here that in spite of actually being a
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm not sure how this would work
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
legally uh but it it occurs to me that
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
if you are able to control the number of
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
unrelated people living in a unit um
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
might it not be possible to control
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
something about the way leases work that
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
is that control how the lease would work
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
and the lease being per unit rather than
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
per bedroom or per occupant and that
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
again as you mentioned earlier might
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
solve a lot of your problems um well
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question uh so again the
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the way that you're able to control
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
the occupancy really is by the
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
definition so uh four to 16 that are
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
unrelated that are sharing a kitchen
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
aren't it's not a single family house
 
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
anymore by definition in your zoning
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
table it becomes a lodging house and so
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're able to control occupancy because
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
we can able to control what we allow in
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
certain zones the least I I have to say
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer so I cannot speak to
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
that okay well thank you very much uh
 
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
housing thank you Mr chairman good
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
morning committee members I'm Ben Frost
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy director and chief legal
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
officer at New Hampshire housing I'm
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
here in uh to speak in support of the
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 1482 to Senate Bill
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
527 there's been an awful lot U said
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
about this bill I so I'll just make a
 
01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
few additional points
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a question of means of
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
addressing an
 
01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.750 align:start position:0%
addressing an
issue

01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
and I would submit to you that the way
 
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
that uh some communities are attempting
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
to address this issue is potentially
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and probably uh uh
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
definitely a violation of state law
 
01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:07.629 align:start position:0%
definitely a violation of state law
against

01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh and I speak in
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
particular uh with regard to the
 
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
questions of familial status and marital
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
status um RSA 150 RSA
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
354a uh which is the states uh
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law addresses these
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
two issues and as well as a variety of
 
01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
other classes of of peoples who are
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
protected against discrimination but it
 
01:29:36.669 --> 01:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
says that um there shall be no
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of familial
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
status or marital status and these words
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
um are either indirectly or directly
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
referred to in the amendment on line 15
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
um familial or non-familial
 
01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
relationships marital stat stat uh it in
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
my view it is not the business of the
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
government including
 
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to decide who should be
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
occupying a
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
bedroom whether they're unrelated or
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
married that is A Private
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
Matter uh when it comes to
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination there are exceptions so
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are bases for the government to
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
act in a discriminatory fashion if in
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
these cases where you have these
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
protected classes if there is a
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
and there is not a less restrictive
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
means possible so maybe there is a
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
compelling governmental interest here uh
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's the safety of uh the
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
occupants of the structure or something
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
to do with the
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood uh but there is most
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a less intrusive means
 
01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.709 align:start position:0%
certainly a less intrusive means
possible

01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
and I think it has already been clearly
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
articulated here this morning that is
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the fire code the fire
 
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
code the state fire code RSA 153
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
addresses occupancy IT addresses how
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
much space people need to safely occupy
 
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
a dwelling
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
unit and if these towns that have this
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
concern would just do
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
that then I think they would find that
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
questions of overcrowding would be
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
addressed certainly they also have other
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
means to address the other issues waste
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
noise and I know that they are difficult
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
to enforce but that does not mean that
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of enforcement of those
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
measures does not entitle them to engage
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
in unlawful
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination under state law and
 
01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.430 align:start position:0%
discrimination under state law and
federal

01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
law I'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.270 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
well we do have a question
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
here thank you uh Mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um the
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances in um darm have they ever
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
been tested um around this
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
issue yes represent V Lorenzo I believe
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
that the Durham ordinance or at least an
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
earlier iteration of the Durham
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
ordinance was tested I think there was a
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
1975 case where uh I think it was
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
Superior Court found that the the
 
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
language that Durham was using uh
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
unrelated individuals and the standards
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
were different at that time in the
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance uh did not afford
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
protection to the challengers uh because
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
they were resting on the F the the
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
familial status uh um protection and
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
they were not a family under under law
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
so they didn't get that protection this
 
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
language is much clearer uh in this
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it refers to familial
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
or non-familiar relationships and
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
marital status so um and I think it was
 
01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
a representative power who gave a couple
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
of really great illustrative
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
examples um you know two unmarried
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
couples cannot live together in the same
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
apartment in
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
related uh followup so um um when I
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
think about um Family status um as per
 
01:33:32.109 --> 01:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
HUD it's a family is a group of people
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
that want to live together to um you
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
know cohabit and and that's it it
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about um you know
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
relationships so I'm I'm sort of like
 
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
drawing that as an analogy um to what I
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
feel um should be the LIE thank you I
 
01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:55.109 align:start position:0%
feel um should be the LIE thank you I
agree

01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
agree
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay um Mr Frost what town do you live
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
in I live in the Town of Warner Warner
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
okay are you aware when you purchase the
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
prop do you own a property I do are you
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
aware that there's a college near Warner
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that you might have students living
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
near you there there was a college in
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
Warner it closed recently um and I'm I'm
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
I was certainly aware of it yes thank
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I I hesitate to uh
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
appear to contradict you on this um but
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
it happens to be an issue that um I'm
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
particularly familiar with and that
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
involves the definition of familial
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
status um uh under both state and
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
um and that is uh familial status I'm
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
looking here at the text of RSA
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
354a I have it here too representative
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
sorry I have I have it here too
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
representative um and it refers to
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
individuals who have not attained the
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
age of 18 who have not attained the age
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
of 18 years of age domiciled with a
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
parent grandparent or another person
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
having legal custody and it goes on uh
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
to cover someone who is pregnant or in
 
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:15.159 align:start position:0%
the process of of obtaining legal
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
custody um the point being that it
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
refers to uh families with children
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
rather than General familial status uh
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
the status of being unrelated now state
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
law also covers marital status which
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
federal law does that does not um so
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
that gives you a little more of a handle
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
there under state law but I just thought
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
it was important to point that out
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
representative gives a a agree with you
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
completely and I I had have read that
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
definition in RSA 354a and that's why I
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
think the inclusion of the term marital
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
status on line 15 is very important
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's it thank you um
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.149 --> 01:36:09.159 align:start position:0%

housing action New Hampshire are on the
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
front lines of this crisis they are
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
trying to problem solve this um they are
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
the developers they are the financers of
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
affordable housing properties they're
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Supportive Housing providers for
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
those uh uh those who need services in
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
addition uh to their housing um and they
 
01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
are using every tool available that the
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
state makes available that
 
01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities may make available to
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
solve this crisis when they are hitting
 
01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:48.109 align:start position:0%
solve this crisis when they are hitting
a

01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
barrier where are they supposed to go
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to go to the lawmakers
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
to ask them for Relief to say thank you
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
for these tools however we are still
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
unable to provide this housing uh and so
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
are they are asking um for uh for you to
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
improve the law um so that they can help
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
solve a very serious crisis we view this
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
amendment as one of those places where
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's important to come to State
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
lawmakers in particular and while um the
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
efforts at many municip IES including
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
some of them mentioned today have been
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
impressive and a real commitment to
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
addressing the crisis there are still
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
places where there remains bias and
 
01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
barriers in need of a state lawmaker
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and support and so um with that
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
we ask you to consider um making an
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
important step in this direction and
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
passing this of recommending it for
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
passage I do want to also name something
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
about home share for people aging or
 
01:38:55.149 --> 01:38:55.159 align:start position:0%
desire iring to age in place New
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not yet have a strong
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
home share program and in many times
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's because they're battling local
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances like this one they would like
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
to create um programs where um people
 
01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
who are unrelated could help an aging
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
person stay in their home um and there
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
are examples in other states where this
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
has been successful our attempts yet New
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um are kind of non-starters
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
and I think that passing this would be
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
important foundationally for helping us
 
01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh launch some of these home share
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
programs in the state and with that I'll
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
conclude okay thank you any
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
none

01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%

gerain Amendment um I do want to note
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
because I know some of you also serve on
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal County government and that
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
when the original bill um House Bill
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
1281 came up we did not have a position
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
on that bill however we were provided
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
further information from affected
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
communities including Durham who who
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard about extensively today um
 
01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
as well as Lebanon and Handover all of
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
whom have submitted written testimony as
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
well and as a result we uh uh we are
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
opposing this non-main amendment um I do
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
want to note that I am not familiar with
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
the particularities of Durham's zoning
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
ordinance or how that interacts with
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
state law I am aware that the town
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
planner is sitting behind me waiting to
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
testify so I would ask to defer
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions to him if you have those
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
specific questions um I just want to
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
note um that you know this this is this
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
would be a Statewide mandate that would
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
that would overrule the decisions of uh
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
local communities you've heard
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
extensively uh from Durham about how
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
they have attempted to um balance the
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
interests of various parties within
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
their Community um I understand that not
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
everyone agrees with how they've chosen
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
to do that um but it is important and I
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
think that the very extensive testimony
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
illustrates that these are very
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
complicated issues um that don't have a
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
single solution um that obviously
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
require a lot of input uh a lot of
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
thought and Durham has clearly done that
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
um as a result they have created a uh a
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
series of
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances um that interact that attempt
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
to balance the interests of of who needs
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
housing in their Community promote
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
housing in a way that uh allows kind of
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
equity across the board um and that's
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in other communities um
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
with other uh with other definitions and
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
other um variations of this
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's exactly what we're
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
talking about when we're talking about
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
um you know uh non non-permanent uh type
 
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
of housing as for students um and so
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's really more appropriate to
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
deal with that at the local level as
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
they can tailor that to kind of the
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
needs of the individual communities both
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
the res both the permanent residents
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
coming forward as well as the colleges
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
universities other um student based uh
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
entities and uh and talk about what will
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
work what can be supported by those
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
entities as well as what's needed from
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
the community and have that free flow of
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
information rather than putting in place
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
a Statewide mandate that is going to
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
force um significant changes uh to a
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
number of communities across the state
 
01:42:43.629 --> 01:42:43.639 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that the
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
ghouls we have your written testimony
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
here thank you I may digress a little
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
bit just listening to some oppos a bill
 
01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
to other testimony but uh thank you for
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
listening to me members of the
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is jayg I've lived
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
in Durham since
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
1978 uh actually 77 but I live in the
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
same street since 1978 and it is is very
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
close to proximity to everything with
 
01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.229 align:start position:0%
close to proximity to everything with
the

01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
university uh I walked downtown now I
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
took a two-mile walk all around the
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
campus this morning so I'm very familiar
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
with being close to the campus I was a
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer physician for the hockey team
 
01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
for 40 years uh retired a few years ago
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
from that and
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
I have very good friends who were
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
students some of them still contact me
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
after all these years so I'm a fan of
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I am test testifying today
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the amendment that was
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
added to Senate Bill 527 concerning a
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
minimum of two renters per bedroom this
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I do not believe is an
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
effective way to deal with New
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's affordable housing problem
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm really hoping at the end of my
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
testimony you'll take into consideration
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we are trying and Durham to address
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
this issue and to do it this way would
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
tremendously impact and I'll explain why
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
Durham by the will of the people placed
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable constraints on the number of
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
renters in our single family homes when
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
I first moved to Durham many single
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
family homes were owned by faculty of
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
the university and the local school
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
system because it was affordable to buy
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
and live in those houses shortly after
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
my family moved here investors found
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
that buying houses and renting to as
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
many University students as possible
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
provided an excellent return on their
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
investment especially if the investor
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
minimized maintenance and upkeep
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
expenses soon home afford home
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
affordability for families began to
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
disappear as the landlord's renting by
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
the bed could outbid families for the
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
properties once a house in the
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood became a
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
student rental now I can use this term
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
student rental I was involved with
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
drafting the ordinance in 1986 for the
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
three unrelated and I was very
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
specifically told by attorneys don't say
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
student you've got to make it general
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
for unrelated because you can't
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
discriminate against students so I'm a
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
little bit confused about seeing this
 
01:45:40.589 --> 01:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
amendment which
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
specifically targets
 
01:45:44.119 --> 01:45:47.109 align:start position:0%
specifically targets
students

01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
so for years we were told we could uh
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
could not say students but it resulted
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
than parties cars noise and trash issues
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
that ensued after these homes were
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
bought by these investors one of the
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
many and I'm going to get personal one
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
of the many examples of this was when
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
the house across from us was rented to
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
five students while my daughter was
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
recovering from major lung
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
surgery constant noise related to the
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
lifestyle of students ensued calling the
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
police for ongoing problems of drunken
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
shouting and car door slamming at one
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
123 am did not help as often the issue
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
ended before the police arrived leaving
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
my daughter and US Disturbed throughout
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
the night other residents our
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhood were dealing with drunk
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
students trespassing near their house
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
while shouting urinating and worse again
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
calling the police did no good because
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
try as they might to be
 
01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
helpful the perpetrators had moved on
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
once the house across from us was deemed
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
to fall under under our ordinance it has
 
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
been occupied with one owner or a family
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the main house and one to two
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
students or a family in the Adu there
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
have been no problems with this
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
Arrangement students living in Durham
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
for two to three years do not have the
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
same behavior or lifestyle of working or
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
retired full-time
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
residents when I was on Our Town Council
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
I served on the Regional Housing
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
Commission that met in Portsmouth over
 
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
the course of two to three years no
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
matter what plan we came up with the
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
answer for Durham was always the same
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
investors could outbid families for
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
homes because of their ability to rent
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
by the bed at the higher Market rates
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
driven by the
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
university while committed to our
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
families and neighborhoods Durham has
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
been equally committed to increasing
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
housing for our student residents over
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
the past 15 years our zoning and
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
planning processes have allowed the
 
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
number of student residents to increase
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
over 130% by adding new well- managed
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
departments that can accommodate almost
 
01:47:55.679 --> 01:47:58.310 align:start position:0%
departments that can accommodate almost

01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
students this amendment will not help
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in Durham or the
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
region in fact it will do the opposite
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
by taking affordable housing stock off
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
the market for families and placing it
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the hands of investors when upper
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
classman at UNH prefer the
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
interdependency of living off campus
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
Durham Apartments accommodate them with
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
well-maintained and managed options that
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
compete for their business these are
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
part of what we have built in the last 5
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
to 10 years the University's new
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
requirement that freshmen and sophomores
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
live on campus next year will place more
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
pressure on their professionally managed
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
departments and that puts pressure on
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
Durham landlords that have invested over
 
01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
100 million in Durham housing and that
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
is why this amendment has been
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
introduced this amendment will not make
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
housing more affordable but rather make
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
renting by the bed in single family
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
homes attractive to investors while
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
displacing families from our
 
01:48:59.910 --> 01:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods thank you for that part
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just add a couple of things
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
because of what has been testified to
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
someone said why would you come to UNH
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
if you knew it was this it was a
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
university you knew there was going to
 
01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
be problems but when we came all the
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
houses near the Middle School were owned
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
by faculty or owned by just regular
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
residents all along from where I live to
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
the hockey rink six houses were all
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
family-owned over the cast of the next
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
five to six years those houses became
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
bought by
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
investors and they put in at that time
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
could that was why we had to find
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
something to do and the three unrelated
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
rule at the time that we did it was
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
legal now whether or not it would be now
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you it's never been
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
challenged now but it did get challenged
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
in the white case which I think was in
 
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
77 or 78 and at that time they
 
01:50:07.709 --> 01:50:07.719 align:start position:0%
specifically referenced the US Supreme
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
Court and belter versus baras in
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
1974 that specifically said it was legal
 
01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:16.270 align:start position:0%
1974 that specifically said it was legal
for

01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
residents to limit occupancy to
 
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
unrelated I unrelated you can look it up
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
if you like it may not be relevant now
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been challenged since but it
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
was legal when we did it and we were
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
legally the other thing is any investor
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
who has come into Durham since the
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance was done has known about this
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance it was their choice to come in
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
knowing that they were going to be
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
restricted in terms of what they could
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
rent you so they have complaints now
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
disingenuous um so I guess that's my
 
01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
testimony you're welcome to answer any
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Gibbs yes ma'am thank
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
question this goes back to some of the
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
comments that we had earlier um might it
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
not be possible to solve the problems
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
that you describe by controlling the
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
investor Behavior rather rather than
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
controlling the relationships of the
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
tenants and specifically by requiring
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
that the in that the investors the
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
landlords rent per unit rather than per
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
bedroom as far as I know we've certain
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
we had a rental Housing Commission that
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
I was a member of when we had certain
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
landlords that were in that uh committee
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
I guess a town committee uh along with
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
some of the people in the administration
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
in the town and I I think if those
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
things were mentioned the landlords
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
would have no part of it I don't think
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
legally I'm not sure exactly but
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
somebody could tell me I'm not think
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
that we can legally require them to have
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
a certain type of
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
lease I know we had difficulty even
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
trying to have inspections done because
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
it for the safety of the people renting
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
we tried to work on that for years and
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
we were fought all the time by the
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
investors by the the owners so I can't
 
01:52:26.229 --> 01:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
answer your question as to what I know
 
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
we've tried to do everything we can I
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
can't answer the specific question thank
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
you you're wel okay thank you yes ma'am
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
representative D dzo thank you Mr chair
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for take my question so
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
speaking about the investor units what
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
what kind are they I mean are they
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
buying single family homes and
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
converting are they you know stacked
 
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
buildings or no just regular s single
 
01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
family homes and typically they might
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
have an Adu with
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
them um and you know this has been one
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
of the many things we have tried to do
 
01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
in the town to control our just normal
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
living like any one of you people here
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
would not want to be woken up night
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
after night at 2: or 3 in the morning by
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
people just walking by your house
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
shouting generally
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
inebriated it didn't used to happen when
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
I first came and we have it relatively
 
01:53:21.310 --> 01:53:21.320 align:start position:0%
well controlled now we have a tremendous
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
police force who will
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
come out when they need to we have a
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
community officer who will go and talk
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
to the houses when there's problems of
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
course next semester it's like deja vu
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
all over again same thing
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
happens and
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh so this is just one part of the
 
01:53:43.470 --> 01:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
armentarium of trying to deal with it
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
may I follow up please follow up so how
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
many investor units do you think there
 
01:53:50.109 --> 01:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
are in durm how many investors how many
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
investor units do you think you I don't
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
have that number maybe our planning
 
01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
director has it or our code enforcement
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
officer I think something like
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
805 by 90 I believe I saw that number 85
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
by 90 investor units yeah I mean it may
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
be more uh there's a lot of students
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
living we have a seven houses in our
 
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
street and I think four of them have
 
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
adus with students but the owners live
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
there so follow up again um so when you
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
look at Deeds
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
um in your property tax roles are the
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
investors identified as Xyz Inc or
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
something like that or we can't make
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
them commercial they have to be just
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
residential so they're so they are taxed
 
01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.149 align:start position:0%
residential so they're so they are taxed
as

01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
residential right as a certain number of
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
bedrooms but they
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
rent by the bed but are there particular
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
llc's or corporations that are buying up
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
these places uh there's three or four
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
landlords that may have more two or
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
three units okay
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
yes it isn't so it's really not easy to
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
identify as a widespread no and you
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
never know which one's going to go I
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
live in fear and I when this was first
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
proposed I really said to Our Town
 
01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
Administrator if this happens again and
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are five or six like we across
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%

01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%

Damon I'm wondering if um thank you and
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if there has been any
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
consideration or perhaps experience of
 
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.030 align:start position:0%
consideration or perhaps experience of
the

01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
Town becoming the investor and the
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
landlord I think everything has been
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
discussed and if we're not it's because
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
perfect so not affordable to buy it
 
01:55:57.239 --> 01:55:59.629 align:start position:0%
perfect so not affordable to buy it
right

01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank representative Alexander thank you
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm um thank you for taking my
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
question your testimony I'm concerned
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
when you say normal living because
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
Normal to me what I do at night like I'm
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
a bartender so I come home from work at
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
1100 p.m. and I might decide to have two
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
or three drinks and then by the time you
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
know it I'm in bed by 2: a.m. and you
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
know people that know me know that you
 
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
really can't contact me before noon if
 
01:56:25.350 --> 01:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not you know like sure would that be
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
considered normal living that concerns
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
me when you say normal like it's just a
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
different lifestyle I'm talking about a
 
01:56:32.589 --> 01:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
different lifestyle you you have to
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
understand that you come home and you
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
usually because you're in the
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood sure you might have had two
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
or three drinks but you're not going to
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
come in and shout and scream and no
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
typically you won't I don't think so
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
anybody would want that in their
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
neighborhood guess know if you do sir
 
01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
but most people living in the
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood would be upset if that was
 
01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
going on in the neighborhood and that's
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
why we're upset when it my concern is
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
have these students at all violated the
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
health and safety of your own
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
property at all have they violated your
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
safety they VI violated my
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
health okay I I'm going to leave it
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
there I know okay my mental
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
health okay thank you
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
um to The Honorable members of the House
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
special committee on housing um thank
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
speak um I am speaking in opposition to
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment proposed for S SP
 
01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:10.830 align:start position:0%
the amendment proposed for S SP
527

01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
um I am the town planner for Durham um I
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
have over 30 experience in four
 
01:58:21.550 --> 01:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities as a professional planner
 
01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot lot of experience with
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
housing um this amendment would have
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
very detrimental impacts on the cities
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
and towns in New
 
01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:32.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that host colleges and
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
universities and on the neighboring
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
communities um I see no benefits from
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
this bill uh to the public um the
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
benefits would would all ACR to a
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
handful of
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
investors um who would uh have therefore
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
be able to cram
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
um that's a word you hear a lot in town
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
cram more undergraduate students into
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
single family houses rather than three
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
four five six sky the limit um and make
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of money make a huge return um at
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
the expense of the neighborhood um
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
please keep in mind that within
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods single family and some of
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
them are mixed they have single family
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
they have some duplexes a lot of adus we
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
love adus in Durham um because it's
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
usually one student or two and the owner
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
lives on the premises keeps an eye on it
 
01:59:31.069 --> 01:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
I have an Adu they're wonderful um and
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
um well I I'll come back to that um so
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
that that that's the only benefit that I
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
would see not to the public certainly
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
not to the housing situation um I
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
briefly want to respond to a couple of
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
comments that have been made uh my
 
01:59:50.189 --> 01:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
colleague Ben Frost who I know well I
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
have tremendous respect for
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not an attorney but our town
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
attorney um has stated that this is
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
legal she's very conservative very
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
experienced in Municipal law um and this
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
this law of three unrelated has been
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
vetted um and but but even in terms of
 
02:00:14.109 --> 02:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
what Ben says there is certainly a
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
compelling interest for the town of
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
Durham to have this ordinance in place
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
and it is by far the most effective
 
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
um I you know Alternatives that have
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
been proposed they just would not be
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
effective um some people say well why
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
don't you enforce the other laws you
 
02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
know cars on lawns noise ordinance um
 
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
public drinking garbage um we try um it
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
still is often an issue but um I want to
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
give you an example as a as a planner
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
that um the value of having an
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance um that avoids a situation
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
that is going to be very problematic um
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
I used to be the planner in Rochester
 
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we had um we approved
 
02:01:06.990 --> 02:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
a number of Home occupations for people
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
to have um car maintenance for their
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
homes to make a little extra money and
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
the the owners we we required it was
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
allowed under our home occupation
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance at least by some discretion
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
always said I will have one car at a
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
time always in my garage um always be
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
quiet no noise Etc and a number of these
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
home occupations were approved in in a
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
number of cases it just became a real
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
problem the property owner had multiple
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
cars they were on the lawn uh they had
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
the garage open they were noisy and it
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
was a an enforcement Nightmare and once
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
it is set up um it's it's very very
 
02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce and as um uh Jay
 
02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
goose said we have a noise ordinance the
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
police will come this they're they're
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
gone they're inebriated they've gone
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
home it's virtually impossible to
 
02:02:03.709 --> 02:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
enforce the the intelligent thing is to
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
have an ordinance that does not give an
 
02:02:08.910 --> 02:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
opening to something that you know is is
 
02:02:13.270 --> 02:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a problem um the uh you know
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
one question was asked is this anything
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
to do with morals with couples living
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
together absolutely not I assure you
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
that that is that is not the case that
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
is never
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
never been a consideration uh another
 
02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
question was well families Buy in town
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
they know it's a University Town that's
 
02:02:32.830 --> 02:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
true and they also trust their local
 
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
government will protect them protect
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
their quality of life and their property
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
values and they also know that we have
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
this three unrelated rule um and the the
 
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
town works very hard to manage trash
 
02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:50.719 align:start position:0%
noise cars on Lots drunken behavior um
 
02:02:54.069 --> 02:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
um so Durham Durham is proud to host the
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire it's an
 
02:03:03.149 --> 02:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
outstanding uh top Public University
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of unh students live in our
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
town and in do New Market Portsmouth
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
summersworth and Rochester managing
 
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
student housing especially we're mainly
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
talking about single family houses in
 
02:03:20.109 --> 02:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods is a a fundamental and
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
even an existential issue in our town
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
when when we learned about this proposal
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
people were terrified in our community
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
about how the devastating impact this
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
would have on Durham on Hanover on
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
Plymouth on Keane and to some degree on
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester um we are holding a tiger by
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
the tail we love our students but it the
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
situation causes numerous problems
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
evaluating the impacts is an ongoing
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
matter of discussion frequently
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
deliberated by the town Council the
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
planning board the Conservation
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
Commission the energy committee the
 
02:03:59.229 --> 02:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
historic district commission and by our
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
housing task force and the staff we
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
delve into the Myriad details related to
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
student housing to maintain durm is a
 
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful diverse well-run Town while
 
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
also respecting the rights and concerns
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
of students we love our students student
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
housing is a major industry uh and
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in town uh the town approaches
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
the issue in good faith with much
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
analysis and input from the University
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
our partner landlords and residents
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
especially those who live in
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods this proposed law would
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
undermine that
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
process host communities are in the best
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
position to make these decisions unlike
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing where there is a huge
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
recognized need and countless challenges
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
to its development it doesn't pay for
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
itself we are wrestling with this how to
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
promote Workforce housing in an
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
expensive town like Durham um student
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
housing does not need an
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
assist they do just fine thank you very
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
much at at $1,400 a bed they're doing
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
just fine they do not need any help the
 
02:05:08.950 --> 02:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
students do not need help the landlords
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
do not need help um um students rights
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
to housing are not being infringed upon
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
um student housing brings in millions of
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in tax revenues and revenue and
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
supports our local businesses
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible and foolish for
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
us to try to restrict this use um as has
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
been mentioned most St most uh housing
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
developments are rented by the bed
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
students can pay that um if a
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom apartment or H single
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
family house for students rents for
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
$4,000 say 1350 a bed um then um
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
families will never be able to go there
 
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
and the thing to keep in mind is within
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
a neighborhood and we have l lots of
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods primarily single family
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
but they wonderful mixed historic
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods as I say duplexes
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
triplexes other apartments um
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
one problem house will destroy a street
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's just the reality of it so you
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
know we can talk about in in very the
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
theoretical terms about rights um but
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
how about balancing the rights and again
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
one problem house will destroy a street
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
and our ordinances are not very helpful
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
and the fact of the matter is that
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
Durham and other communities have hit
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
upon the the simplest direct most
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
effective way to address that and that
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
is a maximum three related it doesn't
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
always work but it's extremely effective
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
there is a correlation in a house
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
between the number of students and the
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
likelihood of having problems the more
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
than students the more likely you'll
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
have problems with three it seems to be
 
02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:52.719 align:start position:0%
kind of a magic number number in most
 
02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
cases it works really well um and
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
um so um just a few more a few more just
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
a few more comments if I may um so
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
addressing undergraduate student life
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
off campus is a highly particular and
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
complicated issue it must be worked
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
through by each municipality based upon
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
the individual character of the school
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
and the community what is being proposed
 
02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
is a very very blunt instrument which is
 
02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
not attending at all to the particular
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the half a dozen
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
towns that wrestle with this every
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
single day adopting this amendment will
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
be damaging not only to Durham and the
 
02:07:38.430 --> 02:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
other college towns U but also to the
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
colleges and our Flagship University UNH
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
in particular Our Town gown relationship
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
is excellent much of that's due to our
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
outstanding Town Administrator and a
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
series of of excellent uh presidents of
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
unh we've been very fortunate we have
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
excellent relations we communicate with
 
02:08:00.709 --> 02:08:00.719 align:start position:0%
them at every level um and one of the
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
major issues is addressing student
 
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
housing um and we are in line we the
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
university supports our rule um and I
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
want to tell you that if this ordinance
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
goes through um that will damage UNH our
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
Flagship University because Town gown
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
relations will suff ER it will engender
 
02:08:25.709 --> 02:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
ill will in the community many residents
 
02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
longtime residents will be very angry
 
02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be angry at unage they won't
 
02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
shop downtown they'll they'll badmouth
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
UNH um and that will affect the
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
university image and brand is very
 
02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
important and this will impact our
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
Flagship University's ability to recruit
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
faculty and students in the highly
 
02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
competitive environment in which all
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
colleges are now operating the town of
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
Durham is highly engaged in addressing
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing crisis I serve as
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
staff to the Durham housing task force
 
02:09:00.510 --> 02:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
whose mission it is to promote housing
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
options and affordable housing um and I
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
want to say I am also on the board of
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
the workforce Housing Coalition of the
 
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast of SE Coast New Hampshire so
 
02:09:13.069 --> 02:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
I'm very this issue is very close to my
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
heart I've spoken about housing numerous
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
times but um and the the workforce
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
Housing Coalition is not taking a
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
position on this and I I am speaking as
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
myself not this is not for the workforce
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
Housing Coalition I bring that up only
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
because of my to show my commitment to
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
this issue um and I respect um the
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative from housing action um
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
but I I I firmly disagree um you know I
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
I enthusiastically support certain
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
thoughtful mandates from the state
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
regarding housing that are needed an Adu
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
statute was passed uh five or so years
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
ago and that was great that was a
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
mandate because communities were in my
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
opinion irresponsibly not allowing adus
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
adus are great you know it's not going
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
to hurt your neighborhood they're
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
well-managed and if your community is
 
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
not allowing them the state should come
 
02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
in and make you do it the state did that
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
that was an excellent statute there's
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
another statute about adus taking that
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
further I applaud that effort that is
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's been vetted and
 
02:10:21.549 --> 02:10:21.559 align:start position:0%
discussed with all the state
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um so as a um but this
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
proposal has in no is in no way
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
comparable this has not been vetted we
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
are the experts at Durham and Hanover
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Kean nobody spoke to us
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
about it my understanding is two
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
landlords showed up at a public hearing
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
frankly two landlords who have had a
 
02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:44.559 align:start position:0%
number of run-ins with the town um
 
02:10:46.910 --> 02:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
because of of not respecting some of our
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
ordinances and we were not even aware
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
when this thing came forward so that was
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
very upsetting for us to learn about
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
this after the fact um as a professional
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
Town planner with over 30 years of
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
experience um I I do think that I am
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an expert in the housing
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
issue and I will assure you that this
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
proposal will not ass help our housing
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
situation it will undercut those efforts
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
again because of a single family house
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
rather than being attractive and having
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities for families um of Modera
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
income nobody will be able to compete
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
when when the rent is is $66,000 from
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
six students in there this is a
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue for Durham and for
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
other college
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
towns um please respect our community's
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
long-standing good faith efforts to deal
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
with this challenging local matter and
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
please direct important efforts toward
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing um in other areas that
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
will be effective and please find this
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill inexpedient to l legislate thank
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
you representative B thank you Mr chair
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and testifying
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
um you spoke a little bit about how the
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between the the the school
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
and the town are very good correct I
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
mean but I'm looking at like this
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
resolution by the student Senate that
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
they put out last month and it literally
 
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
says at the end to condemn the tone of
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
the Town Council of Durham and claim
 
02:12:19.390 --> 02:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
that the students are separate
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
residential Enclave of Durham and cannot
 
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.669 align:start position:0%
residential Enclave of Durham and cannot
be

02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
co-inhabit traditional residential
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
communities and it it says earlier in it
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
that they believe that you implying that
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
students in the town of Durham are
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
separate constituencies and do not
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
necess necessitate Equal Housing
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
considerations I guess what I'm saying
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
is like the student Senate opposes it or
 
02:12:43.149 --> 02:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
is in favor of this but the town is
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
against it what if all the students
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
voted in town elections that ordinance
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
would go right
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
away uh well I I we welcome our students
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
to vote and we welcome them to sit on
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
Town boards uh there's some very young
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
people on the planning board and on the
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
Town Council now um we're very pleased
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
about um well you know I can't speak for
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
the person I I um I think that if um the
 
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
majority well this you know the majority
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
of students are probably are not
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
informed about the issue they're not
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
sensitive to um you know issues in
 
02:13:19.470 --> 02:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods for families um you know I
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think that the officials at UNH would
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
certainly support us um and I think if
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
student many students who were
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful um you know if they had an
 
02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sit down and talk with me
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
and other Town officials and we could
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
talk about the issue uh I think many of
 
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
them would support the provisions we
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
have in place um you know I for whatever
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
reason I think some students probably
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate some other
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
supporters um you know may feel some
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
alienation because there are this is a
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
big issue um we have had some projects
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
where there were student housing
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
proposed that there were that that
 
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
people were very upset about where a
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
great deal of student housing was
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
proposed in a new development close to a
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and I think there was some
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
alienation there but generally we have
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
excellent relations with students um
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
they see it differently you know most of
 
02:14:17.709 --> 02:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
them are living in in student
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
developments are on campus they are not
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
attuned to the problem s and I live in a
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
single family house in Durham and I've
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
had people come by at 3: in the morning
 
02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:27.790 align:start position:0%
had people come by at 3: in the morning
screaming

02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
screaming
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
inebriated um most students are
 
02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful we love our students we are
 
02:14:35.709 --> 02:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
our town will dry up would dry up
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
without UNH um but we are holding a
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
tiger by the tail we have to manage this
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
and um this is legal it is appropriate
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
where we are drawing the line at
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
families and they could be up to 10
 
02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
people versus is unrelated and unrelated
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
when you have four or more not always
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
but in many cases in a single family
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
neighborhood when they're inebriated on
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
a Thursday Friday or Saturday night they
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't behave well it's oil and water
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
many of them are wonderful but the the
 
02:15:10.830 --> 02:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
the odds of it happening with an
 
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated household which in Durham is
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
going to be undergraduate students is
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
vastly greater and isn't that what we do
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
in policy
 
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
we set our policy based on um costs and
 
02:15:27.870 --> 02:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
benefits and probabilities um so yes
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
some families behave badly many students
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
behave wonderfully but there is a very
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
clear correlation and this is therefore
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
we could we believe its effective
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
policy okay follow up it it seems to me
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
the policy you put in place benefits 33%
 
02:15:46.109 --> 02:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
at the expense to 66% of the residents
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
of your town well who is it
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
hurting student rents like the price of
 
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
housing U most students you know not
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
affected I'm on campus we have thousands
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
of of units in large student housing
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
developments that are wonderful um it's
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
mainly affecting people in houses in
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and the landlords who wish
 
02:16:11.950 --> 02:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
that they could rent to five or six kids
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not aware of many Stu you
 
02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:16.559 align:start position:0%
know there's probably some students that
 
02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know four or five of them would love
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
to rent a house in a neighborhood um you
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
know they could go to do there's many
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
other housing opportunities I think
 
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
those situations are rare also by the
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
way this has no effect on fraternities
 
02:16:32.669 --> 02:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
and boarding houses does not that
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
they're they're not affected by this
 
02:16:37.709 --> 02:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
ordinance represent
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
giv thank you
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
um you've mentioned several times uh
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
what you believe that the views of
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
students are and you mentioned earlier
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
during your
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that um you asked for input
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
from residents uh but did you ask for
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
input from student
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
organizations because it does seem to me
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
and here I speak as as someone uh who
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
was a graduate student um lived in a
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that was about half
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
families and half students in a a single
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
unit that had four students living
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
together and later on in a house uh that
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
had five people some of them working
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
some of them students living together
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
because that was the most workable and
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
affordable um uh type of housing that
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
that we could find so it it it does seem
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
to me that um the people who would be
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
harmed um uh by not passing this
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
amendment uh would not only be the
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
investors um but would also be those
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
students who need to find housing in
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
groups which students almost always do
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
if they need to live off campus so back
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
to to my question sorry for going on a
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
bit um did you ask for input from
 
02:17:55.679 --> 02:17:57.030 align:start position:0%
bit um did you ask for input from
student

02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
organizations well our ordinance has
 
02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
been in place for many years so we
 
02:18:05.070 --> 02:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
haven't um you know needed to um have a
 
02:18:06.669 --> 02:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
dialogue about it it's been in place and
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's function well but the dialogue that
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
is ongoing in the community is about
 
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
General zoning and housing issues and um
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
I you know I speak with students and
 
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders all the time members
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
of fraternity
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
uh people in houses um our certainly our
 
02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
code enforcement officer does so you
 
02:18:27.870 --> 02:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
know I think we have a pretty good sense
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
of of of the the world that we operate
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
in um and again it's it's everything is
 
02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
a tradeoff so I I believe the very small
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
number of groups of four five or six
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
that would like to live together in a
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
house that cannot do that in Durham
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
versus the benefits of limiting three I
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know I just see the cost benefit
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
like this there's so many options for
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
students I know there's some students
 
02:18:56.669 --> 02:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
that struggle that we have we have
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
homeless students in in Durham we have
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
students that are living in their cars
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
um which is very upsetting but that has
 
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to do that has to do with very
 
02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
tragic family Dynamics nothing to do
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
with this but um the tradeoff seems
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
clear to us and there are so many
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
options again with adus um oncampus
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
housing um renting in do where they they
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
don't have this rule or New Market or
 
02:19:25.629 --> 02:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
Rochester and in housing developments
 
02:19:28.589 --> 02:19:28.599 align:start position:0%
off campus the ability to rent and over
 
02:19:31.150 --> 02:19:31.160 align:start position:0%
may I do a followup sorry um wouldn't
 
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to rent and over be um
 
02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
dependent upon Transportation which not
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
all students have right but there are
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
many options overall for
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
students but back to my original
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned during your
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that you have uh requested
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
input um and I don't know when you when
 
02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
you were referring to whether it was
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
when you originally passed the ordinance
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
or more recently it sounds like more
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
recently you have been specifically
 
02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
requesting input from residents you can
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong so when you did
 
02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
that did you request input from from
 
02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
students and I speak in reference to um
 
02:20:13.469 --> 02:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
the student Senate resolution that um
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
reference um well again the the input is
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
not regarding our because that is has
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
been in place a long time the input is
 
02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
in my daily job um dealing with planning
 
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
zoning and housing people that come in
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
to talk with me um General issues when
 
02:20:37.150 --> 02:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
we reach out to the broad Community all
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders including the UNH
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
officials and students undergraduate and
 
02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
graduate so it nothing and then we also
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
our housing task force um has reached
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
out a lot has had a major Outreach
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
effort to stakeholders about housing in
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
general um we've gotten input from UNH
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
administrators Town employees
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters teachers um graduate
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
students um some undergraduates that
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we were able to contact so you know
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
I I I suspect probably many
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
undergraduate students from their point
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
of view if they learn about this
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
ordinance they'd say GE I don't like
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
that but it's not really affecting them
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
they probably don't are not sensitized
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the issue
 
02:21:32.590 --> 02:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah many probably would not like it
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
just on the idea of it but again in
 
02:21:37.309 --> 02:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
terms of cost benefit what's really
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
happening on the ground you know okay
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you have a question
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh thank you Mr chair
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
and I have three quick ones if that's
 
02:21:52.349 --> 02:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
okay yep first one regarding this Senate
 
02:21:55.830 --> 02:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
resolution anybody know how many of the
 
02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
senators in UNH own
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
home I would guess none but you don't
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
have to answer that oh well I I probably
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know none of them on their own but
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of historically
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
um undergraduate students when they come
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
to Durham usually as a freshman their
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
Savvy parent will buy a house and the
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
student I don't I think they have to
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
live on campus freshman year and now
 
02:22:25.469 --> 02:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
sophomore year but they'll buy a house
 
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
at some point the child will live there
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
with roommates um and then the parent
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
may keep it or they'll sell it years
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
later usually at a pretty good profit um
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of the issues you know that's
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
one of the kinds of investors that we
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
have and as my next question I believe
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned but I just want to
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
clarify from my notes what year was the
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh ordinance and Durham adopt
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know I heard
 
02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:54.910 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know I heard
70s

02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
70s
 
02:23:00.429 --> 02:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
unrated three unrelated yeah 86 thank
 
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
you and I have one more um how many
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
other towns or cities in New Hampshire
 
02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
have the three unrelated ordinance yeah
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um I don't know
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
exactly um the representative that
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
presented this I think she mentioned
 
02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
eight municipalities I don't but I don't
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
know that U I do know that um Handover
 
02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm often in contact with planners
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
in Hanover Plymouth and Keane to a
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
lesser extent um Manchester um comparing
 
02:23:41.309 --> 02:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
notes about the ordinances and policies
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
that they have to manage this issue so I
 
02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's a little different in every
 
02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
Community but everybody wrestles with it
 
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
in their own way
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay that it okay um I only
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
have one comment I know that there's a
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
lot of colleges and univers and a couple
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
universities in New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
wondering why Durham and UNH are the
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
only ones that showed up to even say
 
02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
anything today well we have had some
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
email connection with um I think you got
 
02:24:14.670 --> 02:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
a letter from somebody might have been
 
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
the town manager from
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
hover um and um that that I I don't know
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know people are busy they we we've
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
had some email exchanges
 
02:24:30.910 --> 02:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
um Durham was pretty vocal in our email
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
maybe they assumed that we were taking
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
the lead on it I don't know okay thank
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair oh one more Yeah question
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
to the chair could it be because this is
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
heard

02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%

02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
just start out by giving you some
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
information based on some of the
 
02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
questions I heard earlier uh and if you
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
have any other questions for me I'd be
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them um so these are
 
02:25:59.269 --> 02:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
kind of some factual backup to some of
 
02:25:59.279 --> 02:26:00.150 align:start position:0%
kind of some factual backup to some of
the

02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions um one of the questions that a
 
02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative asked was wasn't didn't
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
Durham uh wasn't Durham applying the
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
three unrelated uh illegally already
 
02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
because of the accessory dwelling unit
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
with the single family dwelling and uh
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
the state law that read the state law
 
02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
6747 two for uh accessory dwelling units
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
um number four states that any Municipal
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
regulation applicable to single family
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
dwelling shall also apply to the
 
02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
combination of principal dwelling and
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
Adu so it's permitted in the uh recent
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
Adu regulation that the current laws uh
 
02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
can apply to both units and that's
 
02:26:47.309 --> 02:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens in Durham today is
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
that the three unrelated regulation was
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
was in place for single families and
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
therefore it is in place for the Adu
 
02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
plus the single family I just wanted to
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
make it clear that we're not breaking
 
02:27:01.389 --> 02:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
any laws by enforcing that at this
 
02:27:01.399 --> 02:27:07.870 align:start position:0%
any laws by enforcing that at this
point

02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to uh also back up what
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
Michael was saying well we don't
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
regulate by who's sleeping in what bed
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
or how many beds there are you can have
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
a a one-bedroom apartment and have three
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
unrelated people we don't have any
 
02:27:29.150 --> 02:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
regulation or anything to think or say
 
02:27:31.150 --> 02:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
about that at all and so it's not a
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
matter of bedroom having said that
 
02:27:36.429 --> 02:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
there's no distinction between a bedroom
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
and any other room in a house um unless
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a house on a
 
02:27:45.269 --> 02:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
private septic system where the system
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
by Dees calls out how many bedrooms that
 
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
house is allowed to have if you're on
 
02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
Town Water and Sewer uh any room is a
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
bedroom and I've seen it many times that
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
in a traditional home the formal living
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
room and the formal dining room are now
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
bedrooms because people are using them
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
as bedrooms so I don't know how we would
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
even identify how many bedrooms a house
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
had um in this uh proposal um because I
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes fall asleep in the bathtub but
 
02:28:21.309 --> 02:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
it you know is that a bedroom I I don't
 
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
know um going to the fire code that that
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost was discussing the fire code
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
is uh only um restricted to no less than
 
02:28:37.389 --> 02:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
200 square fet per person so my my home
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
is 1500 square fet that could hold seven
 
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
individuals I can't say I haven't
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes had seven relatives at my
 
02:28:49.269 --> 02:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
house but I I I know that that young
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
people have very active social lives
 
02:28:54.830 --> 02:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
they have friends and partners and seven
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
people really means 20 people in my
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
experience in a lot of cases on many
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
nights uh in
 
02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
nights uh in
Durham

02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
um let me I I was taking notes as we're
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
going so you have to excuse me a minute
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
um an unrelated household uh the
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
question was what is Durham's definition
 
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
household um of two of more people
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
related within a second degree of
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
kinship by civil law or marriage or
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
adoption or foster care uh I don't know
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
what the civil law is for unmarried
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
couples living together whether they're
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
considered married or not but the second
 
02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
degree of uh relation is spouse children
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
parents brothers sisters half Brothers
 
02:29:49.469 --> 02:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
half Brothers grandchildren and
 
02:29:49.479 --> 02:29:51.349 align:start position:0%
half Brothers grandchildren and
grandparents

02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
grandparents
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
um the third level would include Aunts
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
Uncles nieces nephews great-grandparents
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
so there is definition for what the
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
levels of kinship are uh and Durham's
 
02:30:04.590 --> 02:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
Durham's ordinance says with the second
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
degree of
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
kinship um as as been mentioned uh there
 
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
is a Supreme Court case
 
02:30:17.469 --> 02:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
that has uh the decision that it is
 
02:30:20.349 --> 02:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
legal to restrict people by their
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
familial or related status and that is
 
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
the fiser versus New Hampshire State
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
Building Code review uh case which as
 
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
was in Durham uh there were two cases
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
one was very early on I think in the 50s
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
but then again in the in the 80s and the
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court did rule that it was uh
 
02:30:47.469 --> 02:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
not discriminatory to have the
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
regulation that that Durham had at the
 
02:30:49.479 --> 02:30:51.230 align:start position:0%
regulation that that Durham had at the
time

02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:30:53.469 --> 02:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
um to go on to some uh just a couple of
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
points that aren't in strict law since I
 
02:30:59.830 --> 02:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
do the enforcement I actually see uh I
 
02:31:01.990 --> 02:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
see a lot of other situations that
 
02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been discussed here because
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about the word
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
students and um just like with any
 
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement there's a
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
prioritization system that one has to
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
follow because we only have certain
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
amount of resources so if you look at
 
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
the estate Trooper on the highway most
 
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
people people are going 65 70 maybe a
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
little over the speed limit but that
 
02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
state trooper has to look at who he's
 
02:31:28.990 --> 02:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
going to or she is going to pull over
 
02:31:30.190 --> 02:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
and they're going to look at the car
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's swerving in between between lanes
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
speeding throwing trash out the window
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
or other activities that raise it above
 
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
the average violation so to speak and
 
02:31:43.630 --> 02:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's true with the enforcement that we
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
do for the um activities that happen in
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
these three unrelated or any other
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
property in town
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
um if there isn't some impact that's
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
impacting or visible then I probably w't
 
02:32:00.990 --> 02:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
even know that there's three unrelated
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
or not so I'm enforcing the most
 
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
impactful violations of the ordinance
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
and that's not always students we have
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
some that are there was mentioned
 
02:32:13.990 --> 02:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's families that
 
02:32:16.429 --> 02:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
fight um there's families that have
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
trashy Lawns and park on their lawns um
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
so it's a matter of the level of the
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
violation not who lives there so we
 
02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're not
 
02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
focusing the regulation on students it
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
is true that young people are out there
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
the first time probably away from home
 
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
they need some guard reels to understand
 
02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
what it means to live on their own in a
 
02:32:46.349 --> 02:32:46.359 align:start position:0%
community um and we talk with them
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
regularly on a on a uh informal basis
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh every semester every every year when
 
02:32:56.429 --> 02:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
when new young people move into town we
 
02:32:58.110 --> 02:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
talk with them about what the
 
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
expectation is for their trash for their
 
02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
parking for their activities in town and
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh and before it ever gets to any kind
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
of formal enforcement um many
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities for them to learn um what
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
the expectations are and often when I'm
 
02:33:18.910 --> 02:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing households that are not
 
02:33:21.870 --> 02:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
occupied by young people they also have
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
to come into compliance so it it it just
 
02:33:27.630 --> 02:33:27.640 align:start position:0%
so happens that the the young people
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
households are still learning how to do
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
it so they tend to be a more out of
 
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
compliance on a regular basis than some
 
02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:36.550 align:start position:0%
compliance on a regular basis than some
other

02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
households um okay I'd be happy to take
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
any questions any
 
02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative band thank you
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair are you telling me that you
 
02:33:50.190 --> 02:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
more strictly enforce student housing
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
than opposed to other residents of
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
Durham no I think I was saying that I
 
02:33:56.429 --> 02:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
don't more strictly enforce them that I
 
02:33:59.070 --> 02:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
actually enforce them I enforce the
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
level of violation not necessarily the
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
individual people that live in the house
 
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay and then my other question is we
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about um order of
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
kinship third degree so you're talking
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
like Aunt uncle that sort of thing is
 
02:34:17.429 --> 02:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
third degree
 
02:34:20.670 --> 02:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
kinship so that third degree out based
 
02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
on your Definition of kinship third
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
degree kinship if there's four four
 
02:34:28.190 --> 02:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
people that are related within three
 
02:34:30.030 --> 02:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
degrees they wouldn't be allowed to live
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
together because you would have so say
 
02:34:35.389 --> 02:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
if like an aunt wanted to adopt their
 
02:34:37.469 --> 02:34:37.479 align:start position:0%
nephew or niece and have them live in
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
the same house as them otherwise they'd
 
02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
be homeless based on your ordinance they
 
02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to do that or are
 
02:34:45.150 --> 02:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
you allowed to un are you allowed to
 
02:34:47.269 --> 02:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
enforce the ordinance for students but
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
not the ordinance for the aunt that
 
02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
wants to adopt their nephew I guess I'm
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
wondering like do you discriminate do
 
02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
you do you enforce one ordinance for one
 
02:34:57.269 --> 02:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
group of people over an ordinance for
 
02:34:58.830 --> 02:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
another group of people in town that's
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking no I I I approach the
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the vi of the ordinances
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
and the violation based on the level of
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
impact um or the amount of violation
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
going on given the uh amount of time I
 
02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
have to enforce so if if there was a
 
02:35:20.269 --> 02:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
household with an aunt who's adopting
 
02:35:24.510 --> 02:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
her best friend's child for instance uh
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
unless that household is
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
also um very visibly violating the
 
02:35:32.429 --> 02:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
ordinance first of all I would never
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
know second of all they can have up to
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
two unrelated people so in that case
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily make it a
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
violation um that's helpful yeah thank
 
02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:35:50.269 --> 02:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um
 
02:35:53.349 --> 02:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh just a a comment first of all um and
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
that is that um someone who was in the
 
02:35:59.590 --> 02:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
POS process of adopting a child that
 
02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
would come under both federal and state
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
familial status law so um that would
 
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
also be helpful there uh but the
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
question that I wanted to ask and thank
 
02:36:11.590 --> 02:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking it um you mentioned
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
earlier that uh the three unrelated rule
 
02:36:17.269 --> 02:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
could legally be applied to the main
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
unit plus the Adu and I'm not sure um
 
02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
how that would how that would work um
 
02:36:30.030 --> 02:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
that is suppose I um rent a house with a
 
02:36:34.469 --> 02:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
roommate who is not related to me and uh
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
then there's an Adu and two roommates
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
who are unrelated rent that Adu so that
 
02:36:43.469 --> 02:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
would be two unrelated people in the
 
02:36:46.830 --> 02:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
house and two unrelated people in the
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
Adu um would that violate your three
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated uh ordinance or not yes it
 
02:36:57.110 --> 02:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
would our ordinance um and the state law
 
02:37:00.269 --> 02:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
the Adu state law uh which coincides
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
with our ordinance says that the single
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
family dwelling with an Adu is in many
 
02:37:06.990 --> 02:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
ways treated like a single family
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
dwelling you don't have to have a larger
 
02:37:11.790 --> 02:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
lot size there's many things that you
 
02:37:13.950 --> 02:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
would be required to have if you had two
 
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
separate dwelling units that the Adu
 
02:37:19.230 --> 02:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
regulation the state regulation doesn't
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
re require because the purpose of it was
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
to make them as readily available as
 
02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
possible therefore not making two
 
02:37:31.630 --> 02:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
separate units so our local law
 
02:37:35.469 --> 02:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
coincides with the ability to have to uh
 
02:37:38.110 --> 02:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
to apply the three unrelated to those
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
two units as one as one unit so that
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
would that would be in
 
02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:47.230 align:start position:0%
would that would be in
violation

02:37:47.230 --> 02:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
followup I just wanted to mention that
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
that appears what you just um uh
 
02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
specified um that appears to contradict
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier testimony that uh
 
02:37:59.550 --> 02:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
indicated that the ordinance would not
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
be applied in that way so I don't know
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
which which governs but I just wanted to
 
02:38:04.319 --> 02:38:05.950 align:start position:0%
which which governs but I just wanted to
mention

02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
mention
 
02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you as the code enforcement
 
02:38:11.269 --> 02:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
officer I have to say that I'm 100%
 
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
you okay all set okay thank you very
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you that concludes all the
 
02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:22.269 align:start position:0%
much thank you that concludes all the
testimony

02:38:22.269 --> 02:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
wait so we're going to close the hearing
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
now um on um 527 um Germain um n Germain
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um okay thank you
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
represent so we had noticed in executive
 
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
session we have three members absent so
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
I think um I'm G to hold off on that for
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
a week or so um I'm
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
thinking I know representative Walsh is
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
ready to vote but I don't think I'm
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
ready to vote yet um so if you need a
 
02:38:54.910 --> 02:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
sub for the day of the executive session
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
feel free to let us know and we'll
 
02:38:59.429 --> 02:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
appoint a sub um but I will hold off I'm
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
thinking either a session day during a
 
02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
lunch that everyone's here so make it
 
02:39:07.389 --> 02:39:07.399 align:start position:0%
easy or or a Friday but um I will let
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
the committee know does anybody while we
 
02:39:12.269 --> 02:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
notice the exact does anybody have any
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary um things to say about
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
either of the two
 
02:39:18.230 --> 02:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
bills something for any of us to think
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
about anything
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we're in EXA we're in exact
 
02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
technically I'm not going to have any
 
02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
votes but if you'd like to
 
02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:32.439 --> 02:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
exact

02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:40.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
um okay so I'm going to hold off on the
 
02:39:44.429 --> 02:39:44.439 align:start position:0%
exact and we'll have this another day
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:48.319 --> 02:40:18.309 align:start position:0%
 
everyone

02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
