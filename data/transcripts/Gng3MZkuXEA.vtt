hearing this morning we're going to
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
begin our with our hearing this morning
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
we are going to
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
limit people to a particular time limit
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
because we have so many uh
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
people to speak i went through the cards
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
this morning there are only two people
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
uh that ask for more than three minutes
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
on their cards
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
and one of them being the sponsor of the
 
00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.190 align:start position:0%
and one of them being the sponsor of the
bill

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to limit everybody to three
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
minutes uh which i think is fair
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
except for the sponsors
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
who i think should have adequate
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to explain
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
if not what i'm going to do is i'm going
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
to go down front i think and
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
just for the committee just in terms of
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
organization i just and for the
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
committee's planning
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
we are scheduled for a session next week
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
session will be on wednesday and
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
thursday the 16th and the 17th
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
and what i would like to do is on the
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
18th friday the 18th is have an
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
the uh and that will give us by doing
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
that uh we can get uh exec these bills
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing today and the one
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
other bill that we heard previously that
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't been exact yet
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
but that would
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
that would be able to free us up so we
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
would have that next week free and i
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
think probably two weeks free before we
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
get enough senate bills in order to
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
start having hearings again
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
so it'd give us two weeks off
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
so plan on the morning of the 18th for
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
biological father of an unborn child
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
to petition the court for an injunction
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the biological mother from
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
having an abortion the primary sponsor
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1181
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
this bill tackles a very controversial
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
and sensitive issue but there does not
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
need to be any controversy with this
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill as it simply addresses a gap or
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
deficiency that legal precedents and
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
laws have failed to close or to remedy
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
to date
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
in its roe vs wade decision the united
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
states supreme court established a right
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
of personal privacy protected by the due
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
process clause that includes the right
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
of a woman to determine whether or not
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
to bear a child
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has repeatedly
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
affirmed that the state has a vested
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting the life of the
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
pre-born baby while simultaneously
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of the pregnant
 
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of the pregnant
woman

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
woman
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
in planned parenthood versus casey the
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruled that in order to
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
protect the central right recognized in
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
roe versus wade while at the same time
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
accommodating the state's profound
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
interest in potential life
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
the undue burden standard should be
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
employed this means an undue burden
 
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
exists and therefore a provision of law
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
is invalid if its purpose or effect is
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
to place substantial obstacles in the
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
path of a woman seeking an abortion
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
before the fetus attains viability
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has also stated that
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
the pregnant woman bears a greater
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
burden than the father therefore the
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
protection of her rights is of greater
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
weight than the father's rights
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
and although the supreme court has
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
stated that the protection of the
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
woman's rights is of greater weight they
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
have never said that the father has
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
no rights
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
no uterus no opinion is not the law
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's only been standard operating
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
procedure since 1973.
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
this bill maintains the state's interest
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the life of the pre-born baby
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
protects all the rights of the pregnant
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
woman but now recognizes the rights of
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the father
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
and in recognition of the greater burden
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
naturally being on the pregnant woman
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
this bill ensures that the greater
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
burden is placed on the father but at
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
least now he has an opportunity to have
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
his voice heard and his rights
 
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.470 align:start position:0%
his voice heard and his rights
recognized

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is allow the father
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
of a pre-born baby to file a pre a
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
petition with the local court in his
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for an injunction to
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
prevent the woman who is pregnant with
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
his child from obtaining an abortion in
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
order that he may raise the child
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
this bill avoids conflict with all
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
established legal precedents it avoids
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
conflict with
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood versus casey and
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood versus danforth which
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
declared that the pregnant woman does
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
not have to inform the father of the
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
baby of her pregnancy even if the father
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
is her husband this bill assumes the
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
father knows of the pregnancy by
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
whatever means the woman is not required
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
to tell the father
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
this bill avoids any undue burden by
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
requiring the injunction be approved or
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
denied within any established
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
gestational limits in the state of new
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire that was recently established
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks this means the injunction
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
must be approved or denied before 24
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
weeks gestation in order to allow
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient time for the pregnant woman
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
to obtain an abortion should the
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
injunction be denied
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill maintains protection of the
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
woman's rights in the case of rape or
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
incest it protects the woman's rights as
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
it pertains to her physical health
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
this bill goes even further to protect
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
the rights of the woman by allowing her
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
to obtain an abortion after the
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
gestational limit 24 weeks here in new
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire at the father's expense if the
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
injunction has to be revoked due to his
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
actions this prevents fathers from
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
abusing the injunctive process
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does not allow an injunction
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
to be granted if the father has been
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
convicted of any sexual crimes violent
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
crimes or crimes against children
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
this bill requires the petitioner to
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
execute a voluntary acknowledgement of
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
paternity that is not subject to be
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
rescinded or challenged this means only
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
the actual biological father of the
 
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
the actual biological father of the
child

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
can be granted an injunction
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
if the pregnant woman denies the
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
petitioner's paternity the petitioner
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
may request dna testing but he is
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
required to pay the cost of that testing
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
for both him and her
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
and if the dna testing shows he is not
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
the father the petition is immediately
 
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.669 align:start position:0%
the father the petition is immediately
denied

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
denied
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill protects the woman's personal
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
safety throughout the entire process she
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
may attend all medical appointments
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
without the father being present if she
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
has any concerns for personal safety she
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
may request a restraining order against
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
the father and that is up to the
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
discretion of the judge to issue
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the father has additional financial
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the pregnant woman
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
throughout pregnancy her only
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
to excuse me ensure proper care of
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
herself and the baby throughout
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy upon birth the mother has no
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
obligations to the child or the father
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
and her name will even be omitted from
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
the baby's birth certificate
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
this bill presents a simple common sense
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
means of closing the gap that exists in
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
current legal precedent and law by
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
ensuring the rights of the father are
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
recognized with its proper weight in
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
this very sensitive subject
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
his rights remain to of lesser weight
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
than hers
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
but this bill ensures that the weight of
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
his right is actually now considered
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative greeson yes
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned that the bill
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes um the right of the father
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
but it preserves you know the relative
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
weight of of the father versus the
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
mother so i just kind of want to get
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
some insight into your thinking as to
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
what kind of situations an injunction
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
when it would be granted
 
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
when it would be granted
when

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
what's what situations if you were to
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
petition the if the father were to
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
petition the court
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
can you walk me through a situation
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
where you think
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
this is this this would warrant
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
um the granting of the injunction given
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
the relative right to the mother and the
 
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
the relative right to the mother and the
father

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
father
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
man finds out that a woman is pregnant
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
with his child
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
presumably all right
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
at that point that he finds out and
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
again she is not legally obligated to
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
inform him he finds out
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
he is able to go before the court and re
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
and petition the court if he is assuming
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
that there's there's a reasonable
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
assumption that she would seek an
 
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.190 align:start position:0%
assumption that she would seek an
abortion

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
at some time
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
he can petition the court at that point
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
he has to declare that he is the father
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
if she challenges that
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
then that's he he would then have to say
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
i would like dna testing and dna
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
advancements or they can get the results
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
back within a week so that's not an
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
overburden on anybody but he has to pay
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
um assuming that he is the biological
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
father of the child
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
at that point the the the injunction
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
once the in a legal proceeding once
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
there is a petition for an injunction
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
unless it is immediately rejected for
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
some reason the injunction
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
is temporarily
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
automatically put in place if i'm
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
understanding the law correctly and if
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a someone who a judge that can
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
correct me on that that would be fine
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that the
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
injunction is a temporary injunction
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
to allow for
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
the process to be heard
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
so in other words he files the petition
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
for an injunction she says oh no a
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
petition was filed i'm going to go out
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
and get an abortion at that at that
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
moment there's a service time there
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
again it could happen if she does it
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
before she served with the end with the
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh with with the paperwork informing her
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
but assuming she doesn't do that
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
then that's where the details of
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
everything comes out
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
again the judge is going to hear the
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
case of i am the biological father i
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
want to be able to raise this child as
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
my own she is under no further
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
obligation of
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
i just want the child to be able to
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
raise the child for my for my own the
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
judge would then go through the process
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
with him this is what the law requires
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
this is uh what your obligations are
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
financially to her to the child
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the process and then she
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
would understand what her rights are
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
through all of that again the judge
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
would explain all that to them and
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
assuming that there is no
 
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
assuming that there is no
criminal

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
past history of his that would prevent
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
the the uh the injunction for all
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes it would go through
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a reason to deny
 
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.230 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a reason to deny
it

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh and so as long as he's the biological
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
father and he's he doesn't have a a
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
criminal history
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then if there are any other
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
instructions that the judge would would
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
issue on that uh a restraining order
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
stay in uh so many distance apart or you
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
are not allowed to go to any of the
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
medical appointments with her any
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
instructions from the judge and if he
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
violates those instructions from the
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
judge like any other
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
instructions from a judge there are
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
penalties that come with that and one of
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
those penalties would be if the judge
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
has to rescind the injunction then she
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
can go and and if she chooses to at that
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
point still even after the 24 weeks she
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to obtain the abortion
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
it would it would the the process would
 
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
it would it would the the process would
be

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
be
that

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
as long as there's nothing to deny it
 
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
as long as there's nothing to deny it
then

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
what would happen in the event that two
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
or more men
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
well only one gets to win
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
because i don't know that there's ever
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
been two men impregnate the same woman
 
00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:39.990 align:start position:0%
been two men impregnate the same woman
so

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
only the biological father
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
well this is a time sensitive
 
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.669 align:start position:0%
well this is a time sensitive
issue

00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
what would be the process for
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
determining the father
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
i can imagine a situation where a woman
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
has been raped by two or more men
 
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.430 align:start position:0%
has been raped by two or more men
and

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
every one of those men could claim to be
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
the father
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
only only one man is going to be the
 
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.149 align:start position:0%
only only one man is going to be the
father

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
but how is that determined how do you
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
well if there's a question there can be
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
you representative page
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you for
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the bill and i see
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's been some consideration for
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
costs associated with a pregnancy
 
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
costs associated with a pregnancy
including

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
prenatal the father would or the
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
alleged father would be
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for things like prenatal
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
vitamins and a 250 a month
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
payment i guess to the mother for
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
purposes of proper and adequate
 
00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.310 align:start position:0%
purposes of proper and adequate
nutrition

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
nutrition
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering to what extent you also
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
might have considered
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
other costs that might be associated
 
00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
other costs that might be associated
with

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
with
both

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
the time the duration of the pregnancy
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
and post-pregnancy for example
 
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.789 align:start position:0%
and post-pregnancy for example
um

00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know i know some some mothers that
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
can't work because
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
of their pregnancy there'd be a loss of
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
income there
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
and then i'm wondering
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
to what extent you consider perhaps i
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
mean could a child support
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
going forward after the birth of the
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
child could that be something
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the mother could petition the court
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the same proceeding
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
to do and then my in a related point
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
what if what i know under the american
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
rule of fees and courts
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
ace parties responsible for their own
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what happens in the event
 
00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:55.269 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what happens in the event
that

00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know the mother has to bear the
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
costs of going to court and then
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately she prevails
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
should the father be responsible for her
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees as well so it's
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
kind of my questions within that but
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
they concern the costs associated both
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
before and after the birth of the child
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually excellent questions and um
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
the the greater weight is being placed
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
the greater burden excuse me the greater
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
burden is being placed on the father as
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
he should be on the hook for
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
the expenses of this
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
i have no issues with that that's the
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
way it should be
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
child support or anything like that
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
after the birth
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
she's giving up the baby she has no
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
obligations to the baby after birth she
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
didn't want the baby he does
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
so she should not have any obligations
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
to the baby whatsoever after the child
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
is born now if you're suggesting that we
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to allow the father or
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
require excuse me require the father to
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
pay some sort of compensatory uh
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
costs of postpartum uh care i'm all in
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
favor of that let's let's let's put him
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
on the hook for that absolutely she went
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
through all the process the greater
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
burden on the on the of the of the
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
natural childbirthing process
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh let him let him pay for some time off
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
from work let him pay he's on the hook
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
for any any medical expenses not covered
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
by her insurance
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
as he should be
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
so if we want to amend this bill that
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
would require him to pay some some
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that period of time may be to
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
allow for postpartum care
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'd be all in favor of that that he
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
would that he would care but her
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
obligations to the child
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
are after the child is born she's under
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative corrigan
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
mr representative greeson um
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm uh looking at the bill and i don't
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
see any provisions for the uh women for
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
for the mother to specify uh
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
to prevent the uh
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent the uh
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
the supposed father from getting any
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
particular medical procedures like uh
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
such as a vasectomy or a uh
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
or even a gender reassignment surgery
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would be somewhat unusual
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
circumstance but um
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
so does this give the mother any control
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
alleged father's medical decisions
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't catch all of what you said
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
there however gender reassignment
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
surgery has absolutely nothing to do
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing to do with this
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
i guess first i want to congratulate you
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
i think this is a first
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of proposals related to
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
reproductive rights that have appeared
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
before this committee over the years
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
usually you know you say there's nothing
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
new under the sun and this might be in
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
something new and so i'd like to
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
congratulate you for that
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
thank you no no no i i i i i'm thinking
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
of the movie the croods where he says
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
they tried something new and died i hope
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's not a premonition you just had
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
i didn't quite hear that i'm sure it was
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
clever but i didn't quite hear that
 
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.750 align:start position:0%
clever but i didn't quite hear that
um

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
is as to exactly what the purpose
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill is um
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
i see what the process is but i don't
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
quite see
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
is the purpose to protect
 
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
is the purpose to protect
the

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.110 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
woman involved is the pro is the purpose
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of the biological
 
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of the biological
father

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
father
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
is the purpose to protect um
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
the fetus
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just not
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
sure and i wonder if you could help me
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is yes
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean that facetiously
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
again this is this is
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
this is a juggling act the state has to
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
balance between the interest in in
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
protecting the life of the of the of the
 
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.669 align:start position:0%
protecting the life of the of the of the
child

00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
as well as protecting the rights of the
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
mother and to date nothing has ever been
 
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.470 align:start position:0%
mother and to date nothing has ever been
done

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
considering the father
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
and so this brings that
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
piece into
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
the into the discussion now
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not just about protecting
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the rights of the father
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually about recognizing
 
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually about recognizing
that

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
men have the rights the fathers have
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
but how do we go about making sure that
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
those rights are recognized so the
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
purpose is there may be a man out there
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
who would love to raise this child
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
how many there are i have no idea nobody
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
knows how many
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
but there may be a man out there who
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
says i am the father of this child i
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
would like to raise this child as my own
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
if she doesn't want to so be it but i'm
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
how you know how terrible for a man to
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for his actions
 
00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:34.710 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for his actions
right

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
he's gonna the purpose is to to at least
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
codify in law and recognize
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
that fathers do have rights
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
though they may be of lesser weight
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
they do have some and so it's just to
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that those get recognized mr
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
mr could i just follow up a follow-up
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.069 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative greeson i've read this
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
bill i'm sure that i haven't read it as
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
often and as many times as you have
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
but i see nowhere in this bill language
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
if in fact the pregnancy because of
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
these actions were to come full term
 
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.430 align:start position:0%
these actions were to come full term
and

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a product of the
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy able to live outside of the
 
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
pregnancy able to live outside of the
mother

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
mother
 
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.510 align:start position:0%
mother
and

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.349 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
the father will assume
 
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.550 align:start position:0%
the father will assume
all

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.109 align:start position:0%
all
responsibilities

00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:38.150 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
for

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.829 align:start position:0%
for
raising

00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
raising
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that child
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
i see no indication anywhere in this
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the father's obligation
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
extends past the moment
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
of birth
 
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.069 align:start position:0%
of birth
and

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
as you say
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
your concern is to protect the fetus and
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
if you acknowledge that for whatever
 
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.109 align:start position:0%
if you acknowledge that for whatever
reason

00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
the the woman
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
chooses to end the pregnancy
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
and you want to
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
interfere with that
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there then be an obligation
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
to state who is going to be responsible
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
for raising
 
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.470 align:start position:0%
for raising
um

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
the results of this pregnancy that says
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
that he is the purpose for him
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
petitioning is because he wants to raise
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
the child as his own
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you might want to go
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
back and look at the language thank you
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative maclean
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a just a quick
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up on on the question i asked
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
earlier because i think there was some
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
confusion about the question what i'm
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
really looking at trying to determine is
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
what is the end result so there is a
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
process and it goes
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
in pretty good detail here about the
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
injunction process but you know
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
understanding your recognition of the
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
relative rights of the mother and the
 
00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
relative rights of the mother and the
father

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
father
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
is it the intent of this bill
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
the father is identified as the father
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
through dna which it kind of goes
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
through here
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
want to raise the child
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
the is it is it the intent of this bill
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
that that is grounds to stop the
 
00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:35.670 align:start position:0%
that that is grounds to stop the
abortion

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
that in itself and not some other
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
he is filing a petition
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
to prevent an abortion from taking place
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
in order that he may have the child to
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.390 align:start position:0%
that's it
okay

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative page i have another
 
00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:00.470 align:start position:0%
representative page i have another
question

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
as i read this
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
this question relates to personal
 
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
this question relates to personal
jurisdiction

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
over the over the mother as it in terms
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
of potentially bringing the mother here
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
if we had a scenario
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
where the conception happened in florida
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
with the mom is a floridian
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
and dad is a granite stater
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire court
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
could then have jurisdiction over the
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
mom who maybe never had
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
contacts in new hampshire is that
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
correct and if so
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that is some sort of
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
some sort of violation of a state's
 
00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:47.030 align:start position:0%
some sort of violation of a state's
rights

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the floridian
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you follow my question that is a
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
legal question that can get duked out at
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
within the state of new hampshire or
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
whatever that is that is a legal
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that i cannot answer
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
has a valid and reasonable interest
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
in protecting
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
life in the womb
 
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.150 align:start position:0%
life in the womb
these

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
and how does that happen
 
00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
and how does that happen
well

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
the father is a partner in procreation
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
the that's a natural
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
right of
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
both parties
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
to be recognized in that
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
and it also brings responsibility
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
to both parties
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
for the care and the raising of that
 
00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.829 align:start position:0%
for the care and the raising of that
child

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the case of abortion we have a
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
different circumstance here of course
 
00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:10.550 align:start position:0%
different circumstance here of course
because

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
if the child is aborted
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
well the state loses its uh
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
valid and reasonable interest
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
the child loses its life
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
and there's no further
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
action that can be done
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
by the father
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
the father has been silent
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
we hear about women's choice
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the right to abortion
 
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.550 align:start position:0%
and the right to abortion
and

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
we never hear anything about
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
the father's choice
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
and yet the father is an instrument in
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
this procreation
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
out of natural law
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
and out of
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the state's reasonable and valid
 
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.190 align:start position:0%
the state's reasonable and valid
interest

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
the father represents standing
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
for that state interest as well has his
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
own interest as a father
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
and the state interest is important
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
and the woman's interests is important
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
and the father's interest is important
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
is why we need this bill
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
even though we haven't expressly
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
made that
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
affirmation of the father's rights
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
why because it's part of natural law
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
it's been understood from eons
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
that of
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
father and mother are participants in
 
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.230 align:start position:0%
father and mother are participants in
creation

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
creation
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
and you know by that very same natural
 
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
and you know by that very same natural
law

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
as recognized by
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
the laws in our country and democracy
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
parents are responsible for raising
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
their children for their safety and care
 
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.150 align:start position:0%
their children for their safety and care
so

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
when the father is allowed the right
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
to have a say
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
it prevents the abortion
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
and he assumes that responsibility
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
for custodian care
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
safety raising the child in the case
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
that the mother may not want to
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
participate in that
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
but those are other things beyond this
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill is establishing a father's right
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're not going to stretch out
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
into the whole entire life and aspect of
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're protecting the father's right to
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
have a say
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
to give him a chance to preserve the
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
life that he's created
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
not only for himself but his state
 
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
not only for himself but his state
interest

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
while we
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
don't have a legal
 
00:43:55.839 --> 00:43:58.150 align:start position:0%
don't have a legal
written

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
testimony someplace about father's
 
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.230 align:start position:0%
testimony someplace about father's
rights

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
this is a derived right out of natural
 
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
this is a derived right out of natural
law

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
and the way our culture works in caring
 
00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:10.150 align:start position:0%
and the way our culture works in caring
for

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
children and raising them properly
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
and other aspects of law
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
will come into play
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
if that obligation is not fulfilled
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
but this one
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
focuses on
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
the right of the father to have a say to
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
have a participation and so
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to please vote or to pass
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
on hb 1181
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions for representative stapleton
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
mr representative stapleton um
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
obviously once the child is born the
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
relationship between the parents will be
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat different than it usually is so
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
does this bill do anything
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so even after the child obviously
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
once a child is born he or she is no
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
longer an unborn child so you know the
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
state's interest in it is different but
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
there's still a valid state interest so
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
what what does this do to make sure that
 
00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:09.510 align:start position:0%
what what does this do to make sure that
uh

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
child is uh properly cared for that the
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
father and the mother meet their
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm having difficulty my hearing aids
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
are low on battery and okay i'm having
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
trouble discerning your quote
 
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.550 align:start position:0%
trouble discerning your quote
once

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
once
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
in due course if you prevent the mother
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
having abortion the unborn child will
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
eventually become a born child and the
 
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.710 align:start position:0%
eventually become a born child and the
state

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
will still have a valid interest maybe a
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
different interest than while the child
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
is unborn so what does does this bill do
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
anything in order to
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
what happens after the child is born
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
that the child is properly cared for
 
00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:56.470 align:start position:0%
that the child is properly cared for
after

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.589 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
if the injunction is granted for uh
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
stopping the abortion on the father's
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
appeal to the court
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh and as and it's successful the second
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
part of the bill talks about uh the
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
incurring of cost and responsibility for
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
costs and expenses
 
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
costs and expenses
um

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
but again the this the bill has a narrow
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
focus here and it does not extend into
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
the life of the child
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%

for care of the child once born

that child has rights
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
under the 14th amendment among others
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%

people we we take care of our children
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
and if the state has to step in because
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's not happening
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know we have provisions and statutes
 
00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.829 align:start position:0%
you know we have provisions and statutes

law to
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that that child is protected i
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
mean that's what family court is
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to do are there are there other
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions for representative stapleton
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative chase did you have a
 
00:47:14.319 --> 00:47:16.630 align:start position:0%
representative chase did you have a
question

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
i i understand the concept of what
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do in giving dad's
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
rights but it just doesn't seem like
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's fully completed i don't see
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere again as
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative smith was saying that
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
this has anything to do with the mom
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually almost like an adoption giving
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
over the rights of her child and not
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
being involved in the children the
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
child's upbringing
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to strictly do this to
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
forefathers to be able to take
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
their child that the mom may not want
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
it it just doesn't seem to have all of
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
the the information that's needed
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
um also and you've got in here about you
 
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.790 align:start position:0%
um also and you've got in here about you
know

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.589 align:start position:0%
know
the

00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
line 23 on page four the mama requests
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
to issue a restraining order against the
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
father whatever conditions the court
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
judge seems appropriate
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
why would a mother have to put a
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
restraining order against a father and
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
then feel that that father was capable
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
to raise their child or a child doesn't
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
even matter if she doesn't want it
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's a violent person
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes where are all these parts
 
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.069 align:start position:0%
yes where are all these parts
for

00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:39.349 align:start position:0%
for
yeah

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
i i think i know where you're going with
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
that i'm having trouble hearing but i
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
think i got the gist of it um
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't prevent cooperation
 
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.750 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't prevent cooperation
after

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the case of an injunction and a
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
abortion is prohibited
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill doesn't prevent cooperation
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
of those parents
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
who when a child is born now become
 
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
who when a child is born now become
responsible

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
and just like if there was an
 
00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:06.710 align:start position:0%
and just like if there was an
uncontested

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
uncontested
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
birth and in a normal fashion where
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
people got together and
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
got married and had children
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
again this bill is a narrow focus
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
because we haven't recognized the rights
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
of the father to participate in this
 
00:49:21.599 --> 00:49:23.589 align:start position:0%
of the father to participate in this
question

00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:24.710 align:start position:0%
question
and

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you wanted to extend the
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and duties that we
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
would have a bill that contained volumes
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
instead of focused on the right of the
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
father to participate in the transaction
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
once again
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
when that child is born a child has
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
rights under the constitution as an
 
00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:47.589 align:start position:0%
rights under the constitution as an
individual

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
and there are obligations for those
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
parents or that parent if there's only
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
one involved
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that child is cared for
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a safe and
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
in a good manner okay
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.790 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
stapleton

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
stapleton
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
um you've used the term transaction a
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
couple of times and i'm wondering if you
 
00:50:17.839 --> 00:50:18.549 align:start position:0%
couple of times and i'm wondering if you
could

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
tell me what which piece of this is the
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
transaction i'm not sure
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
adoption would be
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
a most desirable thing in the case that
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
in this action were not capable
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
or not willing
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
adoptions happen all the time and there
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
are so many people out there that are
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
looking for child
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
for children they can't have their own
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
so adoption is an avenue for
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
those parents to have and enjoy and
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
raise a child as well as to relieve the
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
obligation for
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
the people who did not maybe intend to
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
have a child or did not want to have a
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
child but through the natural occurrence
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
pregnancy occurs
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
but regardless of how the pregnancy
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
occurs by will
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
or by accident
 
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.309 align:start position:0%
or by accident
um

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
that that life that's human life in the
 
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.470 align:start position:0%
that that life that's human life in the
womb

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
womb
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
and okay there may be a day when that
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
human life is declared right to life
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the moment of conception there are
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
several bills
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
that have been furthered in the federal
 
00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.069 align:start position:0%
that have been furthered in the federal
system

00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
life at conception act
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
now we don't know when that might occur
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
or if it's going to occur
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
we have to honor
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
human life
 
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.270 align:start position:0%
human life
and

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's from
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
before birth during birth and then after
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
birth and
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
again if we were to expound on every
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
obligation that's already established in
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
culture and law we'd have volumes in
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
this bill instead of three pages
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%

00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
a couple of years got pregnant by my
 
00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
a couple of years got pregnant by my
husband

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
and decided i didn't want to be stuck
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i want to get rid of that product of
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
conception which as we now know would
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
have been a baby and that baby would
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
have been 33 years old this year
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i regret it every day
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
came to me and said
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
cause i told him
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i told him i was gonna abort the
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
he said please let me have the baby and
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
i will raise the baby and you don't have
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
to have any
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
dealings with me or the baby
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
but i was selfish
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
and i made a horrible decision
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
it was the worst decision i've ever made
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
in my entire life
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
i regretted to this day
 
00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:36.390 align:start position:0%
i regretted to this day
it's

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
terrible what i did
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
he had every right as the father of that
 
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.950 align:start position:0%
he had every right as the father of that
child

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
to have that child
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
to raise that child to have that child
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
in his life
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
whether i chose to have that child in my
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
life or not
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
it was wrong of me
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
he had rights
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i told him you don't have any rights
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's my body and i'm going to do with it
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
what i want well guess what
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else's body
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
i had removed
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else i had taken ripped out of
 
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
somebody else i had taken ripped out of
me

00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that was also another little story
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
i'll be telling you guys about later
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
but that father
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
had the right
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
to have to be a father to that child
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
that i killed and i just want you to
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
know that had i listened to him and had
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
he had the right to stop me i may things
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
might have been different i might have
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
had a chance to rethink it maybe we
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
would have had an agreement at that
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
point but no
 
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.829 align:start position:0%
point but no
no

00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
it was wrong
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
the father has rights and i i'm here in
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
support of this bill thank you for
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
hearing me and i have to go
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
today my name is frank knack i'm the
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
 
00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:25.589 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
hampshire

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we are here in strong opposition to
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we've talked a lot about
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
about uh you know what this bill could
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
and couldn't do there's been some great
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions from members i'd just like to
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know dig in and get away from the
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
theory and talk about what this bill
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
would look like in practice
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
in practice this legislation means that
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
survivors of abusive relationships could
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
have their abortion blocked by their
 
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.390 align:start position:0%
have their abortion blocked by their
abuser

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
abuser
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
under this bill a victim of incest would
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
bear the burden of costs to have dna
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
testing to show that it was in fact
 
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
testing to show that it was in fact
incest

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
incest
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation you know as we all know
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
we've talked about abortion is safe
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
legal medical procedure it is legal in
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire up to 24 weeks
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
this legislation would criminalize
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
people for seeking a constitutionally
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
protected medical procedure
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
under this bill injunction could be
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
they the way it would work is basically
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
anyone could claim paternity there's a
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
temporary injunction put on the person
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
within the pregnant person would not
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
have the ability to exercise their
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to abortion a safe
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
legal medical procedure
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
because one person made a claim and then
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
if that person's claim turns out to be
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
false under this bill there is zero
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
penalty for bringing a false claim
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
in addition i think as we just heard one
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the co-sponsors of the bill
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
i think this the intent of this bill is
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
crystal clear it's a backdoor attempt to
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
further restrict the fundamental right
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
to abortion in new hampshire you know as
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
of january 1 of this year new hampshire
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
had been one of the states where you
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
know the fundamental right to abortion
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
was something that we all value
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
as as granite staters and as of january
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
1st of this year uh there's a parental
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
consent law there's restrictions on
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
funding there's a 24-week ban there is a
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory ultrasound law this bill would
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
be yet another attempt to further
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
restrict the fundamental right to
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
abortion in new hampshire
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we think that's that's deeply
 
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.710 align:start position:0%
and we think that's that's deeply
problematic

00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
in addition i think the initial sponsor
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill talked about this bill as
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
something that protects safety and i
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
think again the facts don't bear that
 
00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:30.950 align:start position:0%
think again the facts don't bear that
out

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would do would be to
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
potentially delay someone seeking an
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
abortion uh if they're seeking it for
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
some type of medical reason that would
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
then be delayed and further further put
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
the jeopardize the the pregnant person's
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh health in that situation so again
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
i think the the claims made by
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
proponents are
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
quite transparent what they're actually
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
attempting to do and i urge this
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%

00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
a man came in through my window
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
put his hand on my neck
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
i had to face the the consequences of
 
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.230 align:start position:0%
i had to face the the consequences of
that

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
let me tell you the first thing
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
that a person who's been raped thinks
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
about is whether that person
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
will come back
 
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.549 align:start position:0%
will come back
again

00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
makes that nightmare
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
there's no way that somebody who has
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
been raped
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
should have to face
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
this situation without being able to
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
on her own
 
00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.630 align:start position:0%
on her own
terms

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
terms
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
not file a petition
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
in addition the other deeply flawed part
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
it gives
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
all the weight to the father
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that says
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
that you will consider anything that the
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
woman wants
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
in this petition
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
just reminds me of the nightmare that i
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
live every night
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
for the last 40 some years
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
and it cannot be voted into law
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if i've repeated anything
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
before but
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
the sound in this i i am extremely hard
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
of hearing if you have any questions
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
please speak close slowly and clearly
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
hello my name is josie pinto and i'm the
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
founder and executive director of the
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom fund of new
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're an organization working
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
to reduce barriers to abortion access
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
for all granite staters through direct
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
funding of abortion care providing
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
logistical support and providing
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
information and education relating to
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
reproductive health
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
i'm here to express my strong opposition
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
to hb 1181
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
when i first read this bill i was
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
horrified i felt sick
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
to think that there is any possibility
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
that someone other than a pregnant
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
person could be more entitled to what
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
happens to their own body would be
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
setting the most harmful legal precedent
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
i can imagine
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
it would open up the gates to more
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
legislation that further strips us from
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
access to making decisions about our own
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
bodies the decision to terminate a
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
pregnancy should always be up to the
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
person who is pregnant and anything less
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
than that is utter cruelty
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
as someone who works every single day to
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
break down barriers to abortion access
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
let me tell you there are plenty of
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
barriers in place already
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
between the cost of the procedure
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
needing transportation taking time off
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
work and securing child care
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
more than half of abortion parents are
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
already parents already
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
it can be incredibly difficult for
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
people to access abortion care
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislation like hb 1181 adds
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and morally egregious
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
hurdles to care that is already so
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to access this bill wouldn't
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
even require proof that the person suing
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the father
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
only if the pregnant person denies
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
paternity would a dna test be required
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
meaning anyone could initiate a lawsuit
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
and slow down the process for obtaining
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
an abortion as i read this bill i was
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
shocked to see that a pregnant person
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
misses their court date the injunction
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
prohibiting them from obtaining an
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
abortion is automatically granted
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is a blatant denial of due process
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
for pregnant people and a
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
major civil rights and human rights
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
major civil rights and human rights
violation

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
there can be so many barriers to
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
responding to court summons and the
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
court process would significantly stall
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
someone from accessing abortion in a
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
timely manner abortion is a time
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
sensitive issue the longer a patient has
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
to wait for an abortion the more it
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
costs and the more difficult accessing
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
it becomes not to mention this bill
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even require the pregnant
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
person to live in new hampshire but
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
would still force them to travel here
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
and if they already had had the abortion
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the injunction gets granted the
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
court could hold them in civil or
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
criminal contempt even though they did
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
nothing illegal
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
none of this is okay the strategy here
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
is clear create as many barriers to
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
access as possible to delay care and
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
then ban abortion later in pregnancy
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
the bill would enshrine in law
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
patriarchal violence and reduce pregnant
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire to mere vessels
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
with little to no civil rights for this
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
reason and so many others we strongly
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to recommend this
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill as inexpedient to legislate and
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
affirm the civil rights and bodily
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
autonomy of pregnant people in new

going to strike those from my testimony
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to respond to this simple
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
idea that has been presented by the
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
built sponsors
 
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
built sponsors
that

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.430 align:start position:0%
that
know

01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
that it is not established in law
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
that the father should have any rights
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the abortion decision
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
i stand before you as a person holding a
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
law degree as a member of the new
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire bar association to say that
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
the law of the land since 1973
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
has said that there is a fundamental
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
right to choose without
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
excessive government interference in
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
that decision and
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
and since 1976 united states supreme
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
court decided in planned parenthood
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
of missouri versus danforth that exact
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
balancing act between a father's rights
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
and a
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
and a pregnant person's rights to make
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%

the court held
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
in that danforth case that spousal
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
consent or in this case a partner's
 
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.390 align:start position:0%
consent or in this case a partner's
consent

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
for a pregnant person to seek an
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
abortion does not comport with the
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
standards enunciated in a row versus
 
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
standards enunciated in a row versus
wade

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
wade
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
and that a state cannot delegate to a
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
spouse the veto power which the state
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
itself is absolutely and totally
 
01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
itself is absolutely and totally
prohibited

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
from exercising during the first try
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
man's trimester of pregnancy
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
the court reasoned that a woman's right
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
to privacy in her medical decisions must
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
be a paramount and must be paramount to
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
that of her spouse or partner
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
and also the simple fact that the
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant person is more directly
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
affected by that pregnancy clearly the
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
court stated both prospective parents
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
have an interest in the decision
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
but when the two disagree on the matter
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
of abortion only one partner's position
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
can prevail
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
that of the pregnant person
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
because the balance weighs in their
 
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.950 align:start position:0%
because the balance weighs in their
favor

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
favor
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
preventing the potential father in this
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
case or husband from vetoing the choice
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill has extreme implications
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
causes and begs the question what other
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
health care decisions will require a
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
spouse or partner's consent
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
deeply deeply concerning thoughts here
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
what other private decisions of new
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens may the state
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
override as well
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think these are very dark
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals and
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know there is current and
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
well-established law that speaks to this
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
balancing act that the sponsors have
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted as a member of the bar i
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
urge you to seek legal counsel
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if you don't please be able 15
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
seconds please be advised
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
can you wrap up your testimony i am
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
that litigation will follow it will be
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
very costly for the state
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
and in addition to the current ongoing
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
litigation the state is okay paying for
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
it this will follow
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it will not be easy to
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
to um fold into the um
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%

the committee for taking my testimony
today

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is sophia

biandalilo i'm 15. i'm from manchester
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire high school democrats
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
i submitted my testimony via the remote
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
sign in ahead of the hearing and i also
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a physical copy
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire high school democrats
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
urged the committee to recommend that hb
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
1181 be inexpedient to legislate um
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
outside of the issue of abortion there
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
are quite a few issues of this
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that make it ill-advised
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of what stance members of
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
this committee might otherwise have on
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
abortion in general
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
hb 1181 would put several barriers in
 
01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.070 align:start position:0%
hb 1181 would put several barriers in
place

01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
through long and complicated legal
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
obligations which would make attaining
 
01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.390 align:start position:0%
obligations which would make attaining
justice

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
essentially impossible for a pregnant
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
person this would enable as some others
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
have already discussed
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
an abusive partner to force a pregnant
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
person to undergo a painful and unwanted
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
pregnancy for at least 24 weeks against
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
their will even if the court ultimately
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
decides that terminating that pregnancy
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
would have been appropriate in the first
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
place it's important to consider or
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
think about this bill the reality of the
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire family court system and
 
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
the court system in general
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
family courts are constantly overwhelmed
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
and after filing a complaint with the
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
court it's likely that a petitioner
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
would have to wait several months for a
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
hearing in any other case
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
and if mediation is required that
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
usually is additional months onto the
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
timeline and then dna testing is
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
obviously another possible delay um and
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
again i just want to reiterate that even
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
though there is a deadline of 24 weeks
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
meeting that deadline is probably not
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
very practical because of the delays in
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
the court system already
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and the pregnant person is still forced
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
to carry that fetus for at least 24
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
weeks even if the decision is made in
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
that timeline and then on top of that if
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
the decision is made in 23 or 24 weeks
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
the pregnant person would still have to
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
schedule an appointment to actually
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
receive services which usually involves
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
consultation and a number of other
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
appointments which might push them past
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
the deadline even if the decision is
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
made within 23 weeks so it still might
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
be an abortion ban
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
in general um
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
and then in addition obtaining legal
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
services and continuing to pay for them
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
over the course of the proceedings um
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
would be an undue burden on somebody who
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
is most likely already struggling
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
financially if they are seriously
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
considering terminating their pregnancy
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe this bill requires
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
the petitioner to pay for those services
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
legal services
 
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.390 align:start position:0%
legal services
um

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
and although some people
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
some previous speakers have stated that
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
the father carries all responsibility
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
for the pregnancy if the injunction is
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
granted they don't have to give birth
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay as far as bill
 
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay as far as bill
states

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the tens of thousands of dollars it
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes costs
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
to actually deliver a baby in an
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
emergency room or hospital and also
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
there is evidence that being forced to
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
carry a child or a fetus
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
that somebody doesn't want can have
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
lasting effects on their mental health
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life including um
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
higher rates of eviction higher rates of
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
poverty higher rates of depression and
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
so even if the father does take
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility after birth there's still
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
15 seconds sorry for the mother years
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
into the future after that um also
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
sorry just wrap up if you yeah yeah um
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature basically by passing
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would be um taking power away
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
from the courts and forcing them to
 
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.709 align:start position:0%
from the courts and forcing them to
sorry

01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would probably take
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
power away from the courts because of
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
the various delays that it would impose
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it would lead to outcomes that would
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
be against the judge's best interests so
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire high school democrats
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
would urge the committee to recover
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
recommend hb1181 being expedient
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
allegedly thank you ms mandellio
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from his
 
01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from his
vandalia

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is liz canada i'm
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
the advocacy manager at planned
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
parenthood new hampshire action fund and
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood of northern new
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
england we oppose house bill 1181 house
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill 1181 is an outrageous and offensive
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill meant to shame burden and degrade
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
women seeking abortion care it is
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
insulting and a danger to women
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
particularly those in abusive
 
01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.229 align:start position:0%
particularly those in abusive
relationships

01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
in house bill 1181 any man without
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
needing to prove paternity could file a
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
petition with the court which would
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
immediately stop a woman from being able
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
a court hearing would be scheduled up to
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
two weeks later
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
and if the woman lives out of state
 
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
which this bill allows
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
she would need to be physically present
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
in the courthouse for that hearing or
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
else somehow the state of new hampshire
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to prohibit her from
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
having an abortion
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
it is unclear in this bill as to how the
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire would be able to
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
at the hearing two weeks later then the
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
woman can say this person is not the
 
01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:45.270 align:start position:0%
woman can say this person is not the
father

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
father
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
and then there would be required dna
 
01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
and then there would be required dna
testing

01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
to be clear dna testing for parental
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
origin of a fetus cannot happen before
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
nine weeks of pregnancy
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
so under this bill medication abortion
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
which can only happen until the 11th
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
week of pregnancy would be essentially
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
banned for women in new hampshire
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
because this legal process could not
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
resolve before the 11th week
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
between the hearing and the tests and
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
the testing the legal process alone
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
would delay a woman's constitutionally
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
protected right to safe legal abortion
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
by a month i'll remind the committee
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
that abortion care becomes less
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
accessible the longer it is delayed
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
if the pregnancy is a result of rape the
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
woman would have already needed to
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
report the rape before her rapist goes
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
to court to file a petition to stop her
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
from having an abortion and if the
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is a result of incest the
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
financial burden of obtaining dna proof
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
falls on her
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is a blatantly sexist attack
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
on women
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
allowing a woman's body to be controlled
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
by an abusive partner by the judicial
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
system and by the legislature
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
as granite staters we aren't actually
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
free if we can't make our own decisions
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
about our own bodies lives and futures
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
whether that is saying no to unwanted
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
sexual advances
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
no to an unintended pregnancy or yes to
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
becoming a parent the decision about
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether and when to become a parent is
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
one of the most important life decisions
 
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
we make when people can make decisions
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
that are best for their lives families
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
thrive and we build communities where
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
each of us can participate with dignity
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
and equality women deserve to make these
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
decisions for themselves with influence
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
from their loved ones and health care
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
providers our state should not allow
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
judges rapists sexual partners or anyone
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions for women this
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill is an extreme attack on abortion
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
and bodily 15 seconds and it has no
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
place in the legislature we urge you to
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
vote in expedient to legislate thank you
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for miss canada
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%

01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
good morning chair gordon and members of
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you so much for
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony this morning
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
my name is laura lee godfrey and i'm 17
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
years old from portsmouth new hampshire
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i come before you today in
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 1181
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
allowing the biological father of an
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
unborn child to petition the court for
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
an injunction
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
my primary objection to this bill stems
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
from the fact that it flagrantly
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
dismisses a woman's bodily autonomy
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would legally force women to
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
hold on to unwanted pregnancies and that
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
is a violation of a woman's
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected personal
 
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.709 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected personal
rights

01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
previous speakers have said that this
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill is meant to give men a right in
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
this process while still weighing
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
relatively a woman's right higher
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
but this bill in filing an injunction
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
goes against the woman's decision and
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
holds the father's right to a greater
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
weight so if you believe these previous
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
speaker's sentiments you have to itl
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to set an efficient
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
time frame under which the father's
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
petition must be addressed but there is
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
no guarantee that it will be followed in
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
fact it's probably more likely than not
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
that this would be the case
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we are already
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
experiencing an extreme case backlog and
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
judge shortage and abortion is a time
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
sensitive issue
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
fetuses don't wait for a court tape to
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
become viable and as a result anyone who
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
claims paternity could then have the
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
power to decide a woman's pregnancy
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the event an injunction is granted if
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy poses an imminent threat
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
to the life of the pregnant person an
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
appeal still has to go through the judge
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
which could then cause dangerous delays
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
in their health care
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is gambling against
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy with the health and safety
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
of pregnant new hampshire citizens
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
to give men rights over a body that
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
isn't theirs
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
genetics teaches us that sexual
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
reproduction results in a baby that ends
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
up possessing 50 percent of the father's
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
genetics and 50 of the mothers
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
but this bill ignores that that fetus is

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
abortion is already a stressful costly
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
and incredibly personal decision in of
 
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
and incredibly personal decision in of
itself

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
the bill language specification
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
highlighting how a pregnant person must
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
attend all medical appointments to
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy in
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
the case an injunction is granted places
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
further scrutiny on pregnant individuals
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
in spite of potential health
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
complications that could arise
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
if they suffer a pregnancy a pregnancy
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
loss later down the road this bill
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
creates an implication that unless the
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant person did everything they
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
could to save the pregnancy they are at
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
risk of violating the injunction
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
subsequently we see that hb 1181
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
blatantly disregards maternal health at
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
all costs
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
and finally this bill ignores the
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
traumatic backgrounds that can influence
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant individuals to seek abortions
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%

01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would only enable their
 
01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.149 align:start position:0%
this bill would only enable their

01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
all hb 1181 is trying to do is control
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
women if you vote to pass this bill you
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be voting to explicitly hurt women
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
i don't think i've ever seen a more
ludicrous

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
ludicrous
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion bill
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
to claim to be
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
the father of a pregnancy
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
prior to any scientific
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
evidence of paternity
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
that means that any of us males in this
 
01:19:57.679 --> 01:19:58.709 align:start position:0%
that means that any of us males in this
room

01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
could claim
 
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.830 align:start position:0%
could claim
fatherhood

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
fatherhood
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
in another woman's pregnancy and without
 
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
in another woman's pregnancy and without
penalty

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
this bill has no penalty for that claim
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
if it's not true
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
practically speaking this law would
 
01:20:14.719 --> 01:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
practically speaking this law would
delay

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
delay
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
a woman's termination
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
up to over a month
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
making it impossible to do the
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
termination early in pregnancy when it's
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
safest when it can be done medically
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
when it can be done
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
early with a small uterus that's easily
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
easy to empty i wish i could show each
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
of you the difference between
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
terminating a pregnancy at six to eight
 
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
terminating a pregnancy at six to eight
weeks

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
versus 12 to 14 weeks
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
this law would put
 
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.870 align:start position:0%
this law would put
women

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
a woman's health at risk
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
if a woman is choosing to terminate her
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy she obviously conceived
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
against her will
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
where is the responsibility of the male
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
who didn't use any birth control
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
in fact to the extreme it could be a
 
01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.229 align:start position:0%
in fact to the extreme it could be a
male

01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
male
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
who raped her
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and yet he's still given the right
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
to stop her abortion delay her
 
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.590 align:start position:0%
to stop her abortion delay her
abortion

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
come on
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is absolutely ridiculous
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
it's creating an obstacle
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
making a woman's personal decision
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the bequest of an irresponsible male
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
a male who doesn't carry the pregnancy a
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
male who doesn't deliver
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
the baby
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
and very frequently doesn't support the
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
mom and baby
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
after the birth
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
if we are so concerned about males
 
01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
if we are so concerned about males
rights

01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
we should also have a bill
 
01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
we should also have a bill
that

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
would allow the biologic
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
father to petition
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
the court 15 seconds to require
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
a pregnant woman have an abortion
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
that bill obviously doctor if you could
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
wrap up your testimony would be no more
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
outrageous than 1181 i cannot imagine
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
any of you
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
not opposing this bill
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
today i have two more people who have
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak and
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's important we take note of
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
where we are as a state and as a country
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
it is getting harder to make ends meet
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
how do we properly
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
how do we raise children properly
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
when we as a country
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't provide paid parental leave
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
health care is not affordable in this
 
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:44.470 align:start position:0%
health care is not affordable in this
country

01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
welfare is extremely frowned upon
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
yet we're living in a state that hasn't
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
raised minimum wage in 13 years
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
or that's yeah that's under half my life
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
but you get it
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of living has been exponential
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
we don't support affordable college
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have affordable housing
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is all correlated to raising a
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
child in a healthy environment
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
if i were to get pregnant
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
if i were to be placed in this position
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
i could not provide the best quality of
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
i think this is a shared decision meant
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
for the woman and the male not the
 
01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:39.189 align:start position:0%
for the woman and the male not the
governments

01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of thousands of kids
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think it is also worthwhile to point
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
out that there can be life-threatening
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
health complications with some
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancies that could endanger the
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
like others said where is the woman's
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
women have just recently gained equal
 
01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
women have just recently gained equal
rights

01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
women used to not be able to open their
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
own bank account
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
and as others pointed out
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
is there any obligation for the father
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
to stay in the picture after birth
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
then so should universal health care
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
child care and tuition free college
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
that would be a start that would be
 
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.830 align:start position:0%
that would be a start that would be
pro-life

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
pro-life
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from his
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
and the last card i have is for
 
01:25:46.159 --> 01:25:56.310 align:start position:0%
and the last card i have is for
ameristolin

01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chair gordon thank you to
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
members of the judiciary committee for
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
hearing me today my name is maris
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
tolland i'm a resident physician in
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
obstetrics and gynecology
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
specializing in reproductive health i'm
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
also a resident of new hampshire
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
this bill makes me sick to my stomach
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
as a physician in women's health who
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
sees these issues every day the first
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
fear that evokes for me is that of
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
intimate partner violence
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to ponder a hypothetical
 
01:26:23.199 --> 01:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to ponder a hypothetical
scenario

01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
a 13 year old is sexually and physically
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
abused by her father she becomes
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
pregnant but she doesn't find out until
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
she's 10 weeks along
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
or maybe 14 weeks along or maybe 21
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
weeks along
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
periods can be pretty irregular when
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
you're pre-menopausal or pre-adolescent
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
her mother finds out she removes her
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
from the home
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
they make the challenging decision to
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
seek an abortion
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
but the biological father also her
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
abuser petitions the court to stop her i
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
understand that this bill makes a point
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
of denying injunctions in the case of
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
incest but due to waiting for delays in
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
the court verifying dna testing which
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
can occur before nine weeks of pregnancy
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
and routine delays because of short
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
staffing in our state
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
she progresses far enough in pregnancy
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
that she no longer has the resources or
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
potentially the legal option to undergo
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
this procedure
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
here's another scenario
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
25 year old she's in an increasingly
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
abusive marriage the last time she
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
became pregnant
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
with her husband she miscarried because
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
he beat her
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
she didn't report it to the police
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
because she was afraid so he doesn't
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
have a promoting record she's trying to
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
save up enough money to leave him and
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
she finds out she's pregnant again she
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to tie
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh have this pregnancy tired to her
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
husband because when she was pregnant
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
the last time he threatened to kill her
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
did you know that the number one cause
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
of death in pregnant women his homicide
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
she makes the difficult choice to have
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
an abortion but her husband finds out
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
and petitions the court she know that he
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is about control as others
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
have said specifically a man's ability
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
to control a woman's body
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
the idea that any man
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
could petition the court to be able to
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit a person from
 
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
prohibit a person from
achieving

01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
achieving
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
safe and essential medical services
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
is appalling
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't feel like i need to reiterate
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
the eloquent testimony that others have
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
given today
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
but i just want to add my voice to say
 
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill limits access to a safe
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
and an essential medical service and it
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
sends a very dangerous and a very sexist
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
and oppressive message about our state
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
this should be opposed
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
any questions for the doctor
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
sigmund thank you for your testimony
 
01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:45.189 align:start position:0%
sigmund thank you for your testimony

today
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who hasn't spoken who
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
and we will open the hearing on house
 
01:29:02.239 --> 01:29:04.189 align:start position:0%
and we will open the hearing on house

bill
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
1477 this is an act prohibiting
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
abortions after detection of a fetal
 
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.830 align:start position:0%
abortions after detection of a fetal

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i will call upon the prime sponsor
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative testament to provide his
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
testimony again my intention would be to
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
give the sponsors of the bill five
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
minutes and then everyone else three
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
minutes and speaking here today
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
i do have
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
quite a number of cards
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative testament thank you
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
my name is for the record my name is
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
dave testerman i'm a representative from
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to introduce
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
a bill fairly simple
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
on the field on when
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
you can't have an abortion
 
01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:53.350 align:start position:0%
you can't have an abortion
1477.

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
bills that have been
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
put forth
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
that are somewhat complicated
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
this one takes a
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
stethoscope to determine whether or not
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a heartbeat
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
i would rather see a bill
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
at conception
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
i wasn't really happy with 24 weeks or
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to pick it
 
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.709 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to pick it
i

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
would like to keep
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
they

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's not really a pro-life bill it's an
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
anti-pro-death bill
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
i i believe that we need
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
to to have a bill
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
that clearly states
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
we do not approve of murder in the womb
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%

01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question this morning
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
um can you
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not a doctor and i don't pretend
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be i'm a legislator and i try to keep
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
um but in your research leading up to
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill can you tell me at what stage
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
a fetus can survive outside of the
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
uterus and whether that bears any
 
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.790 align:start position:0%
uterus and whether that bears any
relation

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
relation
 
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.629 align:start position:0%
relation
to

01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
what might be considered to be a fetal
 
01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.310 align:start position:0%
what might be considered to be a fetal
heartbeat

01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't believe that has anything
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
with this bill this bill isn't about
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
viability or anything else i don't know
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
what that is i'm an engineer
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's thank you very much for your candor
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware of any
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
states that have similar legislation
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
like this on the books right now
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that there is one in texas
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
that uh has some version of this
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
other states four or five i don't know
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
what they what which states they are but
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
i know texas there's a
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill that is sitting in front of the
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.030 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative

co-sponsor was it your intention to
speak

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee i'm walt stapleton i am the
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
third ward clermont rep
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
sullivan county district five and i am a
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and supporter
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
of h.b 1477
 
01:33:03.679 --> 01:33:05.990 align:start position:0%
of h.b 1477
the

01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
protection of life after detection of
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
why not
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
24 weeks efficient
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
as we
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
i've heard and read that
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
most abortions occur in the first and
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
second trimester
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
so this bill is intended to afford
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
protections to those
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
early life
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's linked of course to the detection
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
of heartbeat
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
the fetus the young baby is
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
coming to life
 
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.910 align:start position:0%
coming to life
and

01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
there have been over
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
centuries various measures of
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
how we
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
the old term quicken for instance
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
but we have scientific methods now we
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
have the wonderful
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
instrument of ultrasound which can take
 
01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:19.750 align:start position:0%
instrument of ultrasound which can take
a

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
inside look see
 
01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:23.110 align:start position:0%
inside look see
at

01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
how the the baby is doing in the womb
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
detect problems
 
01:34:29.679 --> 01:34:31.189 align:start position:0%
detect problems
detect

01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
detect
 
01:34:31.199 --> 01:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
detect
malformations

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
malformations
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
and so we can actually take a peek
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
inside the womb
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the life that is resident
 
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.070 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the life that is resident
there

01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
living and growing
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
and hopefully to be destined to become
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
a live person
 
01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
a live person
born

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
born
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
with all the rights that you and i enjoy
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
and all the privileges
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
and all of the opportunities that life
 
01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.830 align:start position:0%
and all of the opportunities that life
is

01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
about those of us who
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the providence of a
 
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.229 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the providence of a
creator

01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
creator
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
understand that the process of life in
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the womb is necessary for
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
our culture and our populations to grow
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
and to flourish
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
to cut that life off prematurely
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
is to deny those opportunities that
 
01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.390 align:start position:0%
is to deny those opportunities that
individual

01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that child to
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
grow and
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
be fulfilled
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
in life and it's
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
many aspects just like we all here
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
today are enjoying because
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
our mothers and fathers
 
01:35:41.199 --> 01:35:42.390 align:start position:0%
our mothers and fathers
protected

01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
the life in the womb
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
it has a certain sanctity
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
we feel that the marker of the heartbeat
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
is at least a good
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
point at which
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
to effect that early protection
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
we we would like to see that
 
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.109 align:start position:0%
we we would like to see that
happen

01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
and there are other states that have
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
done similar initiatives
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
for eight weeks maybe even six weeks and
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
some at 15 weeks and
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
some at 20 weeks
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
pain-capable act for instance is one
 
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.030 align:start position:0%
pain-capable act for instance is one
but

01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
we we prefer in the writing of this bill
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
to afford early protection as much as
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
possible we feel the eighth
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
week with the heartbeat
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
is a valid
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
and reasonable
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
marker for that protection and so i ask
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
you to support
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
1477 is ought to pass
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and are there any questions
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
xenon thanks for your testimony thank
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that i don't see any other sponsors
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill here so we'll
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
move on
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
again and restrict testimony to three
 
01:37:16.639 --> 01:37:17.669 align:start position:0%

01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
medical experts like the dhmc ob gyns
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
who live in my district
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
the definition of fetal heartbeat in the
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
proposed ball uh bill
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
is misleading
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
instead what we're talking about is the
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
detection of a group of cells that are
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
initiating some electrical activity
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
in no way is this detecting a functional
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular system
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
or a functional heartbeat
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
at six weeks of gestation when this
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
electrical activity can be detected by
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
ultrasound no heart valves are in
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
existence in the embryo
 
01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
this flickering can be detected by an
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
ultrasound machine at this early stage
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
of development in pregnancy
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
but this electrical activity
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
is only that
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
the term fetal heartbeat is not a
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
medical term of art or is
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
and it is not used practically in the
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
instead this term is a political tool to
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
further suppress a pregnant person's
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to seek abortion care
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
second criminalization in this bill of
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
health care providers who perform an
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
abortion after approximately six weeks
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
of gestation is an extreme interference
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
by the state as an insulting to the
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
professionals who make great sacrifices
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
to serve their communities
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
it will further disincentivize the best
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
and brightest physicians from practicing
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
obstetrics and gynecology in new
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it will create a health
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
care crisis in the state for those who
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
seek other ob gyn health care needs and
 
01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.149 align:start position:0%
seek other ob gyn health care needs and
services

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
it puts the health care of women girls
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
and pregnant people of this state at
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
severe risk
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
third it's politically inexpedient new
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire will join the infamous ranks
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
of texas and alabama estates that do not
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
recognize women and pregnant people as
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
fully autonomous humans this bill
 
01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:32.070 align:start position:0%
fully autonomous humans this bill
will

01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
attract an unwanted media attention to
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
our state and let all americans know
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
that the live free or die motto is not
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the women girls or pregnant people
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire thank you
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
 
01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.030 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you for your testimony
today

01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
my baby
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think i knew i was pregnant pretty
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
much right away
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
and then of course
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
the signs that you're pregnant were
 
01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.950 align:start position:0%
the signs that you're pregnant were
there

01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.629 align:start position:0%
there
and

01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
it was tested and and then
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
proven that i was
 
01:40:43.510 --> 01:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
by the time i found out and had made the
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
decision to murder my baby and take the
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
life of my baby and kill that
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
person the baby was probably
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
maybe eight weeks and that was a beating
 
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
maybe eight weeks and that was a beating
heart

01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
i want you all to know how difficult
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
because i still suffered like right now
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
from that horrendous decision decision
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
and and i do want to make clear
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the only people who get pregnant are
 
01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.310 align:start position:0%
the only people who get pregnant are
women

01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
the greatest sacrifice people are
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
talking about sacrificing their lives i
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
was i was selfish
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
so i didn't want to sacrifice my way of
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
living the way i had my life going i
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
didn't want to sacrifice that so i
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
sacrificed i blood sacrificed my baby
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
i killed
 
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:37.990 align:start position:0%
i killed
that

01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.109 align:start position:0%
that
other

01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:41:39.119 --> 01:41:40.709 align:start position:0%
other
person

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
i had no right to take that baby's life
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i had no right to steal that baby
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
from my husband and i had no right to
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
steal that baby from my family
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
my mother just passed away in december
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
i had to go away
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
and take a little retreat
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
and as i walked
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the beach where i went
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
i thought about how
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
i had stolen
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
that life
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
from my family
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
not only from that baby
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
but from my family and from the father
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
of that baby whether i am in touch with
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
him now or not
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i want you to know that i don't want
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
any of my federally
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%

01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 1477.
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
as we have already heard today house
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill 1477 intends to prohibit abortion
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
after detection of a fetal heart rate
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
which can be as early as six weeks of
 
01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.709 align:start position:0%
which can be as early as six weeks of
gestation

01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
gestation
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is less than a month after a woman
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
misses her menstrual period
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
what we know from cdc data published in
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
2019 is that the large majority of
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
abortions in this country are performed
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
at what is considered an early gestation
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
which is defined as less than 13 weeks
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
of gestation
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
looking closer at these numbers
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
only 40 percent of those are performed
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
at less than six weeks gestation what
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
these numbers tell us is simple
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of persons needing access
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
to abortion services do not and likely
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
cannot present to care before six weeks
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
gestational age cut off
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
passing this bill makes no impact on the
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
reasons a person may need an abortion
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
be it financial restrictions preventing
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
them from caring for an additional child
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
or threats to their own health care by
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
continuing the pregnancy it does not fix
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes severe prognoses of fetuses
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
affected by conditions that may not be
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
diagnosed until later in pregnancy
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
it cannot stop the cases of sexual
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
assault that result in unintended
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancies it does not fix
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
contraceptive failure
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
instead this bill makes time
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
makes time of the essence it gives
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
people six weeks six weeks at best if
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
they even know they were pregnant six
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
weeks to make sometimes a very very
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
difficult choice and if this choice
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
cannot be made before six weeks it
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
completely takes that choice away
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
this bill will not stop people from
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
needing essential sometimes life-saving
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
abortion services
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
people deserve access to the health care
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
that they need and they deserve it in
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire please oppose
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
bill 1477.
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for the doctor
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
good morning
and

01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
speak my name is karen testerman and i
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
am a citizen of the state of new
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i am domiciled in the city
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
when you took office
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
you swore an oath to support the state
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's constitution
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
words have meaning and this is why
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
elected officials are required to take
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
that oath when they assume their office
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's therefore my belief that your words
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
are truthful and valuable
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
and to be trusted until you prove
 
01:46:50.719 --> 01:46:52.310 align:start position:0%
and to be trusted until you prove
otherwise

01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
part 1 article 2
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
states that all men have certain natural
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights among
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
which are defending life
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
which is why i stand before you today to
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
support the heartbeat as the audible
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
sign of life
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
the heart is the organ that medical
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
practitioners use as a sign of the
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
existence of life
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
therefore it is logical that the
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
presence of a heartbeat is a sign of
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
life you have sworn to defend
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
please consider the following
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
is shorter than representative weckler
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
does that mean that
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative green's life is any more
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
valuable than that of representative
 
01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.390 align:start position:0%
valuable than that of representative
webler

01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
webler
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
the preborn is smaller in size than
 
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.629 align:start position:0%
the preborn is smaller in size than
either

01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:47:46.639 --> 01:47:47.350 align:start position:0%
either
of

01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
the representatives
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
if it would be a crime to murder
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative greene
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
because he is shorter than
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative wesler
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
it stands to reason that we should not
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
allow the murder of the preborn because
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
he she is smaller the preborn is less
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
developed than the born human being
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
does this disqualify the life from being
 
01:48:10.159 --> 01:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
does this disqualify the life from being
defended

01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
defended
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh cannot bear children
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
because her reproductive system is less
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
developed than a 20 year old woman
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
the life of the four-year-old is still
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
as valuable as a child bearing young
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
woman the preborn is less developed than
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
a four-year-old therefore we cannot
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
disqualify the lives of the
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
four-year-old or the pre-born from
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
defending because they are less
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
developed than the older more developed
 
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.430 align:start position:0%
developed than the older more developed
humans

01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
humans
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
the pre-born is located in a different
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
environment than a born human does your
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
location affect your value
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you are a scuba diver in the depths
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
of the water
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
um is your life any more valuable than
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
that of the pilots flying the airplane
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
or the motorcyclists on the roads of new
 
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.270 align:start position:0%
or the motorcyclists on the roads of new
hampshire

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
if any of these humans were in a
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
life-threatening situation we would go
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
to great lengths to save any one of them
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
if changing your environment can't
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
change your value how can a seven inch
 
01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
journey through the birth canal
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
magically train 15 seconds
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
human into any one value
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh because of the location
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative this is just a second
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
this is life
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's just as is to be defended as well
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
the preborn is dependent upon her his
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
mother's body for nutrition and a proper
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
environment for development if you are
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
the only adult present when a toddler
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
falls into a swimming pool are you
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
justified in declaring her of no value
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
because she is dependent upon you for
 
01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
because she is dependent upon you for
survival

01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
survival
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
each i will be done in just
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
minute is dependent upon someone else
 
01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.310 align:start position:0%
minute is dependent upon someone else
each one

01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
for a life-sustaining measure
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
at some point in our lives depending
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
upon another does not disqualify the
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
value of your life
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
neither does the dependency of the
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
preborn disqualify him from being
 
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.790 align:start position:0%
preborn disqualify him from being
defended

01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
defended
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
for survival every life has value no
 
01:50:18.870 --> 01:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
matter their size location environment
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
or dependency
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
the heartbeat i'm got one sentence left
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
the heartbeat
 
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%

01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable members of the
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%

montgomery i'm the vice president of
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
public affairs for planned parenthood
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire action fund and planned
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
parenthood of northern new england just
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
make sure you speak into the microphones
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
sure and understand what you're saying
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
is that better
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
we strongly oppose this bill it is a
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
near total ban on abortion in the state
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire just two quick points
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
for you today
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
firstly supporters of this bill may
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
argue that a pregnant person would still
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
have six weeks to decide if they wanted
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
this is simply not true and reveals a
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
real lack of understanding of the
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
reproductive system
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
as people who have been pregnant know in
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
order for doctors to have a consistent
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
way to estimate the length of pregnancy
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
we use the first day of the last
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
menstruation period
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
as day one of pregnancy
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
even though there is no pregnancy for
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
the first two weeks or so so for those
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
with a regular menstruation cycle this
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill would stop access to safe legal
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
abortion after only a few days after a
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
missed period
 
01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
missed period
secondly

01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
we do not have to imagine a world where
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
abortion is bans to see the real life
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
consequences of this legislation
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
texas has had a near total ban on
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
abortion in effect since september 1st
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
in texas the combination of people not
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
knowing they are pregnant at six weeks
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
and other factors like navigating
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restrictions like a 24-hour
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
mandatory delay and raising the funds
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
for an abortion has made it impossible
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
to get abortion care in texas for far
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
too many people
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
those who do have the means to travel
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
are being met with overloaded health
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
centers at the border states
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
this creates a domino effect leading to
 
01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:48.390 align:start position:0%
this creates a domino effect leading to
border

01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
border
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
state residents being forced to endure
 
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
long delays in care and in some
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
instances because of the decreased
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
availability of appointments than also
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
being forced out of care
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately this is creating chaos for
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
individual patients and for the region
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 1477 would push granite
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
staters out of state to get care if they
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
can afford it
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
sending patients out of state is
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary abortion
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
providers have been operating safely in
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
the state for decades
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will not provide any benefit
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
to patients it will only cause harm
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
so abortion bans like this one are
 
01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.910 align:start position:0%
so abortion bans like this one are
unconstitutional

01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact low-income and
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
marginalized people are deeply unpopular
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
and are an extreme attack on abortion
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
rights and we urge you to oppose this
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill thank you

such scope as dartmouth college and the
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire to urge you
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
just for hp 1477 which would protect the
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
lives of more than a million of your
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
constituents both born and pre-born
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
in a life or death setting the sign of
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
life that true medical professionals
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
look for is a heartbeat whether on the
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
battlefield or in the emergency room
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
that standard applies and yet with such
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
undeniable assurance that they are in
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
fact alive preborn children in the womb
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
face death
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
our current model fails in that it
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
allows the same people who would profit
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
off of the death of an infant in the
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
womb to quote unquote counsel
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
a pregnant woman on whether she should
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
buy an abortion from them
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
in such a delicate moment this allows
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
for a predatory abortion industry to
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
disregard her needs in favor of its own
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
financial gains
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is a conflict of interest serving a
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollar corporate entity and
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
abandons women in a moment of need
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
a majority of women who have had
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
abortions in the united states have said
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
that they felt coerced into getting an
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
abortion including by the abortion
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
industry which makes it imperative that
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
she would not be subjected to counseling
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
quote unquote
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
over a life or death matter in a
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
high-stakes sales environment
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
the majority of millennials in gen z the
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
target demographic of the abortion
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
industry who now make up roughly
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
one-third of the electorate reject
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
abortion violence
 
01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
recent polling finds that three out of
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
four millennials in gen z support limits
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
on abortion while over half
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
support no abortion at all when a
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
heartbeat can be detected or only in
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
rare circumstances such as rape incest
 
01:56:27.510 --> 01:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
or to save the life of the mother
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
in just over two short months since the
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced students for life
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%

that they are pregnant
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%

seven weeks
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
this law would prevent her access to

this law would prevent her access to
abortion

02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
campaign contributors to the democrat
 
02:02:26.239 --> 02:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
campaign contributors to the democrat
party

02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
and they are losing millions of dollars
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
in revenues
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
due to the passage of the fetal life
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
therefore from their perspective
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
the law must be
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
at a minimum gutted or ideally repealed
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire house and senate
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
during this legislative session
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
to make matters worse even from a
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
financial standpoint
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
these abortion providers also 15 seconds
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay mr dennehy could hear you wrap up
 
02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.189 align:start position:0%
okay mr dennehy could hear you wrap up
okay

02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
so therefore i strongly urge you to vote
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
for bill number 1477 thank you thank you
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
mr denny any questions from mr dennehy
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
good morning again chair gordon and
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you so
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
much for hearing my testimony
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
my name again is laura godfrey and i'm
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
17 years old from portsmouth new
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i come before you today in
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 1477 prohibiting
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
abortion after detection of a fetal
 
02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:39.109 align:start position:0%
abortion after detection of a fetal
heartbeat

02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
now this bill is modeled after texas's
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
sb 8 which is a similar ban that
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
restricts abortion after six weeks
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
but i want to point out that within 24
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
hours of the texas texas abortion bill
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
taking effect news outlets reported the
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
first death a new analysis from dr david
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
eisenberg who is a board certified
 
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
obstetrician gynecologist estimates that
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
with the new law in effect in texas the
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
state could see increases in maternal
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
mortality of up to 15 percent overall
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
and is based on previous research that
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
has established a clear link between
 
02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
abortion restrictions and maternal
 
02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.709 align:start position:0%
abortion restrictions and maternal
mortality

02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
in a study published last march states
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
that restricted abortion had a maternal
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
death rate that was nearly double those
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
that had passed laws protecting access
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
to abortion
 
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
banning abortion like texas in new
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire is only guaranteed to hurt new
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire women
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
but on the note of mortality a counter
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
argument that might arise is the
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
included exception within the bill text
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
that an abortion is allowed in the case
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
a pregnant person will die or suffer the
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
impairment of a major bodily function
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
but there are three flaws with this
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
firstly this language is vague and not
 
02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
inclusive of a variety of other
 
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
emergencies it ignores fetal
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
abnormalities or cases of rape or incest
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
and the vagueness of the language in
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill will only hurt pregnant people
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
and doctors will struggle to find the
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
balance between the law and their
 
02:05:06.639 --> 02:05:07.990 align:start position:0%
balance between the law and their
patient

02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
secondly doctors may be reluctant to
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
intervene even in situations that
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
clearly qualify as emergencies how long
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
do doctors wait until they confirm that
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
the emergency will kill the mother
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
before performing the abortion
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
many pregnancy issues like eclampsia or
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
plan placenta accreta aren't always
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
killers but there is still a high risk
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
for organ loss or death
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
where is the line drawn
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
and thirdly the extreme nature of this
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill could also cause many abortion
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
clinics to close their doors which would
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
further reduce access to care for state
 
02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
further reduce access to care for state
residents

02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:05:44.709 --> 02:05:44.719 align:start position:0%
this bill would make access to health
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
care all the more urgent and necessary
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
but its immediate after effects throw
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
doctors into doubt and close the doors
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
for abortion facilities
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
hb 1477 ignores the individual
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance through which pregnant
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
people want to get abortions
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill you could force an
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
assault victim to carry her abuser's
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to turn
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
and some do not even have the means to
 
02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
travel out of state to obtain legal
 
02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
travel out of state to obtain legal
abortions

02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
women will and have resorted to using
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
coat hangers downing down pills or
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
hurting themselves to get rid of a
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
pregnancy they cannot support
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
this committee has to understand 15
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
seconds matter the ban abortion is still
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to happen but it is up to you to
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not those abortions
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
will be safe okay could you finish i
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
urge you to itl this bill thank you
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today are
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
seeing that again thank you
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
hi there my name is louise spencer from
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i i think in a
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
debate as important as one surrounding
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and control of
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
one's body
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's really important to have
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
the facts at hand and
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
study after study has shown that
 
02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.350 align:start position:0%
study after study has shown that
women

02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
over both short term periods such as
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
five years
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
or long term periods
 
02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:19.990 align:start position:0%
or long term periods
generally

02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
not in every instance for sure and we've
 
02:07:22.079 --> 02:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
not in every instance for sure and we've
heard

02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
testimony about
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
women who do regret their abortions
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
but that the majority of women
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
describe the primary emotion as relief
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
that they were able to access
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
abortion care and that they were able to
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
have that kind of control over their
 
02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.149 align:start position:0%
have that kind of control over their
body

02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
and their life
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i just think it's really essential
 
02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:46.470 align:start position:0%
so i just think it's really essential
that

02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
as we're considering these questions
 
02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
that we look at
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
the data
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
as it stands
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's also very good data
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
on generational breakdowns about
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
support for reproductive freedom
 
02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:03.189 align:start position:0%
support for reproductive freedom
and

02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think there's some important
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
statistics there too that we can send
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
along so thank you very much
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr spencer
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
seeing them again thank you
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
dr young
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
i will forego
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
my introduction since i already gave
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
that to you
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
i want to make clear that
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
intravaginal ultrasound is so sensitive
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
today we're picking up fetal hearts
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
five to six weeks following the first
 
02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:47.669 align:start position:0%
five to six weeks following the first
day

02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
of a woman's last menstrual period or
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
three to four weeks gestation a time
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
when most women
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
do not know
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
that they're pregnant
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
so if this bill passes
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
it becomes a statute it will essentially
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just old enough to have experienced
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
the sweeping change we saw
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
when abortion became
 
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.589 align:start position:0%
when abortion became
legal

02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%

02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
i admitted a young woman
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
with vaginal bleeding
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%

02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
she admitted
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
that she had had a botched abortion
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%

02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
we gave her iv fluids we gave her the
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
best antibiotics that were available at
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
then we took her to the operating room
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
and removed a perforated uterus it was
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
filled with pus
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
i can still smell the stench
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
i asked her why she wasn't using birth
 
02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
i asked her why she wasn't using birth
control

02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
she said she couldn't use birth control
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
because she was catholic
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
i asked her why she didn't tell her
 
02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.430 align:start position:0%
i asked her why she didn't tell her
parents

02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
about her pregnancy
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
she said she couldn't tell them
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
her father was responsible for her
 
02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
her father was responsible for her
pregnancy

02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
and she said her mom would have died if
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
she had learned that her daughter was
 
02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:39.510 align:start position:0%
she had learned that her daughter was
pregnant

02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she did die
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
this was an honor student
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
this was a star of her high school
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
nine

02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
nine
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
of what was a classic
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
septic abortion so common
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
i've testified before this committee
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
many times
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
i was always concerned that i might
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
break down
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
telling it
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
i can still see this young woman 15
 
02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.069 align:start position:0%
i can still see this young woman 15
seconds

02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
go back
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
others should not be making decisions
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
for women especially when it comes to
 
02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.069 align:start position:0%
for women especially when it comes to
pregnancy

02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
02:11:40.079 --> 02:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
please

02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill

thank you
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%

02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm sarah smith from

pembroke new hampshire
um

02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
i just i think there have been some
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful testimony i oppose this bill
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
one you can see there is no exception
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
for rape in this bill
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
and uh at
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
at six weeks that's not enough time to
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
really get ready for this at
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
this event
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
um i'll give you another real life
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
example from my own life
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
one time i became pregnant and i did not
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
realize i was pregnant until
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
18 weeks
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is real folks this is not just what
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
somebody is saying as testimony that
 
02:13:06.709 --> 02:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
they've heard this is real people people
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
do not realize that they're pregnant
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
right away
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
it is possible to go a long time and not
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
know it
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
so there you have
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
no exception for rape a rape victim
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't realize she's pregnant until
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
many many months many many weeks later
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
this is about
choice

02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
choice
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
women having a choice if they choose to
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
carry a pregnancy then they don't need
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
to have an abortion if they do not
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
choose they have that right to choose
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
they have that private bodily autonomy
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we talk about so much
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
that is their right
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this this bill takes away that right
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the most egregious way
 
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
02:14:04.639 --> 02:14:05.510 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
any

02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for missman
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for hearing me again
 
02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:24.069 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for hearing me again
today

02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat any testimony
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
specifically but i do want to just
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple of things from a
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
medical perspective
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
what several other
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
people have testified
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
i will concur that
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
six weeks of pregnancy is in fact
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
usually the very earliest that a woman
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
will know that she's pregnant um because
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the way that we calculate
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
gestational age based on a woman's last
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
menstrual period
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
because of the amazing technology that
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
we have now with ultrasounds we are
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
able to detect the very earliest
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
electrical impulses of
 
02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
an embryo's cardiac activity at that
 
02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
time sometimes around around that time
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
of six weeks
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not a proxy for
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
viability of an embryo
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
about one in four pregnancies
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
actually ended miscarriage in the first
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
trimester because
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
most of the development of organs are
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
happening and there can be chromosomal
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
abnormalities early early in pregnancy
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
many women don't know that they're
 
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:34.950 align:start position:0%
many women don't know that they're
pregnant

02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
because they don't have regular
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
menstrual periods
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
or maybe they have other reasons that
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
could prevent them from getting to
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
a doctor's office most of the patients
 
02:15:45.430 --> 02:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
that i see
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
present for their first prenatal
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
appointment or their first

indication of pregnancy later than six
 
02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:56.229 align:start position:0%

02:15:56.239 --> 02:15:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
here

02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the united states we don't have the
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
best sexual health education and i also
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
would just like to highlight that
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
adolescents may not have the resources
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
to have access to contraception
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
to know that they're pregnant
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
or to be able to prevent pregnancy and
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
even those who
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
are trying to prevent pregnancy they
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
still have barriers a lot of
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
patients are scaled scared to tell their
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
parents or their partners that they are
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
pregnant and there are many barriers to
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
abortion care
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
because of the gestational age this bill
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
effectively would
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate abortion for all granite
 
02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:36.790 align:start position:0%
eliminate abortion for all granite
staters

02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
staters
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
abortion is a safe common and essential
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
component of health care i'm too young
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
to have experienced the experiences that
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
dr young is mentioning and i don't want
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
to ever see them
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
we have shown
 
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
through data that abortion is
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
safe it is an essential component of
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
health care and it is something that
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
i need to be able to counsel my patients
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
on as an option
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
it is not the answer for everyone but it
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
should be a medically safe
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
option for women in our state i oppose
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you for hearing my
 
02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:12.389 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you for hearing my
testimony

02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for the doctor
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for your
 
02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for your
testimony

02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
hello again my name is josie pinto a
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
constituent of dover testifying in
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to hp 1477.
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned previously i run an
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
organization that aids people in
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
accessing abortion services i have
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
direct experience working at a
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
reproductive health center and every day
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
i help patients figure out how they can
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
access abortion
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
an abortion ban at the point of fetal
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
heartbeat would be absolutely
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the health and well-being
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
of granite staters and would force the
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
majority of people seeking abortions to
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
have to go out of state for that care
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
i have watched as fellow abortion funds
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
in texas help coordinate care for
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
patients experiencing a six-week ban and
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
it has led to absolute logistical
 
02:18:10.559 --> 02:18:11.910 align:start position:0%
it has led to absolute logistical
nightmares

02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
nightmares
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
the surrounding states near texas can't
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
keep up with the demand often booking
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
weeks out
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
many people find themselves having to
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
get plane tickets to get care
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
we know we've even had patients come up
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire from texas
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
and we're among the furthest possible
 
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.309 align:start position:0%
and we're among the furthest possible
states

02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's just the consequences of one
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
state enacting a six-week ban
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
what's to come if more states enact
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
similar bans as well
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
the fact is people are not going to stop
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
getting abortions but laws like this put
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
a massive strain on patients and
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
organizations like the one i run
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
they add a massive cost burden to an
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
already expensive situation
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
cause patients to have to take
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
significant times off of work get hotels
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
there would be absolutely no way to meet
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
the full needs of patients if this law
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
were to pass which is exactly the point
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation like this
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
at six weeks many people do not know
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
they are pregnant yet
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
let alone able to get an abortion
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
appointment by that time
 
02:19:17.110 --> 02:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
as others have said it bears mentioning
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy is calculated from the
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
last date of your menstrual period
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
meaning that a six weeks pregnant is
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
very close to someone's missed period
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
and could be
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
understood as a two-week ban
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to expect people to get
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
an appointment made that quickly and as
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
such this bill would essentially ban
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
nearly all abortions
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
as it stands this law would be blatantly
 
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
as it stands this law would be blatantly
unconstitutional

02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
at a time when our rights hang in the
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
balance at the federal level we need to
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
be doing everything we can to ensure
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
abortion remains accessible not harder
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
to access
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
the detrimental impact on public health
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
economic well-being and patient safety
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
cannot be understated here
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
i urge you all to vote inexpedient to
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislate on this bill thank you
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for

of the committee for the record my name
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
is nikki kelsey i represent bedford
 
04:04:19.590 --> 04:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
hillsborough district 7.
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
i come to you today to bring you house
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill 1625 which i like to call the
 
04:04:26.790 --> 04:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
sidewalk free speech act
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech is protected not only
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
by the u.s constitution but by the new
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire bill of rights
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
our state constitution is even more
 
04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
adamant than our federal first amendment
 
04:04:40.389 --> 04:04:40.399 align:start position:0%
part one article 22
 
04:04:42.389 --> 04:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
says that free speech should be
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
inviolably preserved yet free speech
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
faces growing threats at both the
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
federal and state levels from those who
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
would suppress their opponent's speech
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
because they fear losing an open contest
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
of ideas
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
these threats should be reminders of why
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
the freedom of speech is protected in
 
04:05:02.950 --> 04:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
supreme court justice william o douglas
 
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
once said that freedom of speech may
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
indeed best serve its high purpose when
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
it induces a condition of unrest or even
 
04:05:16.710 --> 04:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
stirs people to anger speech is often
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
provocative and challenging that is why
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech is protected against
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
censorship or punishment
 
04:05:26.469 --> 04:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
abortion is one issue where there is
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
unrest on both sides of the debate
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
both new hampshire's buffer zone law
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
represents an attempt to stifle the
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
contentious debate surrounding abortion
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing freedom of speech
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
to serve its purpose
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
the buffer zone law allows abortion
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
clinics to demarcate a 25-foot zone
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
around clinics in which nobody may
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
counsel against or protest abortion
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
supporters of the buffer zone law might
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
claim that it functions to protect women
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
who are seeking an abortion from being
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted or harassed
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
but the truth is assault
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening and harassment are
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
all already illegal in new hampshire
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
the actual effect of the law is to
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
privilege pro-abortion speech and
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
marginalized speech critical of abortion
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that i am introducing would
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
repeal the buffer zone law yet it should
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
merit the votes of not only the pro-life
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
or even those who simply champion free
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
speech but all of those who value full
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
responsible government
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's because in 2014 massachusetts
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
buffer zone law was declared
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the u.s supreme
 
04:06:37.840 --> 04:06:38.790 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the u.s supreme
court

04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
our buffer zone law is identical in all
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
relevant aspects to this
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional massachusetts law if
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
our buffer zone law is legally
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
challenged it will be repealed
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire will have wasted
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money defending a law that is
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
not only unjust but unconstitutional and
 
04:06:55.840 --> 04:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
not only unjust but unconstitutional and
futile

04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
futile
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
for all these reasons the buffer zone
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
law should be repealed thank you so much
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%

04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
did you say that the knights of columbus
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
provides ultrasound and prenatal care
 
04:11:48.389 --> 04:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
and counseling for women
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
right the
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of the 12
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
free pro-life abortion clinics in the
 
04:11:56.710 --> 04:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
do provide free ultrasound as a matter
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
of fact
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
our council 1820 in claremont raised
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
funds and helped install two ultrasounds
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
one in claremont and one in west lebanon
 
04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
for the day spring pregnancy center
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about tens of
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we know that uh
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
85 to 95 percent of the women who see
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
that ultrasound sonogram image often
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
adopt or or opt to keep the child
 
04:12:34.630 --> 04:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%

04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have cards from them do they
 
04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
want to testify at all
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%

04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%

04:13:15.030 --> 04:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
hacken phillips of grafton county
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
district 12 representing hanover lime i
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition to hb 1625 for four
 
04:13:20.399 --> 04:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition to hb 1625 for four
reasons

04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
first the bill suffers from a faulty
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
premise that the first amendment of
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech is absolute
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
the supreme court of the united states
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
has repeatedly held that the free
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech is limited and
 
04:13:33.269 --> 04:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
qualifiable for example
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
imminent threats hate speech and
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
fighting words are not protected
 
04:13:39.590 --> 04:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
a basic tenet of american political
 
04:13:41.110 --> 04:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
thought has established that one
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
citizen's right to exercise a
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected protected
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
activity ends at another citizen's right
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
to be free from an unlawful prohibition
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
of a constitutionally protected activity
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
thus once limited free speech ends at
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
another's fundamental right to access
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
health care
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
second the bill suffers from a misguided
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
application of precedent in 2014 a
 
04:14:04.229 --> 04:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
plurality of scotus held in the mccullen
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
versus coakley case that a massachusetts
 
04:14:09.750 --> 04:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
law mandating a 35-foot buffer zone
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
around a clinic that provided abortions
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
was presumptively unconstitutional
 
04:14:14.080 --> 04:14:15.269 align:start position:0%
was presumptively unconstitutional
unless

04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
unless
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
a state more narrowly tailored its law
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
to target clinic obstructions
 
04:14:22.309 --> 04:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
and a basic public right-of-way within
 
04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
the demarcation of the buffer zone
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
the supreme court held that the public
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
discourse on a public right-of-way is
 
04:14:27.920 --> 04:14:29.030 align:start position:0%
discourse on a public right-of-way is
protected

04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
protected
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
and that laws making it illegal to
 
04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to intimidate injure or
 
04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
interfere with anyone coming or going
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
from an abortion clinic within the zone
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
are constitutional
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
but the authors of the bill do not
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand this nuance
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
instead they select a part of the legal
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
precedent that is politically expedient
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see the specific failure of
 
04:14:49.110 --> 04:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
analysis present in section roman
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
numeral four of the bill which is
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
duplicative of existing legal rights
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
section roman numeral five and six of
 
04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
the bill also inappropriately assert
 
04:14:58.950 --> 04:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
that all of the rsas
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
codifying the access to reproductive
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
health care facilities is likely to be
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
struck down by the coakley precedent
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is plain wrong
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has said that the
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts closed a
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of a traditional
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
public forum
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
to all speakers a content neutral act
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
but the court would allow a more
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored law
 
04:15:19.990 --> 04:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
that serves a significant government
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
interest rrsas do serve a critical
 
04:15:25.110 --> 04:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
public service
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
and purpose the right to access
 
04:15:26.560 --> 04:15:28.229 align:start position:0%
and purpose the right to access
healthcare

04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
third the mechanics of the severability
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
clause and skoda's precedent maintain
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
that if any part of the existing law
 
04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
fails to be valid under a court order
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
then the rest of the law remains valid
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the extent it makes sense the effect
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the 2014 scope is precedent therefore
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
means that our our states would remain
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
largely intact
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
fourth and finally total repeal of this
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
rsa section would be a mistake repeal
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
would create an undue burden on a
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
pregnant person's right to access
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
reproductive health care facilities and
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
it would remove the significant
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
remaining portions of the law that the
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
supreme court has upheld worse it would
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
create an atmosphere of free range
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
imminent threats intimidation of those
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
seeking abortion and no enforcement
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
against those who are violent or
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
exercising unprotected speech within
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
that zone
 
04:16:13.510 --> 04:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
practically speaking it makes our health
 
04:16:15.110 --> 04:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
care providers and law enforcement
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
officers jobs much more difficult
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
please support their efforts thus i urge
 
04:16:20.000 --> 04:16:20.790 align:start position:0%
please support their efforts thus i urge
you

04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:16:22.030 --> 04:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
to itl
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
hp1625 thank you
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
exactly three minutes
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent mclean
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:16:37.110 --> 04:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i i was trying to
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
catch everything you're saying but you
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
were going really quick i think to get
 
04:16:42.870 --> 04:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
in inside that three-minute margin but
 
04:16:44.630 --> 04:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
could you tell me
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
what the differences are between the
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law and our law
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
that you think
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
would insulate
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
our law
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
versus you know their law based on the
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
mccullen versus coakley decision thank
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
you representative that is an excellent
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
question one which is very difficult to
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
articulate within the three-minute time
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
period um and which extended legal
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
analysis would um
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's difficult to provide you
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
with that here but essentially i can
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
tell you that the massachusetts law was
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
content neutral it outlawed all public
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
discourse in a public walkway
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
our rsa is more specifically toned
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
to providing a buffer zone and then
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
prohibiting certain people from entering
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
it um but you'll notice in those
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
exceptions that any person using the
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
public right-of-way is welcome to go
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
through that space especially if they're
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
just you know passing through
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
the point of the scotus legal analysis
 
04:17:45.750 --> 04:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
that would be applicable to the
 
04:17:48.630 --> 04:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions would just be simply to
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
affect effectively
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's rsa 132 colin
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
38 subsection d
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
from roman numeral 1 6 sub section d
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's a specific part of the law that
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
talks about that public walkway and
 
04:18:06.309 --> 04:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not people can move through
 
04:18:09.030 --> 04:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
that space of course we know that scotus
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
has said anyone can use public discourse
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
in the public walkway
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
and our our law is nearly
 
04:18:17.830 --> 04:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to specifically allow
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
people to use that space you would just
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
simply have to remove the second half of
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
the clause of this
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh sentence in order to make it
 
04:18:26.159 --> 04:18:28.630 align:start position:0%
uh sentence in order to make it
more

04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.550 --> 04:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know in align with the scotus
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
precedent which means that the rest of
 
04:18:35.590 --> 04:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
the rsa stands on its own
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
that small removal of a spot is severed
 
04:18:40.950 --> 04:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
the small removal of that sentence is
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
severed from the entire rsa so the
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
remaining still makes sense remaining
 
04:18:49.189 --> 04:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
laws still hold legal precedent and
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
protections for both protesters and
 
04:18:53.429 --> 04:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
people seeking health care
 
04:18:53.439 --> 04:18:54.309 align:start position:0%
people seeking health care
um

04:18:54.309 --> 04:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
at those facilities as well as those
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
providers and employees and law
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
so to strike the entire law does not
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
make sense okay
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%

women who are considering an abortion
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
deserve the opportunity to receive
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
information that may help them to
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
continue with their pregnancies
 
04:19:59.600 --> 04:20:00.870 align:start position:0%

i'll share a snapshot of experiences
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
that help in understanding the distress
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
of a crisis pregnancy
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the import of an exchange of
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
information surrounding choices
 
04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
i'm a post-abortive woman
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
i experienced a saline abortion in new
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
york city in july of 1970.
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
i was 15 years old accompanied by my
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
mother who is 37.
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
although strongly opposed to abortion
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
the adults in my life succumb to outside
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
pressure framed from around my youth
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
continued education and loss of future
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities coercion and fear put me
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
on the abortion train
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
my family did not have ready access to
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
information about alternatives to
 
04:20:50.239 --> 04:20:51.990 align:start position:0%
information about alternatives to
abortion

04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
would i have had the courage to choose
 
04:20:57.429 --> 04:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
life if i had encountered someone
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
silently praying on the sidewalk or
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
better yet
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
offering ready resources to support me
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
in crisis
 
04:21:05.199 --> 04:21:06.389 align:start position:0%
in crisis
now

04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
52 years later my brain continues to
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
black out significant chunks of memory
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
from that week in new york city
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's a human survival response to trauma
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
i now understand that only a shadow of a
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
once vibrant girl emerged from that
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
typical patterns of behavior for many
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
post-abortive women include
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
substance abuse broken or abusive
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
relationships and poor decision-making
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
results of injury to the prefrontal
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
cortex through experienced trauma
 
04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
some of my post-abortive experiences
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
were consistent with this pattern over
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
many decades in 1970
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
no one met me on the sidewalk to offer
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
an alternative to abortion
 
04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
without the support of informational
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
intervention my mother was not equipped
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
to help me to carry a crisis pregnancy
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
to term
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
many women are abort out of desperation
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
and ignorance of community support
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
systems in place
 
04:22:17.429 --> 04:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
and ready to help
 
04:22:17.439 --> 04:22:18.550 align:start position:0%
and ready to help
please

04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
protect our first amendment right to
 
04:22:22.710 --> 04:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
speech in this case
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
effective discourse that supports women
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
in crisis with potential for saving a
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
life thank you

a position as a still
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
i'm someone
 
04:23:09.279 --> 04:23:10.630 align:start position:0%
i'm someone
who

04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:23:12.830 --> 04:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
was a victim of
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
incest from the age of five years old
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to hear people saying freedom
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
of speech
 
04:23:26.550 --> 04:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
when i didn't have that when i was a
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
little girl 5 years old
 
04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
i went through that trauma until i was
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
15 years old
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
i moved here
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
and i was a victim of domestic violence
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sick and tired of people telling me
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
what what is right and what is wrong for
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
victims like myself
 
04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
i had enough
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
staying quiet because
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
for my family it was better to stay
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
quiet because
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be appointed by the
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
society because
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
my own father did that to me
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
my father was a well-known person
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
where i came from
 
04:24:08.469 --> 04:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
and my mom was so afraid that people
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
gonna judge us because people are gonna
 
04:24:14.070 --> 04:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
start talking about my family because
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
i was gonna tell people that i was
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
abused by my own dad
 
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
on second time people told me that is
 
04:24:22.000 --> 04:24:23.429 align:start position:0%
on second time people told me that is
okay

04:24:23.429 --> 04:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sick and tired of people say that we
 
04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
have to carry babies
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
even though
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
that can be that that means caring baby
 
04:24:33.030 --> 04:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
from my own father
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
i was abused again
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
when i was nine years old for another
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%

04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is kathleen
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
yanian and i have been a sidewalk
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
advocate for over three years at the
 
04:26:29.110 --> 04:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood facility in
 
04:26:29.120 --> 04:26:30.389 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood facility in
manchester

04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
i support house bill 1625
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
as a wife mother grandmother and
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
registered nurse for over 34 years
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
my hope as a sidewalk advocate is to
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
help women by providing good and
 
04:26:46.149 --> 04:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
alternative information
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
which includes a list of community
 
04:26:47.840 --> 04:26:49.429 align:start position:0%
which includes a list of community
resources

04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
and alternative information
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
excuse me both public and private such
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
as pregnancy help centers
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
information on fetal development
 
04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
post-abortive health groups and most
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
importantly a listening ear
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
to those conflicted
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
at no time have i witnessed any
 
04:27:07.760 --> 04:27:09.670 align:start position:0%
at no time have i witnessed any
counseling

04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
prayer is said by those gathered for
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
both the women walking in
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
and staff working at the facility
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
at no time have i witnessed violence at
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood in manchester
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
the manchester police details were ended
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
almost two years ago and replaced with a
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
security person
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
which to my understanding is only on
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
wednesday's surgical abortion day
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
their role as i have witnessed is to
 
04:27:38.630 --> 04:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
walk clients into the building within
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
the fenced parking lot
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
and open the door
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
some sit in their cars while others
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
remain inside the facility
 
04:27:49.110 --> 04:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
a remarkable testimony to the passing of
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1625
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time an opportunity
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
to speak with you
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
and may god bless the great state of new
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire and may god bless america

thank you ms yanian any questions
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
see none thanks again
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
again my name is kayla montgomery and i
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
represent planned parenthood and we
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 1625
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
so first just as some quick background
 
04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill this body passed to senate
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill 319 and was signed into law back in
 
04:28:29.279 --> 04:28:31.030 align:start position:0%
bill 319 and was signed into law back in
2014.

04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
2014.
 
04:28:33.510 --> 04:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation was to address public
 
04:28:34.950 --> 04:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
safety concerns
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
by allowing a non-mandatory patient
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
safety zone of up to 25 feet surrounding
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
entrances to reproductive health
 
04:28:42.720 --> 04:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
entrances to reproductive health
facilities

04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:28:45.670 --> 04:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
this flexible
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
this flexibility allows for communities
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
to tailor a zone in accordance to local
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
factors and local public safety needs
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i want to just explain a little bit
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
about why patients and providers need
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to use the patient
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
safety zones
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
so reproductive health centers in new
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire have always felt the impact of
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
protest activities however following
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
national trends over the past few years
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
the volume and the frequency of these
 
04:29:14.070 --> 04:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
protests have increased particularly
 
04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic began
 
04:29:18.309 --> 04:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
some of the types of the harassing
 
04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
tactics that our local health center
 
04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
are the obstruction of the driveway
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
entrance so protesters will gather in
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
front of the driveway and they'll often
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
block it with a physical object at the
 
04:29:31.990 --> 04:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
entrance which creates a barrier for
 
04:29:33.510 --> 04:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
patients who are trying to enter the
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
health center forcing patients to
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily wait as the driveway gets
 
04:29:37.680 --> 04:29:38.950 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily wait as the driveway gets
cleared

04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
cleared
 
04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
protesters also invade the privacy of
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
those who do not wish to engage in
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
dialogue with them while entering or
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
exiting the building
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
there is blocking of on-street parking
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
spaces verbal assaults
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
photographing of patients and providers
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is all a violation of patient
 
04:29:59.349 --> 04:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
privacy but it is also a major public
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
safety issue
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
the unnecessarily congested driveway has
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
caused patients to become confused and
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
distracted and has actually led to some
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
minor car accidents so to try to
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
mitigate the harm of this public safety
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
situation planned parenthood has had to
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
install a new fence to help patients
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
navigate this issue
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
and while the fence is better for
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
patient safety it has completely changed
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
the privacy around the parking lot and
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
it now allows protesters to have full
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
visibility into the parking lot
 
04:30:35.910 --> 04:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood is forced to change
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's forced to trade patient privacy
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
for public safety when in fact everyone
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
deserves to have both and currently yes
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood uses on
 
04:30:47.110 --> 04:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
on-site security controlling twenty-five
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year and calls the
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
police are certainly much more frequent
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
so establishing a patient safety zone is
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
just one tool in the toolkit for health
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
centers and local authorities to use
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
while working together to protect public
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
safety and privacy of patients and
 
04:31:04.239 --> 04:31:05.349 align:start position:0%
safety and privacy of patients and
providers

04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
while also balancing first amendment
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
rights so it's not necessarily the first
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
or the only tool that health centers and
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
communities have the flexibility to use
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
the zone if needed
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
04:31:20.229 --> 04:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you in conclusion no one should
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
face violence harassment or threats when
 
04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
accessing safe legal care everyone the
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
governor to legislators to patients
 
04:31:28.389 --> 04:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
deserve to feel safe
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh when they're accessing the care they
 
04:31:30.000 --> 04:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
uh when they're accessing the care they
need

04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood certainly recognizes
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
first amendment uh peaceful free speech
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
but this law does not violate it just
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
bad other questions from ms montgomery
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
ms chase
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you mr
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you mr montgomery for
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you just um
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
enlighten me about what the future would
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
hold if this bill were to go into effect
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you for the question um
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood is certainly
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot about what a post-role
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
world looks like i'm sure everyone in
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
this committee understands
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
that a row could be overturned as soon
 
04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
as june
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
which would mean that many states
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
probably up to 26 states would move to
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
ban or deeply restrict access
 
04:32:13.600 --> 04:32:14.790 align:start position:0%
ban or deeply restrict access
immediately

04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
when that happens
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
there will be many more patients coming
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire coming to northern new
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
england coming to states where abortion
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
is still legal we also know that with
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
that will come more protesters because
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
when abortion is illegal in their state
 
04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
they will go to places where abortion is
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
legal so we do expect many more
 
04:32:35.040 --> 04:32:36.950 align:start position:0%
legal so we do expect many more
protesters

04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
protesters
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
after row falls when row falls if roe
 
04:32:40.399 --> 04:32:41.510 align:start position:0%
after row falls when row falls if roe
falls

04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
falls
 
04:32:42.790 --> 04:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
and we know that these tactics are
 
04:32:42.800 --> 04:32:43.670 align:start position:0%
and we know that these tactics are
getting

04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
getting
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
much bolder i'm sure everyone also
 
04:32:49.349 --> 04:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
recently saw that planned parenthood was
 
04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
destroyed in an arson fire just a few
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative otter thank you mr
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
04:33:02.070 --> 04:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
question you had mentioned the driveway
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
being blocked is there a police report
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you could provide to us
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have something i can provide you
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
right now but yes there's lots of police
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
reports that are filed we work
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
with the manchester police specifically
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
the community policing division
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
we do calls with them we talk with them
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
so there's quite a few
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
over the years there's quite a few filed
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um
 
04:33:31.349 --> 04:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
you you gave some testimony as to some
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the obstacles you faced you talked
 
04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
about you know creating a barrier for
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
the patients photographing and insulting
 
04:33:38.799 --> 04:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
the patients photographing and insulting
people

04:33:39.750 --> 04:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
so this law in new hampshire has been in
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
effect for seven years
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
why have you chosen not to exercise this
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
law and take advantage of its provisions
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
in the last seven years if your
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
your patients are so threatened sure
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question like i
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony we do feel
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's an important tool in the toolkit
 
04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the first not
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily the only we do work on
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
incremental steps in order to create
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
public safety like i mentioned we
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
work with the manchester mayor i believe
 
04:34:14.551 --> 04:34:14.561 align:start position:0%
she submitted testimony today we work
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
the community policing division
 
04:34:16.480 --> 04:34:17.349 align:start position:0%
the community policing division
um

04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
some things have taken a little bit
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
longer than we had hoped certainly these
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
things do take time to do them right we
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
were the manchester health center went
 
04:34:26.949 --> 04:34:26.959 align:start position:0%
over went through renovations changing
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
the footprint particularly the parking
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
lot and those just wrapped up last year
 
04:34:32.551 --> 04:34:32.561 align:start position:0%
so that was a little bit of a delay but
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know also i think it's really
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
important to note that planned
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
parenthood is not the only
 
04:34:40.150 --> 04:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
the only enforcement here that is a
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
shared enforcement with planned
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
parenthood and with the new hampshire
 
04:34:44.390 --> 04:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
ag's office
 
04:34:47.510 --> 04:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so i i think if there feels like
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a little bit more
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
alignment that would be a great question
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
for the ag's office and we'd be happy to
 
04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
have that conversation
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
and if i may um you asked a question of
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
the representative from grafton earlier
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
about the massachusetts law and she did
 
04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of explaining the
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
differences between the massachusetts
 
04:35:04.320 --> 04:35:05.109 align:start position:0%
differences between the massachusetts
law

04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
and i just want to add two points to it
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
if that's okay with you um
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts law which was struck
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
down by this u.s supreme court it was a
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
non-flexible law and it was 35 feet and
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
it was for every reproductive health
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
center regardless of whether they wanted
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
it or not regardless of whether it
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
worked in their community the difference
 
04:35:27.910 --> 04:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
is that this law it is uh not mandatory
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's only if reproductive health centers
 
04:35:32.709 --> 04:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
want it and it is up to 25 feet so one
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
community might want five feet one might
 
04:35:34.639 --> 04:35:35.349 align:start position:0%
community might want five feet one might
want

04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:35:37.510 --> 04:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
feet but it's the flexibility that is
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
one of the key differences between the
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
man the massachusetts law which was
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
struck down in new hampshire
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my my rational next election
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
is but having confirmed it wasn't um
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law
 
04:35:54.959 --> 04:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law
um

04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
rewritten well written and then
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
substantially revised
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
after the mccullen versus coakley case
 
04:36:03.750 --> 04:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
made it to the supreme court
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
with an eye towards avoiding the
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
problems that
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
led to that
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
law eventually being overturned
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
or at least
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of the exact timing on the
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts law but i can tell you on
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire law if i understand
 
04:36:19.349 --> 04:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
your question correctly the new
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire law the actual
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the new hampshire
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
law has never been tested because it has
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
never been enforced and so
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
when this law passed back in 2014
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
protester the protesters asked for
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for this law to be
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
overturned the
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
judge dismissed the case for lack of
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
standing and that was back in
 
04:36:44.080 --> 04:36:46.310 align:start position:0%
standing and that was back in
2016

04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
2016
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that many people on this
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
committee are familiar with that case it
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
was the mary rose ready versus attorney
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
joe foster law and then that was
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed by the
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%

and options
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
i recall a couple of years ago
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
for example we met a young woman and
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
there was a language barrier
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
she did not speak a word of english
 
04:38:48.310 --> 04:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
somehow though she understood
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
and took up the offer of help all free
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
she was literally given a new family
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
who took her in
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
and she now has a little girl who's a
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
year and a half old and both of them are
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
other women have come back
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
to thank us just for being there
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the support or even
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
for the baby showers we might have
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
thrown them
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
and simply they are just grateful
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the presence of others who help them
 
04:39:28.949 --> 04:39:28.959 align:start position:0%
to choose life
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
women deserve good information
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
on their way in we offer the resources
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%

04:44:07.190 --> 04:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
i've worn the rainbow vest before and
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's in my comfort
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
zone but
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
i felt it was something i should do
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
as a catholic raised man in this society
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
i've come up believing that i'm right no
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
matter what when it comes to this issue
 
04:44:21.270 --> 04:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
while i'm not here to debate pro-choice
 
04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
versus pro-life in regards to hb 1625
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
i'm here to tell you i've worked with
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
many victims of sexual violence in the
 
04:44:31.590 --> 04:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
issue most paramount to their recovery
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
is to show them safety community and
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
body autonomy is possible again
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
1625 will be a direct assault on women's
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
right to feel safe in their life choices
 
04:44:42.788 --> 04:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
without walking through
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
a phalanx of those who presume to know
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
better than her
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
lastly i have a strong gift in an
 
04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
independent little girl
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
no legislators need insult her
 
04:44:51.440 --> 04:44:52.708 align:start position:0%
no legislators need insult her
intelligence

04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
intelligence
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
along the way by the presumption that
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
she didn't weigh all sides of an issue
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
trying to enter the healthcare facility
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
women are well aware of what's going on
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
i assure you thank you for your time
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
any questions from mr harlow
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.830 --> 04:45:29.840 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:45:42.958 --> 04:45:45.030 align:start position:0%
um
my

04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%

04:45:51.270 --> 04:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
am the leader of 40 days for life which
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
is a prayer and fasting campaign
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
to pray for the end of abortion
 
04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
this happens in concord during lent
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's a 40 day
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
24 7 prayer vigil on the sidewalk in
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
front of the concord equality health
 
04:46:08.878 --> 04:46:11.590 align:start position:0%
front of the concord equality health
center

04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.600 --> 04:46:12.628 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
i never thought i would be on the
 
04:46:20.560 --> 04:46:21.830 align:start position:0%
i never thought i would be on the
sidewalk

04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalk
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
and it's a very challenging experience
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
so what i do is i go there
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
pray that's all i do
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's just me myself and i i don't
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
generally have a sign if i have a sign
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
it's our lady of guadalupe the mother of
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
jesus kind of on me
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
and so i've observed a lot over six
 
04:46:44.798 --> 04:46:46.070 align:start position:0%
and so i've observed a lot over six
years

04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
and during this time that the buffer
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
zone has been in in place but it's never
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
been enforced
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and in this um so what i observe from
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
the street when you have
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
pro-life people
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
and you have
 
04:47:03.990 --> 04:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
pro-choice people and we all know it's a
 
04:47:04.000 --> 04:47:05.110 align:start position:0%
pro-choice people and we all know it's a
very

04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
conflict dialogue
 
04:47:07.760 --> 04:47:09.270 align:start position:0%
conflict dialogue
um

04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
is that it's reminded me of playground
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm like man this is like this can be
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
really juvenile often it's just really
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
you know just nothing just very people
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
work well together very respectful and
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
then you get these
 
04:47:28.230 --> 04:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
spouts of like conflict and so it just
 
04:47:30.550 --> 04:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
it can bring out the worst in people can
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
bring out the best and all of this is
 
04:47:34.550 --> 04:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
happening without any buffer zone
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
happening at all so um the police have
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
been called a few times there have been
 
04:47:42.150 --> 04:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
various things and then also we've had
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
very respectful dialogues and i have a
 
04:47:45.990 --> 04:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
very good working relationship with
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
dahlia who's the director of the
 
04:47:50.550 --> 04:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
equality health center and
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
so the way i feel about the reason i
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
feel like everybody should vote yes on
 
04:47:57.750 --> 04:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
this bill regardless of your pro-choice
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
or pro-life convictions
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
is because
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
free speech working
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of messy sometimes but
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's working
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
the current law has a buffer zone
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
involved and i'm on the street it has
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
not enforced and it hasn't needed to be
 
04:48:20.470 --> 04:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
enforced because people have used and
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
again sometimes it's messy but we've
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
been able to kind of make it through
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
so in my mind
 
04:48:29.910 --> 04:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
when the buffer zone law went into
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
effect seven minutes ago
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
um that's three minutes sorry seven
 
04:48:34.000 --> 04:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
um that's three minutes sorry seven
years

04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's three minutes i'm sorry
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's three minutes you're three
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
minutes later oh okay if you could just
 
04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
finish up please oh just just saying
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
that um to keep the law straight and
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
narrow keep freedom of speech and then
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
um any kind of buffer zone really brings
 
04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
the law into kind of like a playground
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
mentality and so i say repeat you know
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
repeal do this freedom act bill it's
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
just going to be freedom of speech thank
 
04:49:01.520 --> 04:49:02.310 align:start position:0%
just going to be freedom of speech thank

hi good afternoon
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
for taking the time out to
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
give me the opportunity to speak on
 
04:49:26.480 --> 04:49:27.590 align:start position:0%
give me the opportunity to speak on
behalf

04:49:27.590 --> 04:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
i am one of the sidewalk advocates i've
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
been doing this at penacook for six
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
years now
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
prior to that when i lived in texas i
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
did it for about 10 years
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
when i hear the word protest i cringe a
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
little bit because we're not protesters
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
this is different than
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
20 30 years ago when you saw people with
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
horrible signs
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
very aggressively
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
attacking women entering planned
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
parenthood facilities
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're about
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
to try to give you a picture of what the
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
sidewalk looks like
 
04:50:14.310 --> 04:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
on wednesdays which is the only day that
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
we we're there because we don't have
 
04:50:18.150 --> 04:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
enough volunteers
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's about
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
04:50:23.910 --> 04:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
people in the morning
 
04:50:23.920 --> 04:50:25.750 align:start position:0%
people in the morning
standing

04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
standing
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the planned parenthood away
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
from the driveway
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
offering help with signs that say we can
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
help you
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
please come talk to me
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
same thing happens in the afternoon we

screening
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
even if the intention is to peacefully
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
protest and i'm so happy to hear that
 
04:59:20.230 --> 04:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
there are so many members here who do
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
have lawful respectful and peaceful
 
04:59:23.120 --> 04:59:24.390 align:start position:0%
have lawful respectful and peaceful
intentions

04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
they are only individuals and they
 
04:59:28.550 --> 04:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
cannot speak for everyone if there's
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
anything that i've seen in the news over
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
the last year it's that peaceful
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
protests often escalate into
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
non-peaceful situations
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
even just a year ago in january we saw
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
what happened when a peaceful protest
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
turned otherwise i think there's a lot
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
of opportunity
 
04:59:49.110 --> 04:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
for harassment and intimidation
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
all patients have a right to access
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
health care services whatever those
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
health care services are without fear of
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
intimidation and harassment
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
this bill could have psychological
 
05:00:01.600 --> 05:00:03.030 align:start position:0%
this bill could have psychological
impacts

05:00:03.030 --> 05:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
as well as potential physical impacts on
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
patients seeking medical care no one
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
deserves to be harassed so thank you i
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
hope that you oppose this bill
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for dr tolman
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative page thank you mr chair
 
05:00:19.910 --> 05:00:19.920 align:start position:0%

05:00:22.230 --> 05:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
we heard some testimony here that folks
 
05:00:22.240 --> 05:00:23.670 align:start position:0%
we heard some testimony here that folks

will
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
stand outside facilities with signs that
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%

05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
experience
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
treating patients
 
05:00:34.560 --> 05:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
treating patients
um

05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
is is it your experience that these
 
05:00:40.788 --> 05:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
women who come for treatment have not
 
05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
gone through
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
different levels of analysis about what
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
is yeah that's an excellent question
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
i think um it's short-sighted to think
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
that women are showing up to a clinic
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
having never thought about many
 
05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
different alternatives
 
05:00:56.400 --> 05:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
different alternatives
and

05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
different courses of action and tried to
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
plan out what the best choice is for
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
them for their situation for their
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
personal health and for their families
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really challenging
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
decision it's a complex decision and
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's one that i have never really seen
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
i think it adds
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
guilt and a lot of
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
psychological weight
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
to women who have thought long and hard
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
and come to maybe a very challenging
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
decision for their family to then come
 
05:01:34.798 --> 05:01:36.310 align:start position:0%
decision for their family to then come
and

05:01:36.310 --> 05:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:38.788 --> 05:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
and have someone
 
05:01:38.798 --> 05:01:40.550 align:start position:0%
and have someone
say

05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
things that go against you know
 
05:01:43.360 --> 05:01:45.190 align:start position:0%
things that go against you know
potentially

05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
options that they've considered
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
um i think it can be very traumatizing
 
05:01:50.470 --> 05:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
especially for situations that we've
 
05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
heard about today for victims of sexual
 
05:01:55.510 --> 05:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
abuse for victims of incest there are
 
05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
situations in which
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
an alternative can not really be an
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
option for someone there's also i would
 
05:02:01.920 --> 05:02:02.868 align:start position:0%
option for someone there's also i would
just

05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:02:04.150 --> 05:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
again say that there's medical
 
05:02:06.150 --> 05:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
conditions that make it very life
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
threatening for women
 
05:02:11.270 --> 05:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
and to to hear that
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative chase
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you doctor
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
do you in your
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
opinion if a buffer was put down and
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking 25 feet do you think that
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
people could still get their point
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
across if they wanted to pray or have
 
05:02:35.670 --> 05:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
someone come over and ask for
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
information oh absolutely yes i mean
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
there are people who um
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
who speak up on either side with any
 
05:02:46.080 --> 05:02:47.110 align:start position:0%
who speak up on either side with any
opinion

05:02:47.110 --> 05:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
05:02:47.120 --> 05:02:48.150 align:start position:0%
opinion
um

05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
in front of clinics all the time and it
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
still happens even with a buffer zone in
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
other states that have had buffer zones
 
05:02:57.590 --> 05:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
this just allows the physical space for
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
patients to get into a clinic without
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
having it in their face there's still
 
05:03:04.868 --> 05:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
options if someone's on the fence and
 
05:03:06.788 --> 05:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
they end up going to a clinic and they
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
change their mind at that moment and
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's because they saw a sign
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
then then that's that's still an option
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
for them um this is just protecting the
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
immediate physical space around them to
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
protect them from
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
from that direct
 
05:03:24.550 --> 05:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
in your face contact
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you for your testimony
 
05:03:40.390 --> 05:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:40.400 --> 05:03:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
hi

05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
i'm beth scare from nashua and um
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
i'm here to ask you to vote ought to
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
pass on hb 1625 the sidewalk free speech
 
05:03:50.878 --> 05:03:53.190 align:start position:0%
pass on hb 1625 the sidewalk free speech
act

05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
act
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
seven years ago seven and a half years
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
ago then governor maggie hassan signed
 
05:03:58.628 --> 05:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
the buffer zone
 
05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill into law just over two weeks later
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
it was struck an almost identical law
 
05:04:06.550 --> 05:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
was struck down in massachusetts
 
05:04:09.030 --> 05:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
and in all this time no one's ever
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
posted his own
 
05:04:13.190 --> 05:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
so all this talk about how these buffer
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
zones are protecting women
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't exist
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
there are none
 
05:04:19.680 --> 05:04:20.708 align:start position:0%
there are none
and

05:04:20.708 --> 05:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:22.868 --> 05:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
about their concern about women being
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
blocked from accessing an abortion
 
05:04:25.120 --> 05:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
blocked from accessing an abortion
facility

05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
facility
 
05:04:27.910 --> 05:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law the freedom of
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
access to clinic entrances
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
which specifically
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
outlaws blocking access to abortion
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
facilities so no no
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
sidewalk no uh buffer zones are needed
 
05:04:44.550 --> 05:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
to prevent blocking entrances
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
and um i've been volunteering with 40
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
days for life outside planned parenthood
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
in manchester for many years
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from beth gabes it's uh
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
twice a year well we have it twice a
 
05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
for 40 days
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
and we pray we pray for the moms dads
 
05:05:05.350 --> 05:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
the abortion workers
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
and everyone who participate participate
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
signs in agreement not to do anything
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
offensive threatening
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
don't carry signs with angry messages
 
05:05:17.830 --> 05:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
block sidewalks or entrances
 
05:05:17.840 --> 05:05:19.190 align:start position:0%
block sidewalks or entrances
and

05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
we we strive to be a model to everyone
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk to be peaceful
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be a good you know we want to be a
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
good example for how to do outreach to
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
the women who are facing difficult
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
situations and the workers who are
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
working under very difficult
 
05:05:35.360 --> 05:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
working under very difficult
conditions

05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:05:39.670 --> 05:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
providing abortions
 
05:05:39.680 --> 05:05:40.628 align:start position:0%
providing abortions
and

05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
that's because that's not an easy job
 
05:05:42.638 --> 05:05:43.430 align:start position:0%
that's because that's not an easy job
when

05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know yeah what you know is
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
you have to see what happens after the
 
05:05:49.440 --> 05:05:51.110 align:start position:0%
you have to see what happens after the
abortion

05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:05:53.350 --> 05:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to point out
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
that the love ring health center the
 
05:05:56.550 --> 05:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
abortion facility
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
on the coast
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
in their own volunteer sign up sheet
 
05:06:03.430 --> 05:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
they said that they no longer need
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
escorts because
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
ever since they moved from portsmouth
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
where they had a very small lot and
 
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
crowding on the sidewalk and they move
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
to greenland on a spacious lot with park
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
adequate parking a long driveway they
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't need escorts anymore because
 
05:06:21.910 --> 05:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
they have no concerns about anyone out
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
on the public sidewalk there's plenty of
 
05:06:23.680 --> 05:06:25.030 align:start position:0%
on the public sidewalk there's plenty of
room

05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
room
 
05:06:25.040 --> 05:06:26.628 align:start position:0%
room
and

05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:28.550 --> 05:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
they what they used to have is what like
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
a quality health center has now what was
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth is what they're suffering
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
now in concord with a very crowded
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
sidewalk no parking for their um
 
05:06:38.000 --> 05:06:39.350 align:start position:0%
sidewalk no parking for their um
patients

05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:06:39.360 --> 05:06:40.390 align:start position:0%
patients
and

05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's every minute okay and you know
 
05:06:44.390 --> 05:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing's happening in planned
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
parenthood so all i would say is
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
if a business needs space i
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
highly recommend they get a bigger space
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
get a bigger lot
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
put some space between themselves in the
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
sidewalk and let law-abiding citizens
 
05:07:00.628 --> 05:07:00.638 align:start position:0%
have their free speech on the sidewalk
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%

heard about the
 
05:09:08.868 --> 05:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional article 30 and of course
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
the second or the first amendment in the
 
05:09:12.230 --> 05:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
u.s constitution but we also have the
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
right to peacefully assemble and that's
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire article 32 and of course
 
05:09:17.670 --> 05:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
the second amendment of the u.s
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
constitution again
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
the only reason this law has not been
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
struck down in new hampshire
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
is because no abortion provider actually
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
thinks it's worth putting into place
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know you um how does it make sense
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
to single out the citizens who are
 
05:09:32.798 --> 05:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
to single out the citizens who are
pro-life

05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
pro-life
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
to quell protected speech and assembly
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about public property here
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
if it's private property that's an
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
entirely different business
 
05:09:43.520 --> 05:09:44.788 align:start position:0%
entirely different business
and

05:09:44.788 --> 05:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
and that would be a different debate but
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
this is public property
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
so why should abortion providers be
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to tell members of the public
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
what they can't say on public property
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:09:59.110 --> 05:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
and what's next after that spanning
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
protesters from the sidewalks in front
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
of city hall based on what they're
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
saying if they're in favor of what the
 
05:10:06.310 --> 05:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
city is doing maybe the state house
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
so if this were any sort of issue you
 
05:10:13.750 --> 05:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
would have expected the abortion
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
facilities to have taken advantage of
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
the law to put one of these into place
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
but they haven't
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
and i've also in listening to the
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
testimony i've heard no uh quantitative
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
measures of police reports for instance
 
05:10:27.670 --> 05:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
that would actually demonstrate that
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is a real problem
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's been over seven years you would
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
expect there to be something
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i'd like to point out
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
several parallels with another debate
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
that took place in this country
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
um over what many people saw as a great
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
oppression of of silenced people slavery
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
in this case you had a well-funded
 
05:10:50.470 --> 05:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
slavery business versus mostly violent
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
volunteer abolitionists
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
um because because they had because the
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
slave business had so much uh influence
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
they were able to do things like
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
outlaw debate
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know the abolitionists were crafty
 
05:11:05.350 --> 05:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
and so they discovered that the us
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
postal service uh was a way to get
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
around this and so then the the the
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
slavery business then went
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
into congress and they had that outlet
 
05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:11:16.948 --> 05:11:16.958 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
05:11:18.550 --> 05:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
planned parenthood spends multiple
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in lobbying and
 
05:11:21.430 --> 05:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
advertising every year
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
but as far as i can tell from the
 
05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
pro-life that's three minutes thank you
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i can tell from the pro-life
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
side we are uh almost all volunteers
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so i enthusiastically asked you to
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
place new hampshire on the right side of
 
05:11:36.628 --> 05:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
history and to repeal rsa 132 37 through
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
40 by voting ought to pass on hb 1625
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for mr hennessy yes
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative chase thank you mr chair
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
you uh mentioned a couple of times about
 
05:11:55.110 --> 05:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
being silenced i don't see anywhere in
 
05:11:57.270 --> 05:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
this bill unless i'm missing it that it
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
says that you're actually being silenced
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
or that
 
05:12:03.030 --> 05:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say planned parenthood
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
is trying to silence people a buffer
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
that is not even in effect but even if
 
05:12:12.550 --> 05:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
it was is 25 feet
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's two parking spaces you're not i
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't see where silence is coming in
 
05:12:19.830 --> 05:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
here so i'd like you to either be able
 
05:12:21.510 --> 05:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
to show me that or explain it a little
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you for your
 
05:12:25.520 --> 05:12:26.310 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you for your
question

05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
so so i guess the
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
to address your question um
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that this would create a
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
barrier to entrance for by intimidating
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
people who are on the opposing side
 
05:12:45.270 --> 05:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
also even if it's just 25 feet that's 25
 
05:12:48.230 --> 05:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
feet of public space not 25 feet of
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:51.840 --> 05:12:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you for
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
i was on this committee when that buffer
 
05:13:00.310 --> 05:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
zone first passed i don't know if you
 
05:13:02.550 --> 05:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
were there but i recall some of the
 
05:13:05.350 --> 05:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
testimony from that day and the people
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
that lived across the street who i
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
believe still live there their little
 
05:13:11.430 --> 05:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
girl has grown up um i believe they said
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
that the 25 feet puts them in the middle
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
of the street
 
05:13:16.230 --> 05:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on which clinic you're
 
05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
talking about i yeah 25 feet would
 
05:13:20.240 --> 05:13:21.270 align:start position:0%
talking about i yeah 25 feet would
certainly

05:13:21.270 --> 05:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:13:25.030 --> 05:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
i believe is longer than the sidewalk
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:13:25.840 --> 05:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question

who would like to testify today on house
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:47.510 --> 05:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will declare the
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%

thank you everyone and
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
seeing no further business this
 
05:13:56.868 --> 05:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon we the committee will be in

05:14:12.718 --> 05:15:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:06.240 --> 05:15:16.868 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:32.638 --> 05:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
you have to be in this space
 
05:15:58.718 --> 05:16:34.230 align:start position:0%
you have to be in this space
is

05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:34.240 --> 05:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.798 --> 05:17:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.320 --> 05:17:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
hopefully

05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
