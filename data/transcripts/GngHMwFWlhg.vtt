00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
How would you like?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
I need some karaoke music.

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Okay, good morning everyone.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Welcome to the Committee of Conference on House Bill 211.

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm Representative Michael Bozen.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm gonna chair this Committee of Conference.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
House Bill 211 was a simple housekeeping bill.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,500
The Senate added two of its bills, Senate Bill 60 and Senate Bill 61, as amendments to the bill.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,000
The Senate has since resolved issues that it had with those two bills.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:00,500
So I'm going to ask that the Senate recede from its position of requesting an amendment to House Bill 211 and concur with the original House position.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
We concur.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Okay.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,000
And we thank you for the privilege of concurring with you.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,500
We appreciate you being here to concur with us.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Mr.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
Chair, I have a question.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:37,500
I'm interested to know, do we need to have any kind of amendment to strip those two out, or we just tell OLS to go with the underlying bill?

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Essentially, when they say they accede to the House position, that means go with the underlying bill.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Just wanted to clarify that.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Thank you.

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And the report that OLS will create is in the form of an amendment, I believe.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Is that correct?

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
We can grant.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Grant Bossey with the New Hampshire Senate.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,500
There are technically two versions of the bill before you, the House version and the Senate version.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
They have each passed one chamber and have equal standing.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:33,000
You will direct OLS to have a report that says the Senate agrees to the House position, which is the House passed bill.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
That is the extent of the report.

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
You do not need any amendments.

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,000
That's what I was thinking.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thanks for that clarification.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So we'll just have a report.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
No amendment required.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
President of the chair?

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Go ahead.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Is there just a formal concurrence or a vote required for all of us here, for the record?

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Good question.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're supposed to vote separately, as I recall.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We voted yes.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:50,500
And we can vote to accept their accession i accept you need a motion i move that we vote to accept the senate's a session okay all in favor hi hi okay all right we accept okay so we should celebrate with cake or something right yeah so I'll go over to OLS and I'll tell them what happened and they'll take it from there.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Thank you.

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Okay.

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Appreciate all your work.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Thank you.

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Thank you.

58
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
We appreciate you guys being here.

59
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Then there will be some paperwork we all have to sign.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,500
So we'll all have to sign off.

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Everybody has to sign off with OLS.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Or it's also possible, if you're not going to be here at the point when it becomes available then it's also possible to assign someone to sign it off for you usually and make sure you sign off by thursday afternoon at three o'clock no later than that so does does uh senator birdsall she has to sign she has to sign okay yep okay is she around today or no she's here but yeah It's just multitasking.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Gotcha.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is she around today or no?

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She's here, but she's just multitasking.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000

Thank you.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Thank you.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Thank you.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank you.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you.

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Thank you.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Thank you.

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you.

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you.

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you.

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thank you.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thank you.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you.

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thank you.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Thank you.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you.

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you.

244
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Thank you.

245
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thank you.

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you.

247
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Thank you.

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Thank you.

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you.

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,500
We'll now open the Committee of Conference on House Bill 607.

251
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Welcome and thank you for coming.

252
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,500
I thought we might get started by first hearing from the senators.

253
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,000
It looks like you gutted House Bill 607 and made it a very different bill.

254
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Would you care to enlighten us?

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Sure.

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So 607 was the basic equivalent of Senate Bill 120, which passed both the House and the Senate and is on its way to the governor.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
A vast majority of the provisions in 607 were already dealt with in 120.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
I think it was 120.

260
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,000
I think it was 120.

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But the one thing that we did when we raised the wagers and stakes, we didn't take into account, was what the rake was coming off the top.

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:41,000
In statute, it was fixed at 20%, which when we raised pots to 2,500, it's a $500 rake coming off the top, which makes it harder for the charitable gaming institutions to attract players with taking that much of the rake off the top.

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,500
And so what this bill does is seem to attract players.

264
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,500
We're taking that much of the rake off the top.

265
00:12:51,500 --> 00:13:04,500
And so what this bill does is seem to limit that to, again, in favor of the player who will play to give them more money.

266
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:45,500
We amended this bill because of the provisions we're dealt with in other bills that we had the rake set at 20% or a maximum of $250, dollars which is still an increase of 50 percent over the current uh rake rake which is set at a if you have at 20 or a maximum of $250, which is still an increase of 50% over the current rake, which is set at a, if you had a $500 limit, it'd be $125.

267
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:56,000
So again, it was an unintended consequence of when we changed the bet limits, how much of the rake was taken.

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That makes it so we're a little less competitive in this area.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know if Sela Deisandre wants to add anything.

270
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, I think he's gone over it comprehensively.

271
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
You know what it was.

272
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,000
You know what it is.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's the numbers.

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,500
It's the numbers that changed.

275
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:52,000
It seems to give a better situation for the player as well as for the house comments from the house side of things on the the house position the house budget how it compares to this amendment thoughts well i'd share you know where this is a totally different piece of legislation and I agree that 120 has a lot of the components.

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The most disappointing component of this is the fact that the House had a pretty clear position on the moratorium on HHR, and where that, also in SB 51, was addressed, but subsequently vetoed, it's still my position and those of others that we need to take the time to review this new game, which was inadequately reviewed.

277
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:33,500
This doesn't allow for a proper review and we don't have to relive all the testimony that we've heard on both sides of the wall.

278
00:15:33,500 --> 00:16:21,000
Fact remains is we're opening ourselves up without this moratorium on this specific game, without the ability to review its impact, most specifically on charities, but more the the the makeup and character of the state dependent on how many people apply for and receive licenses to hold this type of gaming activity i i know that we heard testimony from lottery that that no applications had come in for the last five years but if i read the governor governor's veto message on 51, apparently there's people in the queue that want these licenses.

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Gee, I wonder why that is.

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:45,500
I think we need to be a little more measured in how we look at this, specifically the moratorium, specifically taking the opportunity with the Charitable Gaming Commission and other avenues to address what I foresee as a change possibly in the character.

281
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I come from Salem.

282
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,000
It could be a change in the character of my town.

283
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Okay, it's a border town.

284
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Everybody and their brothers in there looking to get into gaming.

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay, and it's because of this specific component, and we need to tap the brakes a little bit and look at what's going on with HHR, all components being considered, and most importantly, the effect on these charities.

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Although we doubled the charities with this game.

287
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Some of those charities have taken a loss, and I'm talking specifically about these legacy charities.

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:59,500
A couple in my town that have counted on and budgeted certain dollar figures that they've grown accustomed to getting through charitable gaming have taken a loss in those specific revenues because of promises that were made specific to this game coming on board, them having to split percentages with a doubling of the charities.

289
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I don't think we've taken a good enough and and hard enough look at the impact of this game so my biggest contention here is this piece of legislation still needs to have a moratorium and it's the clear house position that that moratorium is a minimum of five years is that something the senate uh considered, well, would consider, has considered?

290
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,500
So, again, I think the veto message was pretty clear.

291
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Putting a moratorium into this bill will just be a poison pill to the bill, which will be doing a disservice to the citizens of New Hampshire, as well as the charitable gaming operators and the charities themselves.

292
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:04,000
So I think that the Senate position would be a no to adding a moratorium into the Senate version.

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And again, I think it does a disservice.

294
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We still have some time left.

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I will say that Senate Bill 51, which I was the prime sponsor on, did make it to the governor's desk and was vetoed.

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I think I set a record.

297
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,500
I had this first veto last term and this first veto this term.

298
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:48,500
But that being said, again, I think that it's important to move this legislation forward for the operators and for the charities and for the citizens of New Hampshire and the players.

299
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I do have one minor amendment.

300
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,000
Again, it had to do with Senate Bill 120.

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We had a hard effective date on that, and we wanted to put a hard effective date on this so that they marry up as we increase the wagers in 120 that this rate piece will have the same implementation date as Senate bill 120 but I think that moratorium is a hard no I will say also that I was able to get the commission that was in one Senate bill 51 into the budget so there will be a study Commission on charitable gaming that is addressing HHR and looking at that.

302
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I was going to say that we have a bill to study charitable gaming.

303
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,500
Senator Lange and I both brought in a legislation that we've morphed into.

304
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:05,000
I think points are well made, but I think looking at the big picture is very important.

305
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:23,000
As some of you know, I've been interested in gaming for a number of years and proposed a number of gaming bills that were defeated, passed by the Senate, but obviously always defeated by the House.

306
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,500
But I do believe that a strong, hard look at what's going on now is very important.

307
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:40,000
And all of the things that you mentioned have to be looked at and looked at carefully.

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What we've seen is an expansion.

309
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And as you say, some of the charities aren't doing as well as they have in the past.

310
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,500
That's a problem because the whole thing was geared around to charities receiving their 35%.

311
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,000
Bob O'Dell was very adamant about that.

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We proposed a bill from Senate Ways and Means a number of years ago.

313
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:42,500
But the fact that we're going to take a hard look at it, I think the Commission is going to be put together by the governor and we're asking that a public member, it was my intent and I hope Senator Lang agrees, that a public member be chair of the commission so you get a good broad look at a person with some experience.

314
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,500
It really all needs to be looked at and looked at carefully.

315
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:58,500
I think there's a method in place to do the kinds of things that you would like to see done.

316
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:31,500
And I recognize what's going on in salem uh i i recognize what's going on in manchester uh and uh when you look at the television and just look at the ads that are now being posted on a regular basis uh about uh about gaming and about the participation in this in this field i think all of it needs to be looked at carefully.

317
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,000
I think the commission answers your problem.

318
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:50,500
It doesn't do it immediately in terms of a moratorium, but it does address the situation, which I think it's the big picture that has to be addressed very, very carefully.

319
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Otherwise, this thing gets way out of hand.

320
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:03,000
That's a bad situation for New Hampshire, and I think it's a bad situation for the people.

321
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

322
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

323
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm glad to hear that you have the concern and the study committee makes sense because we don't want it to get out of hand I being also from Salem have a huge concern with this and it's almost like why are we looking at two extremes if the five-year moratorium is a non-starter the other extreme is having no moratorium especially where we recognize as you just said that we need to study this and understand what's going on.

324
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:05,500
So I would propose that let's at least put a two-year moratorium in so at least while the study commission is doing its work, we're not out in left field seeing stuff happening while we're studying it.

325
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:17,500
To be in concert and to have this sense, it's almost like we need some sort of moratorium, so let's make it two years.

326
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,000
Again, at least from my perspective, that's a non-starter.

327
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We've already been there.

328
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's a poison pill.

329
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I want to see this legislative change made.

330
00:25:30,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think if we add that provision, that is going to get us a guaranteed veto which gives us no no law to work with so i think the gaming operators and the players and the charities would prefer that we move something forward and what the senate's proposed in this bill knowing that we have a commission on the other side of this that'll will be signed into law as well.

331
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,500
It just was signed into law an hour ago.

332
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:53,500
So we know that this will be studied well, that the members of the commission is made up of a diverse group of people that have interest in both the public members, the charity members, the gaming operators, licensees, all are part of that participation to understand and get a good picture i think that adding a moratorium on top of this after would just be a non-starter we'd end up hurting both our charities and our gaming operators and our citizens and players Thank you.

333
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:06,500
When you designed Historic Horse Racing, you made sure that the towns would have absolutely no say in whether it came into their towns or not.

334
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,000
You're worried about your towns.

335
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You have gambling towns.

336
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,500
I don't have a gambling town, but it's going to be home to a very large, traffic-disturbing, people-disturbing operation.

337
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:53,000
and I don't want to see every medium-sized town in this state starting up a casino operation, which is a slots barn, because most of the smaller ones will be slots barns, just because This passes without a moratorium, and this passes, and the commission has to take that as the state of the way everything's going to be from now on in New Hampshire.

338
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Thank you.

339
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

340
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Just to review, and again, not going back into the long-winded testimony that we all heard and i guess i'm kind of confused at this point senator because you sponsored 51 sp 51 but yeah you're telling me maybe you can explain to me you just said that the charities and the operators are going to be negatively impacted by a moratorium how is that nope that's, that's not what I said.

341
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,500
That's exactly what you said.

342
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:54,000
What I said was if we don't pass this, the Senate version of the bill, the charities and the operators will be impacted because the players won't want to come in because the rake is so high.

343
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Understood.

344
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:12,500
I still maintain and agree with the senator, and I think we all agree here, that this study commission needs to be done for many aspects of charitable, many aspects of charitable gaming.

345
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:27,500
The fact that we can sit here and acknowledge that this is a component that needs to be studied, I don't think we need to kick it down the road.

346
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't think we need to weigh in whether the corner office is going to veto something.

347
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That's not how I go by when I submit a piece of legislation, nor advocate for that piece of legislation or anybody else's piece of legislation.

348
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,500
There is a system in place when a veto takes place, and in September, we'll see how that goes.

349
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:08,000
But I stand firm on the fact that this has to be a component of this piece of legislation.

350
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm feeling a little bit of an impasse here.

351
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,500
It sounds to me like we may not have agreement.

352
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:27,500
And I should mention for the record, I am involved in this industry a little bit of an impasse here.

353
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,500
It sounds to me like we may not have agreement.

354
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:43,500
And I should mention for the record, I am involved in this industry a little bit, but I'm hearing both sides here.

355
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,000
Are you hearing something different?

356
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:56,500
Do we have any chance to come together on anything or are we really at a place where we can't agree?

357
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Thoughts?

358
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:09,500
So from my perspective, again, if the House is positioned, nothing passes unless we have a moratorium, we won't have anything pass.

359
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Thank you.

360
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:45,500
so from my perspective again if the house's positions we nothing passes unless we have a moratorium we won't have anything pass um well just to the to the extent that we were talking about slot barns and and over and hhr houses just remember again by our by um rules and i believe statute there's a percentage relationship that has to occur between table games and HHR.

361
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,000
You can't have a pure HHR slot bond, right?

362
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:05,000
There has to be the ratio of money that is collected and used, which is by the number of machines, is controlled by the amount of table games that occurs.

363
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,500
And there's a ratio there.

364
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
So you can't have HHR without table games.

365
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:19,000
So just to make sure everyone's clear on the law and the regulation on that.

366
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So.

367
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There's no such thing as slots in New Hampshire, as you know.

368
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,500
So I don't want to get only corrective here, but yeah.

369
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,000
They just call them that a lot.

370
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Representative, go ahead.

371
00:32:38,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes, my newspaper said that this new place that they're building in levin and it's going to have 114 machines and i think it's something around 40 tables is that the ratio we're talking about so we're talking about revenue not numbers so you may have so it's the amount of revenue generated by table games directly relates to the amount of revenue generated by HHR.

372
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And there's a ratio, I'm not exactly sure.

373
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:26,500
The commissioners, the executive directors here, you can probably answer exactly what that ratio is, but there is a ratio between the two.

374
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,000
You can't have one without the other.

375
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:42,500
I just wanted to add something tertiary that probably nobody's come up with, but I'm sure Senator D'Alessandro has seen this happen in the past.

376
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:52,000
Mark my words that right now we used to see poker machines in the back rooms of every restaurant.

377
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
All right.

378
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:06,500
We're going to see these things in the back rooms of every restaurant unless we screw down what's going on with this as a legislature.

379
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:28,500
And we have the means to do so yeah i just um i mean let's let's remember that what governor sunu vetoed was the five year moratorium and um he voted oh he vetoed the two year oh and the specific with the political.

380
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,500
And so I want to see something pass, and I want to risk it.

381
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Right?

382
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:48,000
I want to make sure that we're not going to be our players and our citizens to take care of this.

383
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Some of them early takes care of that as it relates to the political.

384
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Well, I mean, to echo something Representative Doucette said is that we don't have to, you know, make our position based on that, right?

385
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:19,500
There are in September, once the veto comes down, there are actions that can be taken at that time to make sure this still happens.

386
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:40,500
we can have you know these changes plus the two-year moratorium and actions taken in in september could make sure that that is in place i was just wondering we have enough people in the house to pass to remove the veto.

387
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,500
I don't believe we do in the Senate.

388
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,000
Are you saying you don't?

389
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,500
Yes, I'm saying we don't.

390
00:35:49,500 --> 00:36:00,500
I know what the Senate count looks like, and I don't anticipate you'll have the votes to overturn a veto, 16 votes.

391
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
You won't get them.

392
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:44,000
And so knowing that, knowing what I know, this bill moving forward helps our charities and helps our operators helps our players helps the citizens of new hampshire and i'd like to see something move forward rather than nothing move forward well i i would certainly hope over the summer prior to veto session in september your phones will be ringing and your email boxes will be filled and you listen to your constituents and you listen to the people of the state.

393
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I've heard that before.

394
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I've heard it for the last 25 years if you listen to the public, but this legislature never listened to the public.

395
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And when you have an 80% favorability rating for a casino and the legislature votes against it, that's a problem.

396
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I think our best bet, and all of you know where I stand on the issue, our best bet is the commission to look at what's in place.

397
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And all of us know the charities have become a powerhouse in terms of this legislation.

398
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:40,500
They come every time there's a bill before us, and the legislature is cognizant of the fact that the charities are a power.

399
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,000
The situation at this point in time is how are the charities chosen?

400
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Do they get the real percentage that they're entitled to?

401
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:24,500
These are are the vital things these are the most important the most important issues and i think the commission has the power to do that the commission will be funded there's 150 000 appropriation for the commission so the commission will be able to bring ample evidence to make sure that the kinds of things that you guys are concerned about will take place.

402
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:39,500
And as I say, as you know, in 1999, Arthur Clem and I proposed a piece of legislation that would have significantly modified gambling in the state of New Hampshire.

403
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:50,500
We would have retained Rocky Camp Park, would have retained horse racing, and we would have created a scenario where everybody benefited.

404
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:58,500
The Speaker of the House refused to accept that piece of legislation, refused to accept it.

405
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:04,000
Never made a vote on it, but refused to accept it.

406
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm giving you a historical background because I was here.

407
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And 25 times since then, I've produced a piece of legislation that dealt with the kinds of things that you're talking about.

408
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:45,500
Limitations as it related to where things would be, how things would be managed, a governing process, and a sharing process for revenue that was beneficial to all of the people of the state of New Hampshire, all of the counties, all of the cities, and so forth and so on.

409
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:58,000
I think if we looked at the big picture, which is, I think, key, and the big picture is this is going to go on.

410
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:09,500
It's got to be done properly, and if there is a limitation on the number of machines, that should be put in place.

411
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:21,000
But I think the commission should be given that responsibility if we have faith in a process of trying to make that happen.

412
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And as I say, I've been around this for a long period of time.

413
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I've seen the ups and the downs.

414
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And I've seen the proliferation that everybody said wouldn't occur.

415
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's occurred.

416
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And it's occurred in places where people say they don't want it.

417
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But it's there.

418
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,500
So I think the commission is really so important.

419
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,500
I truly believe that.

420
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,000
And I think your position is yours.

421
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I appreciate that.

422
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I respect that.

423
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But I don't think the moratorium is going to be part of the deal.

424
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But I truly appreciate your sentiment and your diligent work with the part of your community.

425
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And I believe your community is in upheaval as we speak over the location.

426
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Your communities, both of them, are in upheaval over this particular issue.

427
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,500
And I hope that a commission will settle that because I have great respect for everybody in the community.

428
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:49,000
I mean, I spent some of the greatest days of my life at Rocky Camp Park, and it doesn't exist anymore.

429
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
This doesn't exist anymore.

430
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Thank you.

431
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Thank you, Madam Chair.

432
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Thank you all for your comments.

433
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,500
So what I'm hearing, but please correct me if I'm wrong, is that we are not able to agree.

434
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,000
Jennifer Foer, if you'd advise me, please.

435
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:26,000
does that mean do we do we say that in a report or we just basically end the committee of conference that we both sides cannot agree Go ahead, please.

436
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

437
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
JUST TO BE CLEAR, IT HAS TO BE A UNANIMOUS DECISION AT THE COC.

438
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,500
SO IT'S EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE HAS TO AGREE.

439
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
YES.

440
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
YEAH.

441
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:52,000
SO IF WE WERE TO PREPARE A REPORT, THEN EVERY SINGLE PERSON WOULD HAVE TO SIGN OFF.

442
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:35,500
WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THAT, IT SOUNDS off we're not even close to that it sounds like so um yes yeah that is correct um that is correct that's why i'm just you know i have the committee of conference procedures right in front of me so i can properly do this um okay so if we agree we're not in agreement i will let ols know that and there will be that would be it okay thank you all for coming appreciate that Thank you.

443
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Thank you.
