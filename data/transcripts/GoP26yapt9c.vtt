March 25th
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to get started even though
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
some members are not here yet because we
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
have um quite a few people who would
 
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
like to testify on the first bill we're
 
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning and before we start
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
that we'll start our meeting as is
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
customary by joining Henry noell as he
 
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
pledge aliance to the flag of the United
 
00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
States of America and to the Republic
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
all so we have two public hearings here
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
this morning and then this afternoon we
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
have a full committee work session on
 
00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 align:start position:0%
three bills that we heard last week this
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
morning's bills are s SP 451 relative to
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
an expedited track for certain
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
applications to the site evaluation
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee and sp540 re requiring the
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy to investigate
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
behind the meter and utility scale
 
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
energy storage so we'll start with SB
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
451 and welcome our good friend from the
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Senator David Waters to introduce
 
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
this legislation good morning Senator
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
committee Senator David Waters District
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
4 to introduce Senate Bill
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
451 relative to an expedited track of
 
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
certain applications to the site
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and I I feel like
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is the third part of our
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
Trifecta with uh House Bill 281 last
 
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
year and this year House Bill 609 and
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
now um Senate Bill 4551 and I think the
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
content of this bill looking as xited
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
track for existing facilities would be
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with you because I know
 
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
there was consideration and work put in
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
on uh this um as potentially being a
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
part of 609 but we thought it' be best
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
to have this come forward um as its own
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill which is what you have before you
 
00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh we're going to uh
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of the the reasons why um
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation was was but brought
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
forward and why it's particularly timely
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
right right now in our uh effort to make
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
sure New Hampshire is is ready for all
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
the changes in the industry uh when it
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
comes to site uh evaluation and this
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
um now uh a couple of things I will will
 
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
mention um it's anticipated that a lot
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
of the support for new and renewable
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
energy facilities will take place at
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
existing sites
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
um there's substantial funding through
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
the IRA act for these kinds of
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
transitions um some related to wind
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
energy a lot related to um hydrogen some
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
80 billion dollar would be available of
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
course small nuclear as as well so
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um funding that is now
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
available from the federal government
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
and recognizing the fact this energy
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
transition is going to need us to be
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
able to look at um site
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
evaluation a lot of the work of the SEC
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
as we've been seeing over the last few
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
few years of our work on that process is
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
on land use and uh public transparency
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
and it is felt that this um possibility
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
have expedited uh process for those
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
sites that have already gone through
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
land use uh with public transparency to
 
00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:17.879 align:start position:0%
make sure that as needed that that
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
continues in terms of transparency but
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
it might permit at existing facilities
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
some ex expeditious act action um there
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and then um thirdly
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
um having a faster uh sighting process
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
is really going to help us in terms of
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
the IRA and also the mounting
 
00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:39.639 align:start position:0%
electrification demands that we're
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
seeing as we Electrify um the uh many
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
sectors of our economy including
 
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
Transportation Home Heating and uh
 
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
energy production as well um people who
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
have substantial funding besides the
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
federal government to to put into the um
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
creation of this new electrification
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
um are looking to states to have a good
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
process where they can come make their
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
Investments as you all know I'm
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in offshore wind
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
I see enormous potential there for
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
repurposing of some of our um sites now
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
to handle uh Power coming and from
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
offshore wind also the storage of that
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
energy and also the potential production
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
of hydrogen um just as a reminder bom
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
has now approved the Final maps for the
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine looks like the auctions
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
are going to be in the um summer early
 
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
early fall and then contracts have to be
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
done within 90 days after that so uh
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
people are going to be looking to New
 
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as to Maine and
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to see what kind of
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
capacity we have for sighting facilities
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
that are related to that industry as as
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
well so what you have in the bill um
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
fundamentally um a new definition of
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
qualified expanding energy facility
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in the first page of the
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll revisit these in a moment
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and then you'll see the new timelines
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
a a a series of strike through and new
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
timelines uh bold numbers there in RSA
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
162 um H and uh places those guidelines
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the SEC to respond at certain points
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the of the process um public hearing
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
section is changed to make sure that
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
there is still adequate public hearing
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh time with these expedited um time
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
principles and then uh SEC will have to
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
update its administrative rules rules to
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
accommodate these sections in state they
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
law so if you turn to the bill you'll
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
see as I have mentioned the definition
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
qualifying um site on on page one and I
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
think very crucial negotiations around
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
on lines eight and nine on page one no
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
large existing facility name plate
 
00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
capacity um I do think we'll probably
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
want to have a little clarification to
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that that name capacity uh is
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
public so that the the public interest
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
in public hearing can know
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
about that and then existing facility
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
location or a budding um panel and then
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
the application for the certificate as
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see to make sure the certificate
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
is is uh is complete and then um on the
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
bottom of uh page two uh here are the
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
public notice um uh aspects as as well
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh and the one of our first changes from
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
60 days to 30 days um that that
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
um decision will be made that the
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
application is meets these re
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um I do think that we might
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
your committee might think about whether
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
or not we need some definition of public
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
interest as it is on line uh 29 you I
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
think you may hear about about some Curr
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about that and there there may
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
be a way to um provide some um
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
definitions to that as well on page
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
three you'll see the you know the series
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
of strikeouts 150 days to 90 days 365 to
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
180 days and this is not just to you
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
know do the old speed up of the uh
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
assembly line it's because because this
 
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
um kind of sighting application is
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
different because it's at an existing
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
site existing name plate that it seems
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
these are quite reasonable time limits
 
00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
to set there um please do note on line
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
16 on page three public information
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
session in each County um and then uh
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing you'll see on page four
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
within 45 5 days of the acceptance of
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
the application to be held at least one
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing and then looking again
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
down in lines 24 Public hearings um then
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
in in terms of an adjudicative process
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
so a lot of effort here um to make sure
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
that the public interest um is
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
accommodated in in this uh uh this
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
process um I I just you know want to
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
want to pause and say that I know that
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear some um thoughts
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
that came up uh in in the Senate hearing
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
and I think you may have heard uh in
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
your other deliberations on on
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
sighting um the debate over whether this
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
should just be for certain kinds of
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
sources um I personally feel that we
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity here to transition
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
our energy Supply to cheaper and more
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
reliable um forms but I think we need to
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
provide flexibility to the industry as
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
well I I we do have turbines that are
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
now developed that can handle both
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
natural gas and hydrogen you can put up
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
to 20% of hydrogen now into a gas supply
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
I think the potential for hydrogen
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
production related to Offshore wind is
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
is really going to be a very significant
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
significant factor so I I think um I am
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
very supportive of of maintaining the
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
kind of flexibility we have here but
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
there are some there are certainly some
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
boys say no this should just be for what
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
we now would call clean energy
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
facilities I think we need the
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility that this bill um provides
 
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.350 align:start position:0%
flexibility that this bill um provides
there

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
um I've mentioned already uh you're
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
going to hear some things about the name
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
plate um having make sure there's some
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
transparency that and and also I just
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
you know in this in this expedited
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
process just to make sure that any given
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
site if it hasn't been through
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
environmental reviews earlier because
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
it's been there for quite some time we
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that um the SEC can actually
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
do its job and the de and fishing game
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
and all the other agencies that are
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
tasked under the revision of 609 to keep
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
keep doing the work the feds require
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
them to do and then let the revised SEC
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
with this formulation for existing
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
facilities get its work done as well so
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I will stop
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
there and be glad to take any questions
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
I can answer but I got some you know
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
there's a backup team here uh who
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
certainly can speak in great detail
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
about this as well well thank you
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
Senator good introduction appreciate
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
that I do have one quick question are
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
you married to the word rep powering
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
because on line three the definition
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
qualified existing energy facility
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
expansion and repowering repowering
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
seems to mean
 
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.069 align:start position:0%
seems to mean
restarting

00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
restarting
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
or resuming
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
operation whereas
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
repowering might be interpreted by some
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
people to mean something different yeah
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
so would you
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
be amenable to a change in language from
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
repowering to maybe resuming operation
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
or uh restarting operation something
 
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.590 align:start position:0%
or uh restarting operation something
like

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that question M
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and I do think that there would
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
be ways to um be have some clarity as to
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
what that means it's not just have the
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
switches been off turned the switch on
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
the idea here is a transition to other
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
sources of energy other other means of
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
energy production so whether that is you
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
know definitionally and legally
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
repurposing that's a good idea
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
representative somethingest
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
repurposing okay we'll talk about that
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
and if I may Mr chairman I think it
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
might be useful to make sure when you
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
look at the IRA Provisions to make sure
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
that whatever language we come up there
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
um is in accordance with the kind of um
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
repowering that will make these these
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
sites potentially available for all that
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
funding is repowering Def defined in the
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
ira that's that's what I'm okay take a
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
look yeah yeah okay representative McGee
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question uh on the
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
same line that opening line where it
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
says qualified existing energy facility
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
expansion and then it goes on to say um
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
in the language of the bill that the
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
name plate capacity uh can be no larger
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
so is it is expansion the right word
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
there I'm sorry would you repeat yeah is
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
expansion the correct word if we're
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
going to be confined to the existing
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
name plate because that expansion
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
implies that you're perhaps going to be
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
expanding on the amount of energy coming
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
out of there and I know that's not my
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
only question on the bill but since
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
curious line three you know I I see just
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
see um well you know certainly a a given
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
there may be a name capacity which is
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
basically what the interconnection
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
capacity can take right and that to me
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
when that was suggested seemed to be key
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
because that that's the point isn't it
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
and it's not I mean yes how you produce
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
the power but how much power can you get
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
off a given site now I it may be that an
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
existing facility has never generated up
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
to the name the interconnection capacity
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
so I think it's quite reasonable to say
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
well if you've got the interconnection
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
capacity why not be able to use it so I
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
think that's why that word expansion is
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
is recognized as that kind of situation
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense thank you
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
further questions for the senator
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh yeah so with lines
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
um 789 on page one y uh continuing on
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
that I I I guess I'm a little unclear
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
when it says uh expansion shall be no
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
larger than the existing facilities name
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
plate capacity is what we're really
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
talking about here is that the
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
additional energy produced is no more
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
than what's being produced now that
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to at most double what's
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
coming out of that site is that the
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
right way to interpret it thanks for
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
your question I think the right way to
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
interpret is how much existing name
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
plate capacity recognizes um the
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
interconnection as I understand it so
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
that really it's it's a matter of we're
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to just make sure that we're
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
within the interconnection capacity
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
right okay I think we'll have some more
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
technical am I basically okay on that
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay I think we'll have some some
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
further uh talk from the folks who you
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
know understand that what the name plate
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
is and I think that's just I may say I
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
think that that's a reason why it would
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
be good to have some transparency about
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
just what is that name capacity so
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
people know what we're what we're
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
talking about I mean so you can say
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
let's say that's a they can take a
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
thousand megawatts and come off the site
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
but the facility that's there now only
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
produces 800 well they go up this says
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you can you you know the new the
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
new facility that you build replace the
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
old one of a different fuel source you
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
can power you can power that up have
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient turbines to get the amount of
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
power you can get off the site follow up
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um and
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
then an issue I brought up when I
 
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill in front of the
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
Senate was uh this question about the ab
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
buding parcel and I suggested that there
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
be some sort of uh limitation on the
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
size of the abing parcel relative to the
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
original parcel you know imagining some
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
weird scenario where you have a
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh Power Plant on one acre and there's a
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
Thousand Acre or budding parcel I know
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen but the point
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
is I it seems like you need some sort of
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
limitation on the size of the abing
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
parcel thanks for your question you know
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
my my sense is that why would we want to
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
prejudge that if you were to imagine a
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
kind of an energy Park that would have a
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
generation capacity run by some kind of
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
supply but let's say you also had 100
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
acres of solar that might be there or
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
let's say you wanted to have some pretty
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
substantial battery storage now those
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
might be on a budding parcels and be
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
part of this this mix and then you might
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
have a s a plant as well so I I I'd
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
rather have that I to me it seems to
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
make sense not to say well it can be 20
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
acres but not 25 acres that have it
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the project which of
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
course is going to get public hearing
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki has a question uh
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
um I have a recollection that we had a
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
house bill that was going to actually
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
make it so that the SEC was no longer
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
effectively a phantom committee where
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
somebody would answer the phone and then
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
somebody would be at least administer it
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
and um I'm wondering how this uh bill um
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
relates to that you know is there is
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
somebody going to answer the phone is
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
somebody going to make meetings happen
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and so forth because without that uh
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
basis at the SEC you can't do much uh
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question representative
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
so um I think there's been good
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
coordination here mean this committee
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
did Fabulous work on HB 609 with the
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
revision of SEC and this bill was
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
developed by becoming a revision to 162
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
H7 to kind of fit into what is being
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
being done in House Bill 609 which did
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
Fe receive a very favorable Hearing in
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
the in in a senate so I I I've said at
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
the start I think we really have you
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
know this Trifecta where we've moved
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
from 281 609 and now this bill kind of
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
to to come to to work together so I I
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
think we're I think we're good but I'm
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
sure there'll be some pretty good eyes
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
on this to make sure that we did do
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
things in accordance with
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
609 representative Kaplan has a question
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
for coming in um this might be a simple
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know but it doesn't
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
seem to be a deadline for decision-
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
making by the committee on on the bill
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that is that incorporated in HB 609
 
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
or am I missing something shouldn't
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
there be a deadline for an expedited
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
process for decision-
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
making well that process under 609 has a
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
certain set of deadlines and now this
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
process because it's for existing
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
facilities is proposing the numbers that
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
you see
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
here for clarification on page three
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
lines 8 and n say within 180 days of the
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
acceptance of an application the
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee shall issue or deny a
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
certificate for an energy
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
facility representative Thomas Vice
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas has a question thank you Mr
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
question uh at the risk of that last
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
question that might have answered the
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to ask but I I'll
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it differently um I could do
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the math running through the dates that
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
are changeed to make things faster but
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
overall overall how much faster does
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
this bill make that decision- making
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
process as opposed to the way it is now
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious is it three months six
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
months well you know or ask question
 
00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:42.630 align:start position:0%
months well you know or ask question
question

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
um this is going to be new so it's hard
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
to say and we haven't had you know
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
applications to the SEC for a little
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
while we've been in this you know
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
fortunate and this little kind of a
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
pause so we had chance to do this
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislation so it's hard to predict just
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
just what this will mean but I think
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
that when I mentioned you know plan
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
owners or potential investors or funding
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
under the IRA that anybody who now comes
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
in can look at this and will be able to
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
see we at least know that this step this
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
step and this step we can have responses
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
to so where the timeline ends I it
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
depends a lot of factors I mean let's
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
say at the start they say well your
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
application is not complete and so you
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
have to revise that or you know when it
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
does get into the SEC portion of the
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearings that those will
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
will play out I do think that you know
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
we will see some stability of timeline
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
here and particularly in the early
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
phases um see that things that maybe
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
used to take a whole lot longer because
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
their existing facilities can be
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
expedited representative Ms has a
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and um thank
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my questions and
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
my apologies for coming com in near the
 
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:01.559 align:start position:0%
end of your testimony if somebody
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
already asked this question feel free to
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
just say that they have and I'll get the
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
answer for my colleagues but on page
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
four um uh lines 3 through six um it the
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill deletes existing language and
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
statute that um if I read it right
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
allows the um the governing board of a
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipality where one of these
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
facilities is located to request the
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
separate public
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
meeting um why is that being taken
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
out um I may not give the absolutely
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
correct answer on this but I think that
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
this actually reflects what is being
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
done in
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
609 um and that um because we have
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
the I mean this I mean the SEC is a
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
state process and I think we decided um
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
I think Mr chairman thinking back to two
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
summers ago in that that study committee
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
that the feeling was that over a certain
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
size um it is the state's purview under
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
a certain size the town can is is more
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
involved um and it does not require that
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
state review and this recognized these
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
facilities are going to serve the whole
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
state not just one uh M
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
municipality that
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
said under existing Federal requirements
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
which we reflect in statute the dees
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
process the fishing game process the do
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
process all involved hearings in which
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
local people can you know the
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
municipality can be involved and then
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see in this bill a little bit
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
further down each
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
County the public
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
process the adjudicative public hearings
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
so I think that's why this is saying
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
this is the SEC is a state process for
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
for energy facility sighting and I think
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
that needs to be clear where those lines
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
it representative Corman has another
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
you again uh I have a couple of
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
questions about specific wording on page
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
two um one very minor thing on line
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
27 um where uh it says uh one or more
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers having a regular circulation
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
in the county in which the facility is
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
located um later on though apparently
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
there's the possibility of multiple
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
counties so we might want to say each
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
County something like that perhaps
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps um but my real question is on
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
lines 29 through
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
32 um and it's that uh actually the
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
bolded language and that the application
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements of uh RSA
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
whatever relative to a qualified
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
existing energy facility expansion and
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
repowering um not everything is going to
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
meet that but this statute is really for
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
um for allsite evaluation so I'm I'm a
 
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
little confused um it seems like there
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
should be something saying that you know
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
if the application meets it then certain
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
things happen I'm just a little confused
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question I'm not
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
sure whether I'll I mean this is
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
something maybe we can puzzle out I my
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
reading of this is
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
that um this is amending some existing
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
language so that it needs to have that
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that the application meets this
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
requirement and that's and within 30
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
days of filing so that that that to me
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
is what
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
kicks the the I mean I think that bold
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
phrase is what becomes dependent upon
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
the 60 going to the 30 right there um
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that we you know the public interest
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
is important and that that's something
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
that should be perhaps defined um but
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
also because this is creating this new
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
section under 162 that that reference to
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
it needs to be included because these
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of existing sites that
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I hope that's clear
 
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
enough but if not I think maybe you can
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
again yeah go ahead yeah maybe maybe
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
during our work session we can try to
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
clean it up and make clear you know what
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
applies to um the expedited review and
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
what what doesn't right again because
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
this this particular section of of the
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
law applies to all review not just
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
expedited um we just need to make clear
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
when when when when is it expedited when
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
not yeah if I if May um yes I think this
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
is something you could talk about some
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
more representative and thanks to the
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up question but do note that what
 
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up question but do note that what
it

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
says I mean your question about what
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
that this applies to qualified well this
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
is referring back to that new section on
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
page one lines 3 to n right I mean
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's what it says it's the new um xi-
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
you know ROM 11- a so that that's that
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
that seems to me to be the delimiter and
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
the guard rail for this aspect of the
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
SEC expedited process so anyways I mean
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
think about it but I I think that's why
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's I think that's that is meant to be
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
the delimitation is back to that
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
definition I made a note to double check
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
that reference when we have our work
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
session so we'll do that further
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
senator uh representative Corman thank
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
you again uh another question I had was
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
I noticed that the um the public hearing
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
within the public info session excuse me
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
is within 30 days of acceptance and then
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
the uh site evaluation Committee hearing
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
is within 45
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
days but I don't see anything that says
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the public info session should
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
preedee the public hearing and it seems
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.269 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
yeah make a note of that we'll we'll
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
look into that as
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
well representative McGee just was
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
thinking um is there any uh reason that
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
we should include in um language that
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
states that we should be looking at um
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
facilities that were cited before the
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
SEC certificate process was
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
available cuz I think that's been
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
brought up in conversations that I've
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
been privy to and I'm just wondering
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
whether they're whether that might be
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
beneficial in the
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
language thanks for your question
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
um you know if that is a concern on a
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
given facility to which this might apply
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
there might be some way
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
to um suggest that if that is the case
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
that there there be a recognition of uh
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the appropriate
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
review and I follow up and I think um my
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of why that's being
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
brought up is that there may be existing
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
um facilities that have never gone
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
through a fome process and so even
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
though they'd be applying for a FasTrack
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
they would still hopefully need to you
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
know pass through the same Gauntlet as
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
other plants that have had SEC
 
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.710 align:start position:0%
other plants that have had SEC
certification

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
since thank you perhaps I me this is
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
you know I mean it's to as I if I just
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
made kind of my mind of just thinking
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
about it that um we I think New
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has done a you know the
 
00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
department of environmental service and
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
the other folks who need to look at the
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
environmental review do a very good job
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
um I would like to think that this
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
process here suggests when does it
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
become necessary to do what and
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
that I brought this spill for because I
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
am deeply concerned with our coming
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
electrification and the to the extent we
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
can de decarbonizing certain aspects of
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
the economy or transition to to um lower
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
CO2 impact fuels and then you know as
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
we're all know where we're moving and
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
with the hydrogen and battery storage
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
and officer I mean all all this and
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
solar you know um that that we be able
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
to get there and and and I just think
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's so important I think that's why I
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
I keep repeating 281 609 this bill New
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to be at a place where
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
it can
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
achieve the benefits to our consumers of
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
a more reliable cheaper I think supplies
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
of of energy and be able to provide a
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
process where investors and federal
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
grants can can come into the
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
state and I I mean you know as long as
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking about these issues
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
this is back to the 7
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the the potential for us to
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
transition and to get cheaper supplies
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
of of energy into the state we have
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
often had a lot of problems over that
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
whether it's generation or transmission
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes with good reason you know
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
some bad things were proposed um and
 
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes and and so on but uh we got to
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
protect the taxpayers but we we've got
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to we've got to be able to
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
get this energy transition moving we
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
have the we have the ability here with
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
some existing fac facilities that could
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
really be leveraged and advantaged to
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
help us in this process and that's why
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
this bill's here and I would I would it
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
would really I think be very despairing
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
for all of us who share these energy
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
goals and investment goals to see that
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
we create a FastTrack process which
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
really isn't a fast trck and that's
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
that follow up yep so that I mean I
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
share all your concerns and I think
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're all looking to figure out how we
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
can uh assist with transition and it
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
makes that all makes perfect sense I
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
guess the question is just to the
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
specific aims of the language in this
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
bill whether or not there needs to be
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
any type of distinction between plants
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
that have already undergone an SEC
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
process for fast tracking and plants
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
that never have whether they're all in
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
the same category in terms of us wanting
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to to FastTrack them or
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
whether there should be some distinction
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
for those that haven't had the benefit
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
of Dees or anyone looking at the aspects
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
that have been looked at your question
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
let me just give one last little take on
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
that I I being very much a pragmatist I
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
would rather than try to create some
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
language that carves out just what are
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
we talking about in a not review and so
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
on to have it be that this adequate
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
language that in a the case by case
 
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
basis that is the proposal that would
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
help determine as we see in the first
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
part of this bill the F of the app
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
apption all the things that has to do
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
right there that that to me it seems
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
would cover the questions that are
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
raised about whether it's had adequate
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
review before and that would be part of
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
the the process so maybe a little slight
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
language that recognizes that but I I
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
don't I I would not think a separate
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to Define what's in
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
what's out would would would be very
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
very practical I I'm not just not sure
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
how we do it so existing is the larger
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
bucket and it also it contains SEC
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
approved and non SEC C certified is what
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
you're saying existing just means if if
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
it's there we'll
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
see I mean you know you there's a lot of
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
wisdom in this committee and I I think
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
if this is an issue you'll work on
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
it representative Kaplan has a question
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you m uh
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
Senator once again and I know you're a
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
busy man you've got places to go and so
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
I won't be labor at the point but uh and
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
you you might repeat some of the things
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
you just said but what you did recognize
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
that one of the likely sticking points
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
would be defining public interest uh and
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
so as somebody who's a pragmatist and
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
and is known for balancing different
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
interests could you leave us some
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
thoughts as to what you think the public
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
interest might be thanks for your
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
question um you know I I think I haven't
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at this but I think
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
we probably have some pretty good
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
definition of a public interest in
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
existing statute and existing energy
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
stat maybe there'd be a way to reference
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
that um my own feeling is that the
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
public interest is that we in this state
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
is we all we want to keep costs low we
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
want to take care of the the the the the
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
consumer and we um recognize that there
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
are um you know certain goals in terms
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
of uh pollution and environmental issues
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's public interest as well and I
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
personally think of there's a compelling
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
public interest that New Hampshire be
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
able to participate in the energy
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
way echoing uh representative kaplan's
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
comment that that you're a busy man and
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
you uh need to move on and also that
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
there are other people who want to
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
testify I want to ask you to give us one
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
last thought uh before we let you go and
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
this since it looks like the Senate is
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
probably going to pass HB
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
609 and between 281 and 609 we now have
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
a fairly sign significantly changed SEC
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
process in place do we need to give that
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
process time to prove that it works
 
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
before we make further changes to the
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
process that's kind of a philosophical
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
question and I'd love to hear your take
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
on it thank you Mr chairman you know
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
frankly I think that this bill if we
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
pass it and the projects that might
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
arise from it will actually be the the
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
test case or the proof as to whether 281
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
and 609 will work because these are
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
likely to be the first ones that come
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
forward and there's a timeliness issue
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
here too that that money in the IR act
 
00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:30.349 align:start position:0%
here too that that money in the IR act
those

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
investors that money can just flow quite
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
nicely to other states and to other
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
projects and um I think would be just
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
really really harmful to the to the
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
consumers in the state if we couldn't
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that funding and um so
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
I I mean I think I think we'll get what
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
we want in terms of the SEC process how
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
does it work do we do the right thing
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
when we when the projects that would be
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
affected by 451 come forth cuz they're
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to be first in line M as far as I
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
could tell so that's my answer okay
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
great answer thank you and thank you
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
senator for introducing this legislation
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
to us thank you let's move along now and
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
hear from some other folks who I'm sure
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
have uh important perspectives to shed
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
some light on this legislation let's
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
hear next from James Andrews of granite
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
Shore power in
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
st&amp; thank you chairman BOS morning
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
morning committee members uh my name is
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
James Andrews I'm president and CEO of
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
granite Shore power and bo uh testifying
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of s SP
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
451 as an asset owner and developer I
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
hope my views on the sighting process
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
will be helpful and illustrate how
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
sighting reforms May accelerate the
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
sighting success and completion of clean
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
energy projects we all seek to
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
advance if New Hampshire is going to
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from the energy transition and
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
clean alternative energy opportunities
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
not only decarbonization efforts but
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
also economic growth it is imperative
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the state encourage Capital be
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
invested directly in New Hampshire to
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
support infrastructure projects that
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
starts with an efficient sighting
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
process granted Shore Powers generating
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
stations are essential resources within
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
ISO New England assuring reliability
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
reliable electricity to the families and
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
businesses of New Hampshire when needed
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
most our generating Fleet serves an as
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
an essential Bridge transforming to the
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
next generation of energy resources in
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from our earliest days
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
gsp's message has been consistent and
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
clear we strongly support such a
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
transition and will play an important
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
role providing power to businesses and
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
families in our region during that
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond the question is how do we get
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
over this imaginary bridge and execute
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
the transition that is so
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated there is an abundance of
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
projects developers are seeking to move
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
forward with that are aligned with grid
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
transition and the electrification of
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
the economy the iso New England
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue is replete with
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
interconnection requests for wind solar
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
and Battery
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
projects from a policy standpoint the
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act or IRA has
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
created attractive tax and borrowing
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
incentives clearly these projects are
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
penciling out and there is an urgency to
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
get them done but why then are so few
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
being completed in my opinion the
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
sighting process lacks efficiency
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
creating time delays and adding risk to
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
projects that may otherwise be avoided
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
particularly for sites with existing
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I have said before New
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is well suited to take
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of the energy transition
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities New Hampshire has highly
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
qualified trade professionals and
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
educational institutions a favorable tax
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
climate to compete for the businesses
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
that will support these projects and
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
most importantly it's existing major
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure necessary to transition
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
the region to the next generation of
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
energy resources and finally got across
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
that bridge if New Hampshire is serious
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
about advancing clean energy projects
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
within the state it is imperative this
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
legislation be Advanced to make the
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
sighting process more efficient for
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
sites with existing or adjacent
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that are best suited for
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
critical projects that may be completed
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
quickly with the enactment of the IR and
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
the continued shift toward an
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
electrified economy developing OnDemand
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
generation resources is more feasible
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
now than ever to assure electric
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
reliability for new
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
englanders development at Legacy sites
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
will greatly enhance the utilization of
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
existing interconnection at the
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and Advance the Region's
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
overall generation mix and not
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
inadvertently kill projects that we all
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
seek to be completed we strongly support
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
pass passage of this legislation and
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank the bill sponsors and co-sponsors
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
for their
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
leadership thank you for the opportunity
 
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
to provide our views and I'll now take
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have questions for
 
00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:20.230 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have questions for
Mr

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
Andrews representative McGee thank you
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr Andrews for
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just curious
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
curious if if at this point Granite
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
Shore is is poised to actually present
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh one of these FastTrack projects if
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're actually in a in a position where
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
you would be looking to come in front of
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
the commission with it yeah I think it's
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
fair to say uh representative that since
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh first days of ownership we've been
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
looking at projects and are now poised
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh to to move forward with projects um
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
very early on in my tenure I took a trip
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
to Denmark with uh Ambassador sweat
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
looked at offshore wind projects and how
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
that may impact uh you know New England
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
region and and New Hampshire
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
specifically given our advantages um and
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
we've looked at a lot of things and and
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
we are poised and ready to move
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
forward thank you additional questions
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas thank Mr chair thank
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I'll kind
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
of ask you the same question I asked
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters but I'll ask you
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
differently in terms of investors what
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
type of in of efficiency are they
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
looking for to come to New Hampshire are
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
we looking in terms of a timeline are we
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
looking at something that's 25% quicker
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
50% quicker uh what what's your take on
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
that I I think it's more a matter of uh
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
drisking uh the process for Capital
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
right now the the process is so lengthy
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and so cumbersome uh for new
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
sites that frankly
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
as you put forth a project and you put
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
forth the economics you put forth the
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
technology by the time you get through
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
the SEC process a lot of those things
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
have changed and you have to go back and
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
you you're in frankly this endless loop
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
and you can never get a project done
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
because that process is too long um so
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
it it it really comes down to drisking
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
the timeline right Capital moves pretty
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly with speed uh when it's
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
committed so uh enabling that to happen
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
I think is is a is a is a wise thing to
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative licki has a
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Mr Andrews uh
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned on demand and which I
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
could you be more specific as to which
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
types of energy can be done on demand uh
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
you know whether um
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
and uh because that's a real sticking
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
point for a lot of us because if it
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
really truly is not on demand then it's
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
not um you know basically we still need
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
the base
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
load uh I think what you're finding is
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's going to be a
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
significant need for on demand
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
resources uh with the renewable uh Basel
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
load facilities that we expect to come
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
online Senator Waters mentioned uh the
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
offshore wind lease areas uh bom is
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
going forward with uh you know this fall
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and those facilities out there on
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
demand resources would be things like
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
battery storage or quick start CTS that
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
when those are unable to uh function uh
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
as that base load there's going to be
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
something that's going to need to
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
supplant that uh very quickly uh and
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
those are the type of resources uh on
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
demand resources that we're talking
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
um if you're talking about Renewables I
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
don't know how you could be talking
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
about Basel load the output from
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
Renewables Is
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
Random so you know you can build a
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
battery system on top of that I mean I
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
guess maybe that's what you're talking
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
about but I mean to talk about
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
Renewables and base load in the same
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
sentence I think is an
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
error maybe you misunderstood my my
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
comment cuz uh wind and solar are
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
inherently not reliable right those
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
aren't on demand resources uh it takes
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
the wind or it takes the sun to shine
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about are resources
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
that support those types of resources
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
that enable those projects to happen uh
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
but also in a in a carbon neutral
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
way follow up so to be clear you're
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
talking about energy storage you're
 
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
talking about batteries or something
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
else pumped Hydro who knows what um
 
00:47:56.319 --> 00:47:57.430 align:start position:0%
else pumped Hydro who knows what um
specifically

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh energy storage from a but also uh
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
there are you know Green LNG uh or green
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
gas uh turbines that can be used that
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
well representative lii has another
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you this is more of a
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
followup to my previous question um what
 
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
is the state of Battery Technology I
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
know I had co-workers from a previous
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
job who went to work for Ambry and
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
locked Martin and so far I haven't seen
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
anything come from those is there any
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
true battery grid scale
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
storage there is uh there's a number of
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
grid grid scale storage projects uh
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
country representative Kennedy has
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
another question yeah my last one thank
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um you you said you have
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
a project that's ready to go what is
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
it uh that is a battery storage
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.069 align:start position:0%
it uh that is a battery storage
project

00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.079 --> 00:49:00.430 align:start position:0%
 
additional

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we want to thank
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr Andrews for being here all right
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you okay next we'll
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
hear from Nick coff of the conservation
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
back

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
hey good morning um my name is Nick cof
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
with the conservation law Foundation
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for having me here this morning
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
um I agree with the chief sponsor uh
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters that we need to reform
 
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
existing sighting laws to support clean
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure development in the
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
state um I guess I have several concerns
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
with with the bill I'm going to address
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
them here this morning um f first off
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
under the bill um the powering of an
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
existing facility would be subject to
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
this new expedited sighting track and um
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
you this could result in the repowering
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
of an existing fossil fuel plant with
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
another type of fossil fuel so like a
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
coal plant with natural gas or something
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
um which could result in significant
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts U particularly
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
emissions water impacts Etc and so you
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
know where there's a potential for you
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
know the significant impacts like this
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
um I think it behooves us to to really
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
limit this expon track to to clean
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
energy technologies that have um lesser
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and impacts in
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
general um and you know as as
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee said a few minutes
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
ago I agree that there is a concern
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
about um facilities that were
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
constructed in the
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
1960s um before the current sighting law
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
was enacted that have not been through
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
the rigor of the existing sighting
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
process and so it is a concern that some
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
some of those older
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
facilities um went went through a
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
process before most environmental laws
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
were were even passed so the 1960s was
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
was before many um of the key
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
environmental laws were passed that
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
those facilities might be modified
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
without really going through the full
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
rigor of a sec process um under this
 
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.950 align:start position:0%
rigor of a sec process um under this
expedited

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
expedited
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
track second um I wanted to address the
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
public interest standard that's um
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
required under the um under s451 as a by
 
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
required under the um under s451 as a by
the

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
Senate um for for an application for the
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
expedited sighting track there's this
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
public interest required public interest
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
finding on page
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
two um lines 26 or sorry lines 29
 
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.789 align:start position:0%
two um lines 26 or sorry lines 29
through

00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
32 and I think that needs to be better
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
defined and clarified I would suggest
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
using the definition of public interest
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
that is in RSA 162 H1 that has some
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
criteria there that's the existing
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
sighting law um that has some criteria
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
there for public interest I think it's a
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
pretty well balanced um standard for
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
what public interest is and I think
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
public interest is kind of an a morphous
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
context without a clear definition I
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
think if you pull a members of this
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
committee you could get 20 different
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
definitions of public interest so I
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
think providing some clarifications on
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
that definition would be helpful um and
 
00:52:16.789 --> 00:52:16.799 align:start position:0%
along those lines I think there should
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
be a means for parties that are
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
negatively impacted by this expedited
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
setting track to to challenge that um
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
and I I think you could apply RSA 541
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
which provides some um some due process
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
protections for for potentially agreed
 
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
Parties By by the EXA sighting track
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
under this public interest standard um
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then but lastly I just wanted to
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
address something that Senator Waters
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
said about the sort of interconnection
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
versus name plate capacity
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
standard with name plate capacity it's
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy to find what that means
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
I can spend one minute do one minute of
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
research find out what the name plate
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
capacity is for CBR station for marac
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
station Etc um with interconnection
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
capacity I you know it's that's hard to
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
find that's not publicly accessible that
 
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
information so I don't really know what
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
we're getting with with that if if we go
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
with interconnection capacity is that is
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
that a huge increase over name plate
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
capacity or is it the same it's it's
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
just not there's no transparency with
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
that definition and so I think before we
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
change that definition around to
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
interconnection capacity we need to
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
think about how we can ensure there's
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
transparency so that we know what we're
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
getting with with this potential bill um
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
those are all my comments happy to
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
answer anybody's questions and happy to
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
work with sponsors and all of you all to
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
try to improve this Bill thank you thank
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
you good comments we appreciate those
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
crof representative Thomas has one thank
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
cof for being here it's good to see you
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
up and about um I I see with this bill
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of uh there's public
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
input um however in the application the
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
the uh items that are included in the
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
application there's nothing that that
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses uh public input
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about public interest
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
but input which can include things like
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
roads neighborhoods and potential toxins
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
would you be open to including that as
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
part of the application going forward
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I think there should be some
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to at least comment on the
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
application you know whether meets the
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
public interest standard um I understand
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to create a lengthy
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
process but at least some opportunity to
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
comment uh whether in written comments
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
or um verbal comments I think would be
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to to ensure that those voices
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
are heard thank you additional questions
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Koff good to see you
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
again um I uh take um the sponsors point
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
that we have to have flexibility in a
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
allowing um businesses to figure out
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
what composite of energy transition is
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to make their plant work um but I
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
was wondering in the definition around
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
public interest whether we might include
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
specific language about lowering harmful
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
emissions in terms of a transition that
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
benefits the public because it it gets
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
us off an emissions curve that you know
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
has been going up um so I wonder what
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
what you think about us having any type
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
of specific language in that regard
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
because I think if there was a need to
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
do combined cycle or or some type of
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
energy solution that included Renewables
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
but also had some other um some other
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
components uh rather than saying it has
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
to be clean or nothing we could say as
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
long as it significantly lowers right
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
the TR the point of the transition is to
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
lower emissions so do you think there
 
00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
should be language in here that is
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
specifically alludes to that yeah I mean
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be helpful to have language
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
like that that ensures that um you know
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
the impacts of emissions are are lesser
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
than than current you know what exists
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
currently um and I think that's one way
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
to do it I mean I think you can play
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
around with the public interest criteria
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
162 H1 but yeah I think that would be
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
that further
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none let's get the
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
perspective of the
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
existing site evaluation committee we'll
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
call on the administrator of the SEC
 
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:38.349 align:start position:0%
call on the administrator of the SEC
Drew

00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
Beamer good morning
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
you today I'm here to to share my
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
perspective on Senate Bill
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
451 a measure aimed at streamlining the
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
process for repowering retrofiting or
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
repurposing existing sites particularly
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
those under the jurisdiction of the site
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee or those predating
 
00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:12.390 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee or those predating
its

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:57:14.109 --> 00:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
establishment I want to start by
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
emphasizing my Firm support for the core
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
principles of SB
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
451 as someone deeply immersed in these
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
processes I understand the critical need
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
for simplifying
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
them um especially in the realm of
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
advancing sustainable energy initiatives
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
modernizing outdated generation
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
facilities resonates strongly with me
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
and I commend the efforts to facilitate
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
such transitions initially my position
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
on SB 451 was very straightforward I
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
think I just said I like it three words
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
in the Senate however as the bill
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
progressed through the public hearing to
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the executive session there was an
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that significantly reduced the
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
timelines outlined within the
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and while I remain a
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
proponent of streamlining processes in
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
general I have reservations about the
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
potential impact of the bill as amended
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
on public engagement it's vital that we
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
afford the public ample time and
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in these
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
discussions additionally I'm personally
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
grappling with ambiguity of the term
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
repowering that we've mentioned earlier
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
here today clear and precise legislative
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
language is essential to ensure that
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
your intent Endo across future
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
generations of regulators and
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
administrations in tandem with our
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
discussions on SB 451 House Bill 609 is
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
on the brink of becoming
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
law thanks to the dedicated efforts of
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
this committee and your counterparts in
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate House Bill 609 represents a
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
significant stride towards efficiency by
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
reallocating existing Personnel
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
Resources instead of creating new ones a
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
true embodiment of the small government
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way while I have
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
confidence in our ability meaning my
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
ability to implement any devised system
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
I urge caution in hastening the
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
adjustment of Permitting
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
timelines let us perhaps first navigate
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
the Post House Bill 609 landscape before
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
revisiting this aspect of the
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
legislation it's crucial to remember
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
that Simplicity does not always equate
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
to speed
 
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:29.039 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I reiterate my support for
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
the overarching goals of this bill while
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
advocating for prudence and Clarity in
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
its execution thank you for your
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
attention and I'd love to take any
 
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.510 align:start position:0%
attention and I'd love to take any
questions

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
excellent questions for Mr Beamer
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Beamer good to see
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
you here thanks for taking my question
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay so you're alluding to um concerns
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
around the
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
expedit timelines that appear throughout
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
the bill the 60-day to 30-day the 90day
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
right they're all kind of chopped in
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
half Are there specific areas of the SEC
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
process that are outlined here where you
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
think that the numbers that have been
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
attributed are too scant and need in
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
other words are there specific ones that
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
you believe that you cannot accomplish
 
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
within the number that set on the page
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
that need to be expanded uh it's it's
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily about believing that I
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
can or can't accomplish them I'm pretty
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
confident that we can accomplish
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
anything that that you folks devise the
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
issue is that uh from a public
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
perspective um I think that the public
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
um in the sort of cascading way that
 
01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
these permits
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
unfold um we need to make sure that they
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
have ample time to weigh in in the
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
process and I'm just envisioning in my
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
mind the 45 day timeline to have a
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
public meeting for the SEC and my
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
opinion on the matter is that um there's
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
no such thing as too much public input
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
um anybody who wants to weigh in should
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
be given every opportunity to do so and
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'm envisioning a scenario where perhaps
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
40 days into a 45 day timeline uh we get
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
back something from you know Sister
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
agency that's a key component of the
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
permitting and then the public has five
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
days to ostensibly read something before
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
formulating a uh coherent opinion so um
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that that will happen I'm
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
saying that it could happen and um in my
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
experience as far as speed goes um if
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this as an expedited
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
process I'm wholly supportive of the
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
idea of you got 10 boxes to check let's
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
cut it down to five if you're taking a
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
coal plant you're turning it into
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
something Greener and cleaner uh with
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
similar base load capacity let's take
 
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
those 10 let's chop it down to five make
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
it easier but easier does not
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
automatically mean faster and and I'm
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
confident in my agency's ability to
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
expedite anything I am just um putting
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
my public participation hat on which is
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the world I came from before I
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
was here so
 
01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
um you know if there was a if there was
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
an extremely compelling reason to
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
shorten the timelines I'm
 
01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
certainly you know amable to listening
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
but um at this juncture I just
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
personally wouldn't do it followup Mr
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
chair followup so the followup would be
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
then what can we do to make this bill
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
better because we are not the experts
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
you are in terms of the timeline in
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
terms of your concerns around the
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
timeline not that you can't do the job
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
but that the public interest might be
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
better served if there was greater
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility or if there were some
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
aspects uh of us chopping stuff in half
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
that we're not quite half so I know that
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
what would you recommend I think any
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
timeline by definition is kind of going
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be arbitrary I mean we have a
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
365 day timeline for things and and
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's not because it takes exactly 300
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
65 days um but what I will say is that
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
the original uh incarnation of this bill
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
before amended and I am spacing out on
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
if there were other substantive things
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
in the amendment but the thing I'm
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
focusing on is the timelines when I
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
showed up at the Senate and I said I
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
like it okay uh that was based on the
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
timelines as outlined in the original
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and then the amendment that
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
dropped um before the bill got exec
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
chopped those in half so I would say
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
since like I said all timelines by
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
Nature are arbitrary I would prefer to
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
revert to the ones that were in the
 
01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:33.190 align:start position:0%
revert to the ones that were in the
original

01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill vice chair Thomas has a question
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
my question so this goes back to a
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
comment made by a previous testifier
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
saying that uh having these shorter
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
timelines was um he didn't say critical
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
but in my words would be important and
 
01:03:53.829 --> 01:03:53.839 align:start position:0%
critical to Capital investors as whether
 
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
they spend their money here or take it
 
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere where so where do you
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
see the middle ground here in terms of
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
having something that investors see is
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
not a quagmire so they go somewhere else
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
and yet leaving the public enough time
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
to comment and in addition you know a a
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
tag on that question would be is what
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
the example you use of someone of
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
something coming in at the last minute
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
and therefore public having less time to
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at it where's the where's
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
the safeguards to guarantee against that
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
being used against perhaps a project
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
being done by someone or some entity
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
keep putting in new information at the
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
last minute and you keep extending the
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
timeline so the public has more input
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
all of that I think should be blended
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
into what's the happy medium on this
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely um I'll also draw your
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
attention to a another piece of
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that was that is also probably
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
contrary to my opinion but it's worth um
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
finding in the in for the sake of uh uh
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
compromise here is um I believe it was
 
01:05:01.319 --> 01:05:02.430 align:start position:0%
compromise here is um I believe it was
Senator

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
Waters mentioned the fact that there may
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
be some Ira timelines inflation
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
reduction act timelines that that may
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
theoretically mesh up with things and I
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
think that's something that that we
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
should certainly look at the Timeline
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm familiar with that's not
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily gerine to this specific bill
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
was when the Twin State energy project
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
was still um theoretically a possibility
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
I was waiting through the grant process
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
to apply for some money that would help
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
in um The Blocking and tackling of um
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
helping the SEC come to a decision more
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
rapidly being the idea um so I'm
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
familiar there were timelines attached
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
to that there maybe timelines attached
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
to other things I think it would be
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
prudent for folks to follow up with um
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters as far as the drisking
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
investment component here is
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
um looking at it from a regulatory
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
perspective um and phrasing it like um
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
making the process more clear um I don't
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
personally see the timeline as being a
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
impediment to investment I see
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
uncertainty with what can happen during
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
that timeline as being an impediment to
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
investment um I see if you necessarily
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
correlated a longer timeline with more
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to show up and
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
throw monkey wrenches into the process
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
then then that would be of
 
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
concern um that's not necessarily
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
concern of mine though my concern is um
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
is making sure that the public is
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
engaged fully and thoroughly I've found
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
that in the instances in these type of
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
situations when you short change the
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
public in the name of expediency even if
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
you um doing it you know for altruistic
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
reasons or you know for what you think
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
are good reasons you can create some
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
strategic issues for yourself down the
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
road because when people feel like
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're not heard they tend to get
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
louder not quieter so um I apologize for
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
giving you a roundabout answer there I
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
think it's a valid question um clearly
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not an investor but um the um I
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
think the risk is
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
more um tied to the actual known steps
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
that you have to take and whether or not
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
somebody can move the goalposts on you
 
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
than whether it's 90 days or 45
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
days followup thank you for the followup
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
so uh I agree with you uh in in what you
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
were describing so in other words what
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you say is that under the
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
new criteria for the SEC and their
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility to um evaluate these uh
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
these things that you feel the SEC has
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
the tools now that they can navigate
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
through all those pitfalls that you had
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think we can
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
because the SEC as we sit here today is
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
just myself and I have the ability to
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
cooperate with sister agencies and
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
they've been incredible um in
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
cooperation um doe Dees phenomenal
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
phenomenal uh work that they've done to
 
01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
make my life easier um the issue is as
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
far as my actual resources that I have
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated to my mission is zero people
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's just myself um so if we move me
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
over to the Pu proper I become a Force
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
multiplier for the Pu they can hand me
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
some things that are pertinent to rate
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
cases and other things they have going
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
on but going the other direction I can
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
call upon their staff personnel which
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
could be an analyst or an attorney when
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's a big permitting project coming
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
down the line and um that's a very very
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
good position for me to be in this next
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
year under house bill 609 or this this
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
next you know
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
um I'm just sort of thinking before the
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
next legislative session when we have a
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
year under our belt I think that um you
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
know we based on the projects that I
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate in the queue um now that Twin
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
States is probably not going to happen
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
it'll be a good dry run and a good test
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
for us to see whether the processes and
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
the uh structure outlined in 9 work and
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
I have confident that they will because
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
I've done a handful of things by and
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
large by myself for the past couple
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
years and when you add more resources to
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
the mix especially ones from an agency
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
that already has them I I like where
 
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
that puts me a
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
lot representative Thomas also has a
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I'm going
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
to preface this question by saying that
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
I come from St gobain land um if with
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
this rushed timeline a permit and I
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
don't even know if you're the right
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
person to ask this but if with this
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
rushed permit uh I mean rushed timeline
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
a permit is granted and then we find out
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they were not truthful or
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
there was um uh subjects that were not
 
01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
considered or information was not
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
available what protections does the
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire have for that I
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
honestly do not know the answer to that
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.030 align:start position:0%
question thank you
apologies

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Kennedy
 
01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.870 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Kennedy
has

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um uh like
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas I'm not sure if
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
you're the right person to ask this
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
question but I I had a question about
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing that has bothered several
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
people which is in the the first
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph where it's talking about
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
expansion and it says expansion of such
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
facilities shall be no larger than the
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
existing facility's name plate capacity
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
and shall be located at the existing
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
facility's physical location
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
or a budding parcel so when I'm when I'm
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
listening to people Senator Waters and
 
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
other people I mean it's clear to me
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
that expansion and repowering is not
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
what this is about this is about
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
replacement it's about replacement of a
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
current facility with either wind or
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
solar and you know I mean it's it's a
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
little odd to be talking about name
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
plate capacity since again the output
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
from those sources is random but you
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
could take a look at the peak capacity
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
of a wind farm or whatever
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
but you know given if that is in fact
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this part of the bill um
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know the the the idea that you could
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
replace a coal plant or a gas turbine
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
with a wind farm or a solar farm on the
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
same area I think is you know mistaken I
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
mean those those facilities take a
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
hundred times the land area of a coal
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
plant or a gas turbine so you know if
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
you got a current site I mean I don't
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
know if it has some gigantic area around
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
it that is not being used but you know I
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
can foresee that if if you go down this
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
road you're not going to have the kind
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
of space at that site that you would
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
need so I I don't know how you see what
 
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
this paragraph means or how you would
 
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:12.520 align:start position:0%
Implement that maybe you could comment
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
on that well you know trying to stay um
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know objective here to the different
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
fuel types one of the examples I've
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
given just to um put it in perspective
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
is maramax station is what we'd probably
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
call a small coal plant perhaps a
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
mediumsized coal plant it's about 500
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
megawatts I think it's 490 somewhere in
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
that range and um you can look up online
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
there are different sources I forget
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
which one I used but there's a
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
calculator that you can basically say
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
how would we replace this with with
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
something else you know in terms of Base
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
load capacity or name plate capacity um
 
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
if you were to try to replace maramax
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
station with solar panels under the
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
current technological world live in
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
you'd need 3,000 Acres 3500 Acres just
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
to get the same generation capacity uh
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
forgetting that that's that that would
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
be intermittent power so whether or not
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
you think that's a phenomenal idea or
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
not I just don't think that that's going
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
to happen I don't think anybody is going
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
to attempt to do that I think the far
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
more likely
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
scenario is that due to improved
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
technology or perhaps a legislative
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment to what we call
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
RPS um that you may see things like um
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know Green hydrogen being utilized
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
something else that comes in a truck or
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
a pipe that is um uh carbon neutral that
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
can be utilized in a similar Basel load
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh Power Plant in a similar capacity so
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
um that's not my opinion that's just
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
sort of a hypothetical wind turbines too
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
the installed name plate capacity is
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
like 3 megawatt you get about one
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt so you would need to find a
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
place to put 500 of those in New
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to replace maramax station so
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
I I understand fully the uh the the
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
concern sir I just don't think that
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
that's what would happen
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
followup yeah it's not just the number
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
of the turbines they have to be spaced
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
also because they can't interfere with
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
each other but it sounds like you're
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
aware of that so I mean do you think
 
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
this paragraph needs a
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
rewrite apologies sir which paragraph
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
are we looking
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
at the one that's talking about uh sorry
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh it starts uh line five on the
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
first page on page and the one that's
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
talking about expansion and repowering
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
of current
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
requir I uh something kind of leaped off
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
the theoretical page to me was
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative Corman I believe
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
question um which was an extreme
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but say that you owned an
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
existing generation site and then bought
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
a thousand acres around it does that
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
grandfather in the Thousand Acres for
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
repowering I I don't know the answer to
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
that question um I would say generally
 
01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.590 align:start position:0%
that question um I would say generally
rewrite

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
rewrite
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
um Clarity perhaps um I'm just not as I
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
said my my comments I'm just not fully
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
um understanding of what the word
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
repowering is um to me you know looking
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
at it it sounds pretty straightforward
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
you're taking a power plant you're
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
replacing it with a new power plant or
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're hooking up a natural gas pipeline
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
to maramax station and having it burn
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
LNG instead of coal um but the ambiguity
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's baked in gives me pause not
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't think I could
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
sufficiently navigate it but because
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
whatever system we devise has to be
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
resilient enough for your legislative
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
intent to
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
endure multiple generations of
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent um government officials so um
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
I would leave as little up to
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
imagination as possible that would be my
 
01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.270 align:start position:0%
imagination as possible that would be my
personal

01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
preference okay great representative
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
Kaplan has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for coming in uh this
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
is a little more pragmatic you mentioned
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
your concern about public input in in
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
the process and and the timeline not
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
allowing that um so specifically would a
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
90day period for a public hearing be
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
enough in your opinion rather than a 45
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
day oh I absolutely I I mean I think so
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's a reasonable thing
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
to do and at this point in time again
 
01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
hypothesizing the house bill 609 World
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
um the mechanics of actually scheduling
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
the meeting would be far easier when
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get five people in a
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
room instead of 10 you know so or nine
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
that okay representative McGee has a
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
question yeah thanks um actually in the
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
beginning of your testimony uh Mr Beamer
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
you used the language uh
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
retrofitting or repurposing existing
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
sites and I think that might be more
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
exact language that we're all trying to
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
Grapple with than because repurposing or
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
retrofitting implies that you're going
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
to be transitioning it from one thing to
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
another rather than the repowering which
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
I think people are having difficulty
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
picturing yeah um I think I Ed those
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
words because I wanted to sort of um
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
throw out there that that things that we
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
perceive to be synonyms may not
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily be synonyms and uh
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
repowering is the one with probably the
 
01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
most ambiguity repurposing a site could
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
be tearing down a power plant and making
 
01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
a a dairy farm I mean you know um but um
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
retrofitting I think is probably more
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
clear because my definition of
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
retrofitting would say um hook up
 
01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
natural gas to maramax station turn it
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
into a gas burner
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
retrofit an existing burner to burn
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
something else that' be a retrofit
 
01:17:58.710 --> 01:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
repowering though
 
01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.830 align:start position:0%
repowering though
[Music]

01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the one I'm not so sure
 
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
about representative Ms has a question
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you for
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh coming in I don't know if you heard
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
my question to um representative Waters
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
about um why it was that the bill
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
deletes the ability for a municipality
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.070 align:start position:0%
deletes the ability for a municipality
an

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
in with an affected facility not to have
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
a special a separate public hearing do
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts on that is that
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
something that is uh is uh uh meaningful
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
or does has it gotten in the way in the
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
past of uh approvals um by separate
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing are you referring to the
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that if it's below a certain
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
generation threshold it's a municipal
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
issue and if if it's above a threshold
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
it's a state
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
issue because I know there are
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
components especially with with projects
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
where you know you have you you were
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
required to have an SEC meeting in the
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
county I believe
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
um but if if it's a transmission line
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
that goes through multiple counties now
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're having multiple meetings in
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
towns the the the way the ex and and as
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
I understand that this is in current
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
statute that the way it's currently
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
worded is that um if there is a proposed
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
facility to be located in a specific
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
municipality mhm that municipality has
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to request a separate public
 
01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
meeting just for that municipality
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
separate from the one that that that
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
needs that is required to be held in the
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
county and and this bill eliminates the
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
the ability of a municipality to request
 
01:19:48.629 --> 01:19:48.639 align:start position:0%
that okay um would it be all right if I
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
um get a response to that and follow up
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
with the committee later on because I
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't that
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
perfectly F
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right we need to move along
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one final
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
question yes and this will be quick it's
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh one of the questions I asked Senator
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
Waters which is about the sequencing of
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
the public info sessions and then the
 
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
SEC public hearing do they need to be in
 
01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
SEC public hearing do they need to be in
that

01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
order the info session preceding the
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing yes um are are you saying
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
statutorily or in my opinion
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
both both um in my opinion the
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
information should be afforded to the
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
public before the public hearing so it's
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
hard to comment on something that you
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the information
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
on okay Mr Beamer thank you very much
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your perspective uh being the
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
SEC guy and appreciate you being here
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
today we got to move along though and
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call up Meredith Hatfield
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
next to give us the perspective of The
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
Nature Conservancy
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
we do want to move on to HB
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
540 fairly quickly thank you good
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
morning uh Meredith Hatfield for The
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
Nature Conservancy um we do agree with
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
several of the points raised um by Mr
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
Beamer and clf so I'll try not to repeat
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
them um we do thank uh Senator Waters
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the um co-sponsors for trying to
 
01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire is well
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
positioned to take advantage of Ira
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
funding and we agree that we need more
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um it's our view that um
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
it should be uh non-emitting um if we
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
are going to FASTT track it um one
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
concern that I don't think has been
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
directly raised is um how the timelines
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
might impact the other agencies um so I
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be because Dees does play
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
such an important role in sighting it
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
would be good to hear from Dees if they
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
can meet these timelines and if they
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
might um conflict with other laws or um
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
with Federal permitting
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
requirements uh we agree with respect to
 
01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:05.719 align:start position:0%
whether um the FasTrack should be um
 
01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%
tied to name plate capacity versus
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
interconnection for the reasons that clf
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
um articulated we also agree that um it
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't apply to sites that haven't
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
already been through the SEC
 
01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:19.950 align:start position:0%
already been through the SEC
process

01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
um repowering I believe is potentially a
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
term of Art and there might be um a
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
useful definition at ISO New England or
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
in some other similar regulatory process
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we could look to for that
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
um we weren't clear if it applies to
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
transmission um we don't have a view on
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
whether it does but I think when I first
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
read this I was thinking Generation Um
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
that and we do agree also with um a
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
concern about striking allowing um a
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
municipality or an unincorporated place
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
that might be impacted by a project um
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
to to not allow them to request a public
 
01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
to to not allow them to request a public
information

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
session and then a very technical
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
question on um page one line 12 um I
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
didn't know if that I think I'm confused
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
because that's says 162 H7 but later
 
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
there are references to
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
h7a so I think um perhaps Mr
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
Monahan um knows how to how to answer my
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
question so I can I can ask him um and I
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
think those were uh all of the comments
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we had that were additional thank
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
you those are good catches thank you any
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hatfield seeing none thanks
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
again and please do consult with Mr
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
Monahan about that other question uh Mr
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
Monahan has submitted a pin card he's
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
willing to answer questions if there are
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
any he has no testimony to deliver but
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
is willing to answer questions does
 
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question for Mr
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
monan representative
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
McGee yeah I think we'd like to get the
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
clarity about um I think I have an
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of why on page four line
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
three section
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
1B um the piece for municipalities was
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
removed but perhaps you can answer
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative M's question around why
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
that was taken out uh yes and I guess it
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
gets fundamentally uh the the approach
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill um as many members of the
 
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee know was it last summer or two
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
summers ago uh you met to try to uh
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
figure out a better way to get a to get
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
a better set evaluation committee
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
process uh one of the observations was
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
that uh we had exact we have a one- siiz
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
fits-all so for northern pass that had
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
to go through 31 towns you have the
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
exactly the same process as a a facility
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
that wants to do an expansion or or
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
repowering so this was an approach to
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
change that the theory here is that
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
because we are limiting this fast track
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
to uh existing facilities the community
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
already knows that there's a power plant
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
there uh and that uh it will be sized to
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
to the uh the internet connection or the
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
name plate or whatever might be worked
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
out and so having the uh underlying
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing process that includes you
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
know the applicant having a um a
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
pre-application process then the site
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee undertaking its U
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing and then each of the
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
agencies having their own public process
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
seem to be a
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable um amount of public input
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
because it's an existing facility um and
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
because what we're trying to do is get
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
to an answer to representative Thomas's
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
question the current process require is
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
a 14-month process to get through the
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee process what
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're attempting to do here is to get it
 
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
to about seven months um which gets to
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Andrews concerns about the ability to
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
attract Capital uh drisk projects um
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
things like that so in answer to
 
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
represent Mon's questions the thought is
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the current the community is well
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
aware of it uh it's the
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
applicant uh when they make their
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
application they they would consult the
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
local community for the public hearing
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
process so uh so in an effort to make
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
the process uh swifter there was a
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
consolidation of that um public hearing
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
process representative Ms has a question
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for um for that
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
clarification I I I guess
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
the I don't know if it's really a
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
question but maybe the push back would
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
be that um you know if um if there's a
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
project in Rockham County if there's a
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
project in Hampton for example um I I
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect that every
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
Community every individual town in
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
rockim County should be able to have a
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing um because
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
one one meeting that covers the whole
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
County would certainly be appropriate
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
but I do think that the any that the
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
that the the town that's hosting this
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
facility should have the right the
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
privilege if you will to have a separate
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
meeting in their town to make it as
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
convenient as possible for the people in
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
that town to ask their questions because
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that are the most
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
directly impacted so I'm I'm struggling
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
still still struggling with why the
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
language is taken out I think that's
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
fair and there's probably an easy way to
 
01:27:57.790 --> 01:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
address that without adding time to the
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
system uh and that's because these are
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
existing facilities I don't think you NE
 
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
have to rely on the county which was you
 
01:28:08.109 --> 01:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
know Legacy legislation so perhaps the
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
the that public information session
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
should take place in the community in
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
which the current facility
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
exists but of course any municipality is
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
free to intervene uh at the site
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
valuation committee they often
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
do followup you need a followup okay so
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
I you know but I think that's what we
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
want to try to avoid right having uh
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities intervene in a in a in a
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
legal way I mean that that really slows
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
the process and that's what the public
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
information process is for is so that
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the application being made
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
folks participate in it so I know I
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative V you have out
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
to do I'm happy to participate in it you
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm the uh the architect of this
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
and so I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
work with the committee but honestly I
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
think the goal is to try over the this
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
process is to get to yes on this so we
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
have a system that we can point to those
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
who want to invest in New Hampshire to
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
say we have taken some steps to make it
 
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
quicker uh the goal here uh was not to
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
eliminate uh the uh environmental
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
permitting or the other processes that
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
take place within uh in the process it
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
was a matter of more efficient timelines
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
for existing facilities so okay
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan gets the last
 
01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
Monahan uh just following up with the
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
idea of increasing the 45-day period for
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
a public hearing to a 90day hearing what
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
is your opinion on that and how would
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
that fit into your expedited process the
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
underlying Theory here is that we're
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
trying to have a swifter system for
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that already exists uh and
 
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
that uh it's really incumbent upon the
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
applicant to make that process work so
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
that people feel informed and they're a
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
part of the process and so uh the reason
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
we change we suggesting it change from
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh 90 to 45 days is so that we can have
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
a quicker bureaucratic process uh with
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
while at the same time respecting the uh
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
the role of public import um we're
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that because we are
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
talking about uh modifications or
 
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
changes to facilities that already exist
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
well it looks like we have a lot to
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
discuss in our work session on this bill
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I sincerely hope that you'll be able
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
to be here when we have that work
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
session I haven't scheduled it yet so I
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
can't tell you when it is but y uh
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
unless it's at the same hour as the
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
eclipse um I will be here but uh I'll
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
try not to schedule it for that hour but
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
I but I must say I have everyone who's
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
testified today I have been in touch
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
with we've I've shared draft amendments
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
um I think um uh we will not necessarily
 
01:30:57.310 --> 01:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with you uh continue to
 
01:30:59.950 --> 01:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
work with stakeholders to uh narrow the
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
issues so that when we do get to a work
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
session uh there's some more there's
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
some agreement uh about how to approach
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
all this well now you know what our
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
concerns are so that'll work well great
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you we're going to
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing then on Senate
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 451 and we're going to turn around
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
very quickly and open a public hearing
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 540 and here to introduce
 
01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
the bill to us for on behalf of Senator
 
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
Lang is dy
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
Fett who is the U Senate Aid I believe
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
for Senator Lang so Dy welcome good to
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
see you again and thank you for being
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
here good to see you as well good
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
morning chairman Vose and members of the
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Daley Fett and I'm
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate majority caucus director I'm
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
here to introduce s sp540 on behalf of
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang as amended by the senate
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
senate Bill 540 would require the
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy to investigate ways
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
to facilitate both behind the meter
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
energy storage and utility scale energy
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
storage in New Hampshire the
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
investigation would be divided into two
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
portions the first would be focused on
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
residential behind the meter storage
 
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
with a report due December 30th of 2025
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
and the second focused on utility scale
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
storage with a due date of December 30th
 
01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:12.990 align:start position:0%
storage with a due date of December 30th
of

01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
2026 the Senate amended the bill by
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
adding in the requirement that one the
 
01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
department specifically consider how
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
public policy can best establish
 
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
accurate and efficient price signals for
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
energy storage projects that avoid
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
actual transmission and distribution
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
costs or reduce wholesale electricity
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
market prices and two the best way to
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
encourage both utility and non-utility
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
investments in energy storage
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
projects the amendment also added in the
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
reporting dates uh in December 2025 and
 
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
December 2026 and that the bill will
 
01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
take effect upon passage Senator Lang
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
thanks you for your consideration of s
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
sp540 thank you for allowing me the
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak this morning and if
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I can either
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
bring them to Senator Lang and make sure
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
you all get an answer I also believe the
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy is here who can
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
also answer any questions that you
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
have excellent thank you for introducing
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation any questions from the
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kaplan has a
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr fette for coming in uh I just
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
have a quick quick question it seems to
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
be that this is amending a statute that
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
set up a a report to be issued this year
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
this August I believe so why why the EXT
 
01:33:25.629 --> 01:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
ition it seems to me that this bill
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
basically just extends the report that
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
was already due yeah I actually don't
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question but
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to get back to you after I
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
talk to sen thank you we'll be hearing
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
from the doe in just a minute they may

01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
fette seeing none well thank you thank
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
you very much chair please say hi to
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang for us and next we'll hear
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
from Josh Elliot of the uh Department of
 
01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.550 align:start position:0%
from Josh Elliot of the uh Department of
En

01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning Mr chairman members
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Josh
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
Elliott director of the division of
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
policy and programs with the New
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy um as Mr
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
fet uh summarized the bill quite well um
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
essentially this has the department
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
taking on sort of a dual track
 
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
investigation first of looking at um
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
behind the meter storage and then
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
looking at utility scale storage uh
 
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
through our um investigatory process um
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
with those um dates of having a report
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
due by December 30th 2025 for the
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
initial one and then uh the report for
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
the utility scale storage due by
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
December 30th of 2026 um I have a
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony letter that is coming around
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
realizing that you've heard a lot today
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to stop and take any
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have um
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
about uh the bill before
 
01:34:52.639 --> 01:34:54.990 align:start position:0%
about uh the bill before
you

01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
McGee hi thank you for being here um
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I when I
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
first took a look at the bill I I it I
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
noticed that in the analysis where it
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
says uh the bill requires the department
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
of energy to investigate ways to
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate um I I wondered if facilitate
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh was the right place to stop in terms
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
of modifying what it is that you're
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
doing with the investigation is it to
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
facilitate adoption of or to
 
01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:29.109 align:start position:0%
facilitate adoption of or to
facilitate

01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
um you know the benefit like I just feel
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
like it it stops a little short of
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
defining what you're going to be doing
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
although I think the bill does have some
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
good detail in it um thank you for the
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
question representative um yes so in
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a dual not to use the Dual
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
track uh um phrase again um but
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
essentially how to facilitate those um
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually a through F of what are we
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
looking at here right what are we
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think you we can look at um uh
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
subset on line 11 and 12 how public
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
policy can best establish accurate and
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
effic efficient price signals for energy
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
storage projects um how to best
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
encourage both utility and non-utility
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
investments in storage projects so
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's acknowledgement um not explicit
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
but certainly implicit if you're looking
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
through the duties here of energy
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
storage is a good tool in the toolkit
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
how can we make sure that it is um um
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
operating efficiently within New
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what are those public
 
01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
policy choices um that need to be
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
structured around those to ensure that
 
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
so followup follow up so are we to
 
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
determine that if we pass this bill into
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
legislation that by the end of 2025 in
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
the end of 2026 you will be giving us
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
um actionable information in order for
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
us to move forward with legislation or
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
programs that should be implemented in
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
order to address each of these thank you
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
for the question um yes if if through
 
01:36:56.189 --> 01:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
the purp uh through the course of the
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
investigation there are clear statutory
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
hurdles whether it's you know what have
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
you in terms of in terms of either sting
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
sighting battery storage or um or citing
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
it or um either efficient price signals
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
and things like that that need clear
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
either legislative Direction on I think
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
that would be included as part of those
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
investigations presented to this
 
01:37:18.510 --> 01:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee as well as your colleagues and
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
other committees um for uh um for
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
consideration if the the legislature
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
would want to move forward with such a
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
policy and the last TI I'll have is any
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
of this um actually going to dovetail
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
along with the climate action plan that
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
Dees is working on because I just keep
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
wondering how the connections work in
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
terms of what we're pursuing and why
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um we have
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
been working with our colleagues at um
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services regarding their
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
peap uh uh their climate action plan um
 
01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
there are references to storage in it
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
this Genesis was actually of this bill
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
came prior to that um but I don't see
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
them as working in conflict with one
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
another representative Kaplan has a
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr Elliott um as I asked the
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
previous speaker I'm GNA repeat my
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
question to you it seems like 374 H3
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
came into effect August 2022 and that
 
01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
was uh mandating a report that would
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
have been due in two years what happened
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
to that report and how does that tie
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
into this extension thank you very much
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
for the question representative that's
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
an excellent question um two main
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
factors um the first of which the
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
original study did not allow the
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
department to hire any Consultants or
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
get any any additional help in terms of
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
actually moving this forward um battery
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
storage is not something that the
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
department necessarily has in-house
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
expertise on and we would have to rely
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
on consultants in order to be able to
 
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
help move forward the process both as on
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
the engagement side as well as sort of
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
those the the very technical details
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
that would be um contemplated including
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
engineering standards and things like
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
that um the second um we had a pair of
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
bills pass which you're I'm sure you're
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
all familiar with with the bipar
 
01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law and the inflation
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
reduction act so a lot of Staff time has
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
been devoted to working through those
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
applications working through all the
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
thought process um behind standing up
 
01:39:16.109 --> 01:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
all those the multitude of programs that
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
are included as part of that um Senator
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
Waters um uh is a particular proponent
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
of battery storage we worked with him in
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate to make sure that we could
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
sort of refresh this process get it
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
moving forward again and give the
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
department the the resources to be able
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
investigation representative muns has a
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
for coming back to our committee um I I
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
had some questions about language that
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
um was changed or deleted from the
 
01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
existing statute by this bill um the
 
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
first question was um
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
the the bill you know uses a term
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
utility scale energy storage as opposed
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to front- ofth meter
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
storage which is in current statue
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
what's the difference um that thank you
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
for the question that is a good question
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh regarding um they could be really
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
interchangeable um utility scale storage
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I think provides a little bit of a
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
better definition of what exactly are we
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
talking about these would be Merchant
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
projects um similar to uh a generation
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
station uh in terms of scale um and
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
would be participating in the market
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
that way they' be participating as part
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
of bidding into the ice New England um
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
process for capacity um whereas um front
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the meter sort of a little is a
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
little bit more vague but um I it just
 
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
provided a little bit more definition to
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
what exactly we're talking about and
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
followup followup and in in existing
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
statute it it talks about um that the
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
department shall investigate
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh for both utility and non-utility
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
owned energy storage projects does this
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill limit it to just utility owned um
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
it does not um the the second the second
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
study if you will the second
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
investigation um references utility
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
scale um I'm just double checking to
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
make sure um actually is contemplated
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
actually in line one of page two to
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
encourage both utility and private
 
01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:22.229 align:start position:0%
encourage both utility and private
sector

01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
Investments

01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
bernardy has
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman so the uh the
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal note as well as the last part of
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
the bill uh references assessing
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities for the
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
cost of doing these studies so
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
um can
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
you uh I guess
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
explained how you came up with that that
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
costing and
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
why these costs should
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
be uh levied on the distribution
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
utilities thank you for the question
 
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh so the cost estimate
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
was done based on similar investigations
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously no investigation isn't
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
identical based on the uh contents that
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
it seeks to examine um but we've got a
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
pretty good uh idea of roughly how much
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
these investigations cost um the figure
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
that's quoted in the fiscal not is
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit on the higher end
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
but we'd rather come in with the higher
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
end so you know exactly the committee
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
can and as well as your colleagues in in
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
house finance know exactly what the cost
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
um could potentially
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
be regarding the second question in
 
01:42:36.189 --> 01:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
terms of the the funding mechanism um if
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
the uh traditionally that is how it is
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
how um investigations are funded through
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
assessments on the assessed uh excuse me
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
on the regulated Utilities in this case
 
01:42:47.589 --> 01:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
it would be um similar to any
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
investigations that we do where there's
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
a direct Nexus to the distribution grid
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
um which is why the electric utilities
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
would be assessed for
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
this follow up follow up so someone
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
doing battery storage is not
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily A is not necessarily utility
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
they're an independent could be an
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
independent entity how is that just
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
Justified that um thank you for the
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
question yes it would be justified in
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
the the fact that these would be
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
connecting to the distribution utility
 
01:43:17.589 --> 01:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
would be just excuse me would be
 
01:43:20.189 --> 01:43:20.199 align:start position:0%
connecting to the distribution system of
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
these utilities and then in theory um
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
potentially reducing costs provided that
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
they're cited correctly there's the
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
correct Market mechanisms um to cost for
 
01:43:31.709 --> 01:43:31.719 align:start position:0%
those electric distribution to utilities
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's um reduction in future
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
upgrades needed or capacity or things
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
like that um but we' I'd be happy to
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
take back to legal council to have
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
another take a look at that and whether
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's a more appropriate funding
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
mechanism representative liwicki has a
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um one of my
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
questions having been more you closely
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
related to the business is do these
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
batteries actually exist how many
 
01:43:59.950 --> 01:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours how many megawatt hours
 
01:44:02.589 --> 01:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
of battery can be had be and how does
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
that compare with for instance uh the
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
marac station or you know some of our
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
existing generating facilities um thank
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question so for on
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
the the residential side uh Liberty
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
Utilities actually has a pilot project
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
where they have installed these in uh
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
residential um uh homes within their
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
service territory uh they are moving to
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
phase two of that invest uh excuse me
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
phase two of that pilot fortunately
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
phase two has then been wrapped in
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
wrapped up within their rate case um
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
which the department has filed
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
objections to um and was requested to be
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
dismissed um for a variety of reasons
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
completely unrelated to battery storage
 
01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
but that is sort of where it sits in
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
from a regulatory standpoint within the
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
state um they are available on the on
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
the commercial Market I'm aware that
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
Tesla has power walls I'm sure there are
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
other companies that provide similar
 
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
services in which place um you
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
essentially have them as backup with in
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
residential homes uh regarding utility
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
scale the um US Department of energy has
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
provided funding um to a um one
 
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
particular facility in West Virginia um
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
it's a private firm um where they are
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
working on utility scale long duration
 
01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:13.719 align:start position:0%
um battery storage um using iron rather
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
than lithium or other sort of um uh more
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to find um components um I am
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
not familiar and well versed in the C of
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
how it works um but my understanding is
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
essentially it's the rusting and
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
unresting of the of the iron um which is
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
how the the energy is
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
stored follow
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
up the question is do the batteries
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
exist how do they compare with existing
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
generating facilities thank you for the
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
clarification um yes they do exist
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
they're in their infancy um it would
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
depend on a variety of factors as to how
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
scalable those are so I can I'd be happy
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
to look up and do some additional
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
research and get you an answer as to
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that offer
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Elliott
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh so you said that the do that Doe D
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
currently does not have expertise in
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
batteries are there plans to add that
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
expertise given that we believe that
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
batteries are going to become more and
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
more important in terms of reliability
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
and especially um making sure that
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
renewal able energy is also going to uh
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to dispatchable energy thank
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative um
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes so by doing these investigations
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
right the department also gains that
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that expertise as part of
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
that process of where we can have folks
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
in house who learn more about these
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
through going through these processes
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that answers the
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
question representative muns has a
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh Mr chair thank you
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
for indulging me again um in in the bill
 
01:46:58.510 --> 01:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
on page one lines 18 and
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
19 it it talks it it says reviews review
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
programs and regulatory requirements and
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
Juris other jurisdictions to identify
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
best practices for a potential
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
program and I'm not it's not clear what
 
01:47:15.149 --> 01:47:15.159 align:start position:0%
that program
 
01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
is um I I looked at the existing statute
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
and the existing statute talks about a
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
bring your own home bring your own
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
device program is that what you have in
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
mind here or what does that mean um
 
01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative that might have just been
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
a uh uh as we were putting together the
 
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
bill with Senator Lang that may have
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
been a key phrase that inadvertently got
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
dropped um I'm happy to go back and take
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
a look at the statute um that you cited
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
there and look um to make sure that um
 
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
if that was dropped um that we reinsert
 
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.189 align:start position:0%
if that was dropped um that we reinsert
it

01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
followup followup if it is if it is that
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
which I suspect it probably is what is a
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
bring your own device program sure thank
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh bring your own
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
device uh essentially is where rather
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
than having a utility pay for your
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
battery storage within your home
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
essentially you have you pay out out of
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
pocket of yourself and go and and
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
install a battery device in your own
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
home thank
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
you okay any further questions for Mr
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
Elliot and the
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
doe seeing none I want to thank you for
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
being here we'll look forward to the
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
additional information you can supply to
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
help us decide what to do with this
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
legislation of course thank you I have
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
no more pink cards on this bill is there
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else who would like to say
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
it seeing none we're going to close the
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill a Senate
 
01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:43.149 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill a Senate
Bill

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
540 and we're going to enter a lunch
 
01:48:50.589 --> 01:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
recess we will resume our activity today
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
at 1 p.m. with a full work session on
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
the three bills that we heard last week
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%

03:12:17.550 --> 03:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
and cities um permits rebates for some
 
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
older residential solar projects because
 
03:12:23.550 --> 03:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
when the date was originally fixed but
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
if if they uh are doing some
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
redesigning focuses rebates largely for
 
03:12:31.950 --> 03:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
the new projects and the battery storage
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
business was all
 
03:12:36.190 --> 03:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
removed uh the goal is no alternative
 
03:12:38.590 --> 03:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
compliance payments impacted by laws of
 
03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:39.469 align:start position:0%
compliance payments impacted by laws of
other

03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
states um and
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
um that's that's essentially what he
 
03:12:47.790 --> 03:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
said in this
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
testimony okay good thank you
 
03:12:51.510 --> 03:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for refreshing
 
03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
our memory about what this bill is
 
03:12:58.590 --> 03:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
about so it also changes the date of the
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
issuance of the annual report by the
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
department yeah from October 1st to
 
03:13:05.439 --> 03:13:07.229 align:start position:0%
department yeah from October 1st to
November

03:13:07.229 --> 03:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
November
 
03:13:10.469 --> 03:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
1st beginning in 2024
 
03:13:12.110 --> 03:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
right representative McGee I was just
 
03:13:16.630 --> 03:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
going to say um I think the bolded
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
language in my understanding the first
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
section of the Bolder language on uh the
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
first page line starting at line 16
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
basically says
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
that um they may modify existing
 
03:13:30.750 --> 03:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
programs or opportunities funding
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
allocations shall be subject to the
 
03:13:33.630 --> 03:13:33.640 align:start position:0%
apportionment requirements under
 
03:13:36.750 --> 03:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph X which is where they discuss
 
03:13:38.670 --> 03:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
the apportionment of the funds that need
 
03:13:42.349 --> 03:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
to be used um for low and middle income
 
03:13:44.790 --> 03:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
projects as opposed to everything else
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then Part B under there that's also
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
bolded is the part that includes
 
03:13:53.349 --> 03:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or municipalities that have
 
03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
projects that are backed up in the
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
system waiting for um for funding in
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
order to go forward and in that section
 
03:14:06.190 --> 03:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
says it is excluded from um from those
 
03:14:07.469 --> 03:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
requirements the apportionment
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
requirements so those were the two
 
03:14:11.229 --> 03:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
things that I thought the bill mainly
 
03:14:13.710 --> 03:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
was trying to accomplish was to let us
 
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
use the money for those Municipal
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
projects that seem to be pending
 
03:14:19.309 --> 03:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
that could really use some grants from
 
03:14:22.269 --> 03:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.710 --> 03:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
work yes I think you're
 
03:14:29.349 --> 03:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
correct does anybody think uh this is
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
acceptable as is or do you think it
 
03:14:36.990 --> 03:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.070 --> 03:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
changed representative Thomas thank you
 
03:14:43.229 --> 03:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um one of my questions on the
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill hearing was how what was
 
03:14:48.269 --> 03:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
the plan to enfor inform towns and
 
03:14:51.150 --> 03:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
communities about this program change
 
03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not sure I had heard a good
 
03:14:56.150 --> 03:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
answer to that but I'm not sure that it
 
03:14:58.750 --> 03:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
would hold up this bill either but
 
03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:05.710 --> 03:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
mine I think that's a pretty common
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:12.750 --> 03:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
03:15:15.630 --> 03:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
Ms um one of
 
03:15:18.349 --> 03:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
the things I was struggling with a
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
little little bit um in in um on line 14
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
where we talk about how um money to
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
individual projects is going to be
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
allocated um there's um a desire to
 
03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that those are um directed to
 
03:15:40.349 --> 03:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
individuals that meet the uh low to
 
03:15:42.590 --> 03:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
moderate income standards which I think
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
is great um the new language relating to
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivision specifically says
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't apply which I I
 
03:15:56.269 --> 03:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
understand um but I'm I'm wondering if
 
03:15:58.110 --> 03:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
there couldn't be some language added
 
03:15:58.120 --> 03:15:59.110 align:start position:0%
there couldn't be some language added
that

03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:01.590 --> 03:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
says that if it's a case of two
 
03:16:03.469 --> 03:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
different communities competing for the
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
same amount of money if there's enough
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
money for everybody great but if there's
 
03:16:10.349 --> 03:16:10.359 align:start position:0%
only a limited amount of money and
 
03:16:12.910 --> 03:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
there's two different communities say
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth versus Berlin competing for a
 
03:16:19.150 --> 03:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money does the low in
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
would the lowincome lower income
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
Community get the benefit of the doubt
 
03:16:28.269 --> 03:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.469 --> 03:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
first where would you suggest inserting
 
03:16:35.830 --> 03:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
that um you can probably amend that
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
Clause B to to to instead of saying it
 
03:16:46.189 --> 03:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to the
 
03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
apportionment re requirements add some
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
language kind of along the lines of what
 
03:16:54.110 --> 03:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
I just said and the idea is is is that
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's only in a situation where
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's uh two different communities
 
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
competing for you know the available
 
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
money and I I can draft some language if
 
03:17:06.510 --> 03:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
there's some interest in that so are you
 
03:17:09.469 --> 03:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
talking about page one or page two page
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:25.229 align:start position:0%
 
24

03:17:25.229 --> 03:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other suggestions for
 
03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other suggestions for
potential

03:17:32.750 --> 03:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
modifications before before we go any
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
further let me just say that what we're
 
03:17:39.070 --> 03:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
doing here today is we're kind of just
 
03:17:42.030 --> 03:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
brainstorming we're not going to go out
 
03:17:46.269 --> 03:17:46.279 align:start position:0%
and write any amendments today what I'm
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
trying to do is is to
 
03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
identify what might need to be amended
 
03:17:53.950 --> 03:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
and how it might be done so that we can
 
03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
put together a concrete proposal for
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
creating an amendment at some future
 
03:18:03.150 --> 03:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
date so I like your idea representative
 
03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
mons that we
 
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
consider prioritizing who gets the
 
03:18:13.389 --> 03:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
money but um we don't have to write the
 
03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
language right now but we should
 
03:18:17.309 --> 03:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
identify where is the best place in the
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
bill to put
 
03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
it representative liwi uh thank you Mr
 
03:18:24.590 --> 03:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
chairman what I'm thinking I and I keep
 
03:18:26.070 --> 03:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
thinking I don't know whether there's an
 
03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to do it within the bill
 
03:18:30.150 --> 03:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
but to look at cost benefit if we're for
 
03:18:33.189 --> 03:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
instance you know it's we're looking at
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
spending money or giving money away and
 
03:18:39.309 --> 03:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
um we don't know how much what the
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
return may be and for instance if we
 
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
spend a million dollars getting one
 
03:18:45.229 --> 03:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour of battery storage this is
 
03:18:48.030 --> 03:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
not a good deal uh
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
so but and I as I say I don't know how
 
03:18:51.910 --> 03:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
to put it into the bill or whether it
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
would even belong in this bill but I
 
03:18:54.910 --> 03:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
keep thinking that about many of the
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:06.510 --> 03:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
through okay representative
 
03:19:08.910 --> 03:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
partiall thank you chair um I don't
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
think this uh Bill actually deals with
 
03:19:13.630 --> 03:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
battery except for in the analysis and
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
the methodology it's the only place
 
03:19:17.110 --> 03:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
where batteries are actually mentioned
 
03:19:19.870 --> 03:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
and Joshua um I'm sorry Joshua Elliot
 
03:19:22.110 --> 03:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
the doe suggested striking all the
 
03:19:23.429 --> 03:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
language that's concerned about
 
03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
batteries I I can appreciate your
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
concern about cost benefit analysis I
 
03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
really do but I just don't think we need
 
03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about batteries with this
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
particular Bill okay yeah and I was just
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
using that as a for instance um you know
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
it could apply to almost anything that
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh we're doing is that there should be
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
some relation between cost and
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
benefit and last let to follow up on
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
that because I I think we're in
 
03:19:49.150 --> 03:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
agreement but uh is it possible if we
 
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
are going to amend this to this uh take
 
03:19:55.070 --> 03:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
Joshua Elliot's advice and strike out
 
03:19:57.550 --> 03:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
all references to batteries in the
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill they're not in the bill well
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
they're in the analysis and the
 
03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:11.229 --> 03:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure how important the
 
03:20:14.590 --> 03:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
analysis portion is but yeah we should
 
03:20:23.150 --> 03:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes could you turn your mic on and
 
03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
repeat that sorry about that yeah if we
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
just uh take under the analysis if we
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
take everything after this bill and put
 
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
a line through it up until the comma
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
then it would just say this bill deletes
 
03:20:38.070 --> 03:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
the required renewable generation
 
03:20:40.030 --> 03:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
incentives program and authorizes a
 
03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
political subdivision incentive rebate
 
03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
or grant program using the fund so that
 
03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
would that would be clear yeah okay
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good change
 
03:20:54.550 --> 03:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
03:20:58.110 --> 03:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
um I question the wording on lines 21
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and 22 on page one where it says
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions I just haven't
 
03:21:05.950 --> 03:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
seen that before should it be Municipal
 
03:21:08.229 --> 03:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal no
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
okay it is correct that is a correct
 
03:21:13.389 --> 03:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
thank you y for legislative language
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
maybe not for everyday language but
 
03:21:17.399 --> 03:21:19.030 align:start position:0%
maybe not for everyday language but
representative

03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:21:21.630 --> 03:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
Ms there was one other thing I was I was
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit concerned about with the
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
bill um and um on page two lines 21 and
 
03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
22 repeals um several sections from
 
03:21:40.750 --> 03:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
current statute and um those relate to
 
03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
um solar programs I believe solar um
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
incentive programs and we heard some
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that um that
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
um that there was um those programs were
 
03:21:58.469 --> 03:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
not working therefore we should
 
03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
eliminate it but there was a commitment
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
to develop um you know a replacement
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
program and it concerns me a little bit
 
03:22:09.790 --> 03:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
about eliminating something without
 
03:22:12.910 --> 03:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
having a replacement available and I you
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
know wonder why we can't if the
 
03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
program's not working why we can't
 
03:22:18.910 --> 03:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh either leave it as it is until we
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
know what the language is or put the new
 
03:22:20.399 --> 03:22:23.229 align:start position:0%
know what the language is or put the new
language

03:22:23.229 --> 03:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
in Mr Elliot would you be willing to try
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
to see if you could shed some light on
 
03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
to see if you could shed some light on
that

03:22:33.990 --> 03:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
03:22:39.429 --> 03:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Mr chairman uh again
 
03:22:40.870 --> 03:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott director of the division of
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
policy and programs with the Department
 
03:22:44.429 --> 03:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
of energy um representative Ms thank you
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
for the question um regarding um the the
 
03:22:51.229 --> 03:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
philosophy sort of behind it we wouldn't
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to if if kept in place until a
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
replacement is devised there's no
 
03:23:00.590 --> 03:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
um we would be spending money that on a
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
program that we know to be ineffective
 
03:23:04.469 --> 03:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we can't zero out that
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
program we can't eliminate it without
 
03:23:06.120 --> 03:23:06.990 align:start position:0%
program we can't eliminate it without
clear

03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
clear
 
03:23:09.150 --> 03:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
statutory um the repeals of these
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
statutes otherwise it directs us to
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
operate this program so we'd be spending
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
money on a program we know doesn't
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
work Mr
 
03:23:20.670 --> 03:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
chair yes go ahead uh representative So
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
you you're you're saying that the
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
program is ineffective on what basis I
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
mean have we seen any reports on that
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
ineffective in that sense that uh the
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
rebate offered amount is currently
 
03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
$1,000 where there is the general belief
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
and thought uh that a a $11,000 rebate
 
03:23:42.269 --> 03:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
is not going to make the difference
 
03:23:44.110 --> 03:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody installs a solar
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
panel in large part I'm sure there are
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
probably individual cases where that may
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
make a sense but um we end up seeing
 
03:23:52.110 --> 03:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
that it just subsidized Solar
 
03:23:53.790 --> 03:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
Development that otherwise would have
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
happened absent this um not truly
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
incentive new Solar
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
Development and these payments are from
 
03:24:04.990 --> 03:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund itself that is
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is correct okay I'm
 
03:24:13.229 --> 03:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the language of U RSA 362 F10
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
right at the
 
03:24:15.359 --> 03:24:17.790 align:start position:0%
right at the
moment

03:24:17.790 --> 03:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
moment
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
did you have a hand up representative
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
Kaplan go ahead yeah thank you Mr chair
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
this is in reference to representative
 
03:24:26.550 --> 03:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
leki's desire to have cost benefit
 
03:24:28.950 --> 03:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
analysis built into this and I I
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that that that's a good
 
03:24:33.309 --> 03:24:33.319 align:start position:0%
idea in practice but this is part of a
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
program the Rex program that already has
 
03:24:37.710 --> 03:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
been determined to be of you know
 
03:24:41.550 --> 03:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
benefit uh to the state uh so I'm not
 
03:24:44.189 --> 03:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
sure how that would work and I'm not
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
given that those kind of analyses are
 
03:24:51.510 --> 03:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
driven by all kinds of factors that take
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
many many years to work out and
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceedings that whether or
 
03:24:57.590 --> 03:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
not we could actually arrive at a a
 
03:24:59.389 --> 03:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
workable definition of a cost benefit
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
analysis for these programs and given
 
03:25:04.189 --> 03:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
that the program the larger program that
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's a part of has already been
 
03:25:08.189 --> 03:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
determined to be of benefit to the state
 
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh it might be problematic that's just
 
03:25:13.150 --> 03:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:13.160 --> 03:25:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
thought

03:25:15.070 --> 03:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:25:18.389 --> 03:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay well we have
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
um well I see he's already left I was
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
going to say while we had Josh up the
 
03:25:24.990 --> 03:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
table we could ask him more questions
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
but he was hiding behind oh
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
okay do you have any uh further
 
03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.670 --> 03:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
Josh representative McGee so to kind of
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
tie it up in a bow um so the way I look
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
at it is it safe to say that the effort
 
03:25:50.229 --> 03:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to take the renewable
 
03:25:53.469 --> 03:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
energy fund and focus it towards what we
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
know is an existing
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
need um so that we can address that
 
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
backlog as as um Mr Evans Brown has said
 
03:26:03.550 --> 03:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
in his testimony of people that are have
 
03:26:05.349 --> 03:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
projects kind of
 
03:26:07.830 --> 03:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
pending thank you for the question um
 
03:26:10.030 --> 03:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of twofold in the one
 
03:26:11.790 --> 03:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
sense that a lot of these programs have
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
been around for a while and of course
 
03:26:15.790 --> 03:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
markets Chang they're different the math
 
03:26:17.469 --> 03:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
works different projects pencil out that
 
03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
may not have before or projects that did
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
no longer do for a variety of reasons um
 
03:26:25.389 --> 03:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
unrelated to this um but which is what
 
03:26:26.830 --> 03:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
we started our initial stakeholder
 
03:26:28.189 --> 03:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
process of saying okay well what's
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
working what's not working you know I
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
can make certain assumptions but I
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
without talking to the folks out in the
 
03:26:33.790 --> 03:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
field I don't know what's working what's
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
not working um so the goal of this is
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
really to refresh and reform the RF to
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's responding to the
 
03:26:41.070 --> 03:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
needs of the market and the people of
 
03:26:43.229 --> 03:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire um in such a
 
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
way that is offering help to where they
 
03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
need help rather than
 
03:26:49.950 --> 03:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe where they needed help 10 years
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
ago yes followup so then the followup
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
would be in relation to representative
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
mun's question um if we were to take
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
Section B um on page one uh which starts
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
at line 19 to 24 if we were to um
 
03:27:10.990 --> 03:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
basically say that for political
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision projects um that we would
 
03:27:16.710 --> 03:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
they would not be subject to a pment
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
requirements under paragraph 10 but that
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
maybe there should be some kind of
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
deference given to is it do you see any
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
benefit or do you see it being a
 
03:27:29.710 --> 03:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
hindrance for us to try and uh ask that
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
the monies be allocated to projects in
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
communities that uh are not all high
 
03:27:38.429 --> 03:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
high income
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
communities thank you for the question
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
it is one that I think a lot of state
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
agencies are dealing with as as going
 
03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
through the Biden uh the Biden admin
 
03:27:49.630 --> 03:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
ministrations justice 40 initiative um
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a question really of of looking
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
at where we're putting our resources
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
right and it sort of gets to the Crux of
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the the underpinning of the RF of we
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're incentivizing
 
03:28:01.389 --> 03:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
projects that would not have otherwise
 
03:28:04.870 --> 03:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
happened um I think it's it's a policy
 
03:28:07.830 --> 03:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
decision I can say that our um we are
 
03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
developing the process of developing a
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
um through an eecbg formula grant or
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency conservation block
 
03:28:16.990 --> 03:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
grant a municipal solar program that is
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
designed to essentially be the guinea
 
03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
pig if you will for something future
 
03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
here and in the the scoring waiting um
 
03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
within that program um does have it
 
03:28:27.150 --> 03:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
tilted towards uh what would be
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
considered lower income communities the
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
the um the Crux is really how you define
 
03:28:34.990 --> 03:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
lower income right what would you what
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
metric should we use as state agency so
 
03:28:38.189 --> 03:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
if I'm implementing that and you were to
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
put in or the committee were to put in
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
language to that effect I think clear
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
definition of what you would consider
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
low income or what metric you wouldd
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
like to use because I could easily see
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
two different communities saying well
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
based on this metric I'm the lower
 
03:28:52.189 --> 03:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
income no on this metric I'm the lower
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
income right so there would need to be
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
some sort of common definition of what
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
you would consider a lower income
 
03:28:58.790 --> 03:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
Community which I think would be very
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
helpful and also if we used your
 
03:29:02.870 --> 03:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
language of trying to incent programs
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't otherwise happen you would
 
03:29:06.510 --> 03:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
have difficulty meeting that barrier as
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
well right yes yeah yes thank you so is
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
the language on page two starting at
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
line 10 that talks about 80% of the area
 
03:29:19.990 --> 03:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
immediate income calculated by the
 
03:29:21.790 --> 03:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
03:29:23.910 --> 03:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
Development is that the kind of metric
 
03:29:26.070 --> 03:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
that would work in this
 
03:29:29.469 --> 03:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
situation um I I think a metric that
 
03:29:30.910 --> 03:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
could work we there's so there's a
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
variety of metrics out there depending
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
on what you're looking at what factors
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
you want to wait um one common one that
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
is used um is free and reduced lunch
 
03:29:42.710 --> 03:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
enrollments because that's a pretty good
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
proxy of where a community might be um
 
03:29:47.469 --> 03:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
say again oh I'm sorry um free and
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch enrollments um as a
 
03:29:51.670 --> 03:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
proportion you could say okay if you're
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
over this number or below the state
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
average or you're above the state
 
03:29:56.670 --> 03:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
average um that is just one there are
 
03:29:58.349 --> 03:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
some issues with that data set just
 
03:30:00.510 --> 03:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
because of the lingering effects of the
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic of where there weren't um uh it
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
was automatic versus having to actually
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
enroll the students in those programs
 
03:30:07.950 --> 03:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
which caused a whole host of other
 
03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
issues but um the so some of those
 
03:30:12.790 --> 03:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
numbers I would have to check with our
 
03:30:14.189 --> 03:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues at the New Hampshire
 
03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to see where the
 
03:30:18.269 --> 03:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
timing in that is um I'd be happy to get
 
03:30:19.590 --> 03:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
back to the committee with a a good
 
03:30:20.910 --> 03:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
metric that we thought would be the
 
03:30:22.990 --> 03:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
right one to use um but I would I
 
03:30:24.150 --> 03:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to say something off the
 
03:30:25.870 --> 03:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
cuff then find out later that from
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
somebody who knows more than I do about
 
03:30:29.590 --> 03:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
the metric oh there's this tremendous
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
thing that there's this flaw underlying
 
03:30:32.110 --> 03:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
that and you don't want to use that
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
because of and I I just don't know at
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
the moment off the top of my head yes I
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that would be useful if you could
 
03:30:39.790 --> 03:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
make a couple of suggestions along those
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
lines representative Corman thank you
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm looking at uh page one line 20
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it says develop incentive or rebate
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
programs or competitive grant
 
03:30:53.309 --> 03:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities so it seems to me there
 
03:30:54.349 --> 03:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
are three different things here
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
incentive programs rebate programs and
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
competitive grant opportunities and when
 
03:31:04.510 --> 03:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
we talk about uh deciding which uh which
 
03:31:07.189 --> 03:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
Community would get a grant based on on
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
income I mean it seems like that would
 
03:31:10.670 --> 03:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
be for the competitive grant
 
03:31:12.790 --> 03:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities and for the incentive and
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
rebate programs those can actually be
 
03:31:18.110 --> 03:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
tailored in various ways and could
 
03:31:19.590 --> 03:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
actually be tailored so that they're
 
03:31:21.790 --> 03:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
directed to lower income communities am
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
I correct in thinking that thank you for
 
03:31:25.710 --> 03:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
the question um yes they could so that
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
language is actually a carbon copy of
 
03:31:30.510 --> 03:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
what is above um on where you see right
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
actually on line 15 um so just to ensure
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
consistency throughout the statute we
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
use that language again um I think
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the department obviously
 
03:31:39.630 --> 03:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
we would want to get some stakeholder
 
03:31:42.309 --> 03:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
input on that but our thinking is that
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
our initial thinking would be that it
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be a competitive grant program
 
03:31:47.590 --> 03:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
would the easiest way they can provide a
 
03:31:49.189 --> 03:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
whole application of what they're doing
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
we can um target funds that way um as
 
03:31:53.189 --> 03:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it's easier right if you
 
03:31:54.670 --> 03:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
have competitive grant program you're
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
evaluating all of them at once versus if
 
03:31:58.189 --> 03:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's a rebate program you're getting
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
them in as they come in you can't say
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
well I if I known this one was coming in
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:05.040 --> 03:32:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
okay any other thoughts about this
 
03:32:13.870 --> 03:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
bill sounds like we have a couple of
 
03:32:16.110 --> 03:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities here to potentially make
 
03:32:16.120 --> 03:32:18.830 align:start position:0%
opportunities here to potentially make
it

03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
better all right seeing no more hands up
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
I think we'll move on and go to Center
 
03:32:29.710 --> 03:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 388 relative to administration of
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:33.479 --> 03:32:35.229 align:start position:0%
 
energy

03:32:35.229 --> 03:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:32:38.429 --> 03:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
and in order to avoid the mistake I made
 
03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
on the first bill I'll ask the clerk to
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
refresh our memory about what this bill
 
03:32:43.439 --> 03:32:44.830 align:start position:0%
refresh our memory about what this bill
is

03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:51.269 align:start position:0%
is
about

03:32:51.269 --> 03:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:53.070 --> 03:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
I think this one is more of a cleanup
 
03:33:00.189 --> 03:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:03.309 --> 03:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
Boe a bill requested by Doe and there
 
03:33:06.269 --> 03:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
will be an amendment um it's a technical
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
cleanup Bill uh home owners being
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
households uh therefore renters can
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
qualify fix the report date section six
 
03:33:20.309 --> 03:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
fixes exemption procedures for
 
03:33:23.910 --> 03:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
assessment of expenses remove straggler
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
Wireless tasks um
 
03:33:31.790 --> 03:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh to be supplied will address
 
03:33:35.229 --> 03:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
new solar owner only ensure projects are
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
ready to move forward and adds by rule
 
03:33:41.229 --> 03:33:41.239 align:start position:0%
or order in a couple of
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
clear as
 
03:33:53.469 --> 03:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
mud no I remembered I was looking I'm
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
pretty sure Josh am I correct that you
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
sent us some suggested Amendment T
 
03:34:02.349 --> 03:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
language for this I was trying to find
 
03:34:04.990 --> 03:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
it uh yes thank you Mr chairman um I did
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
send a long suggested language um that
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
would accomplish the uh items that uh
 
03:34:11.469 --> 03:34:11.479 align:start position:0%
the clerk had mentioned in his
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
recounting of this
 
03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
bill was it a attached to your testimony
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
or yes so it is in it is in the
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
testimony letter um I also sent a a Word
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
document um to folks um so it's actually
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at the testimony
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:34.990 --> 03:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
page yes I I found it and uh I know that
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.389 --> 03:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere everyone everyone should have
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
a copy of this is that correct
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes everyone got one whether they still
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.870 --> 03:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
true all right so I found
 
03:35:01.830 --> 03:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
the the first suggested amendment is on
 
03:35:10.150 --> 03:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:13.150 --> 03:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
16 to
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
change the department of energy by rule
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
or order shall develop a process by
 
03:35:20.910 --> 03:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
which Community solar developers can
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
apply for a for designation as Community
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
solar projects project as a community
 
03:35:31.830 --> 03:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
solar project for new solar arrays
 
03:35:34.870 --> 03:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's the new language that would be
 
03:35:37.950 --> 03:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
added 15 and
 
03:35:37.960 --> 03:35:40.349 align:start position:0%
added 15 and
16

03:35:40.349 --> 03:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
16
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
Mr yes the department of energy
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
um do rules as well as
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
orders currently they do they do a lot
 
03:35:53.469 --> 03:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
of Ru making
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually we gave them as you'll recall
 
03:35:58.670 --> 03:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
when we created the department of energy
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
we gave them five years to move all of
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
the Pu rules that are now doe rules
 
03:36:07.389 --> 03:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
because they thought it would take that
 
03:36:09.950 --> 03:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
long to to do all that Ru
 
03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
making how's that going by the way um I
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
we'll probably hear a lot more about it
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the next bill um but yes it's under
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
underway now um we're working through
 
03:36:21.469 --> 03:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
water and sewer rules at the moment um
 
03:36:24.550 --> 03:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
and then we had a public hearing um I
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
escape it escapes me as to which rule
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
set is going currently under uh is going
 
03:36:29.790 --> 03:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
to have public comment either just did
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
or will in the near future um the rule
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
Set uh doesn't impact my division so I
 
03:36:36.670 --> 03:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you off the top of my head
 
03:36:38.389 --> 03:36:38.399 align:start position:0%
what but it's on our website if you're
 
03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
if folks are
 
03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
curious excellent so the next suggested
 
03:36:42.560 --> 03:36:44.510 align:start position:0%
curious excellent so the next suggested
amendment

03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
is excuse me uh representative Corman
 
03:36:51.309 --> 03:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um so because I'm relatively
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
new I actually don't know the difference
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
between Rule and Order can that be
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
explained to me please certainly Josh
 
03:37:01.950 --> 03:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
sure I will I will give it a shot so the
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to do the ru one
 
03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
because that's a little bit more
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward so under RSA 4 uh 5
 
03:37:12.670 --> 03:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
541a um the each state agency in uh
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
state government is given rle making
 
03:37:16.030 --> 03:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
Authority sometimes it's more explicit
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the legislature saying You
 
03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
must develop rules um I like to think of
 
03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
it this way sort of legislation spells
 
03:37:24.229 --> 03:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
out the framework and then rules fills
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
in all the little gaps in between so
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's literally everything from what form
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
is used to the font size to how
 
03:37:33.630 --> 03:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
something is done you may say um
 
03:37:34.870 --> 03:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually probably using the previous
 
03:37:37.429 --> 03:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
example set up a a a program for low
 
03:37:39.070 --> 03:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
income okay well what do we mean by low
 
03:37:40.750 --> 03:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
income how should that look sort of
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
filling out all the details um that the
 
03:37:45.150 --> 03:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't need either should
 
03:37:45.160 --> 03:37:46.590 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't need either should
say

03:37:46.590 --> 03:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:37:48.670 --> 03:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
um that the legislature may not
 
03:37:50.110 --> 03:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to weigh into sort of
 
03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
the everyday day-to-day operations of a
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
state agency um so those are the rule
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
sets that go through um that go through
 
03:37:59.150 --> 03:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
the Jael carve process so our joint
 
03:38:01.150 --> 03:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on um on
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules um so it sort of
 
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
functions similar to the fiscal
 
03:38:06.510 --> 03:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
committee where they meet on a monthly
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
basis and each state agency um presents
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
the rules to the Jael car committee um
 
03:38:13.189 --> 03:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
they review them there's a whole process
 
03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
about how they reviewed public hearings
 
03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
things like that essentially to ensure
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
that as a state agency we're not making
 
03:38:20.910 --> 03:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
up rules that fall outside what the
 
03:38:22.670 --> 03:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
legislative directive
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
was so that is that is sort of rules in
 
03:38:26.670 --> 03:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
a nutshell I'm sure if there are any uh
 
03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
rules experts or those who folks have
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
served on jail car they may have a
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
better may take issue but that's sort of
 
03:38:34.590 --> 03:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
a broad brush stroke um orders are a
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
more spe uh specific instance of where
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has actually given the
 
03:38:42.590 --> 03:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
authority um to essentially
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
um um undertake a process c um that has
 
03:38:51.389 --> 03:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
legal backing so if um for example um
 
03:38:52.590 --> 03:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
this is usually where it comes into
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
contrast with rule so for example if you
 
03:38:56.189 --> 03:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
have a rule set right you can say okay
 
03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
we're making these decisions based on
 
03:39:00.990 --> 03:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
this rule set absent a rule set there's
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
no sort of backing as to why you've made
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
a decision to do a versus b x versus y
 
03:39:08.110 --> 03:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
um the order gives the ability to the
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
department to move forward and act on
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
those things and give it the legal
 
03:39:13.870 --> 03:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
authority to do so um again within the
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
confines of where the the legislature
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
has said yes you can issue orders based
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
on this so essentially as you're going
 
03:39:21.670 --> 03:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
through the process somebody who either
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
may not like it or wasn't chosen or
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
something like that can't say oh you
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
know what you didn't have the legal
 
03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
authority to do any of that so therefore
 
03:39:30.349 --> 03:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
I you can't choose anybody I didn't get
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
picked you have to you can't choose
 
03:39:33.469 --> 03:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
anybody so that's sort of it in a
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
nutshell but it's only used in The
 
03:39:36.030 --> 03:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
Limited circumstances where the
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has said yes by rule or by
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
order so order typically viewed as sort
 
03:39:43.710 --> 03:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
of an interim before the formal rules
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
get adopted
 
03:39:47.160 --> 03:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
get adopted
thank

03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
you so by adding this language by rule
 
03:39:54.110 --> 03:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
or by order it allows the department to
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
rule and then enforce it with an
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
order or in some cases just to use an
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
order based on authorization given
 
03:40:11.229 --> 03:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in statute to make to
 
03:40:14.189 --> 03:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
make something happen so that's that's
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's the essential
 
03:40:18.670 --> 03:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
the essence of of rule and
 
03:40:22.269 --> 03:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
order so if we go back to lines 2123 of
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
the original
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill we can add to that sentence and
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates project Readiness that
 
03:40:34.189 --> 03:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
seems like a reasonable addition any
 
03:40:38.349 --> 03:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
that still on line page one lines 21 to
 
03:40:44.239 --> 03:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
that still on line page one lines 21 to
23

03:40:45.990 --> 03:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
23
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
wait a minute yeah section three lines
 
03:40:49.830 --> 03:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
21 to
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
23 there's a sentence that begins if
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:59.830 --> 03:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
projects the suggestion is to
 
03:41:02.830 --> 03:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
add after the word credit at the end of
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
that sentence a comma followed by and
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates project
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.239 --> 03:41:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
period

03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
and just to be a picky Garian since it's
 
03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
about projects plural should be
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.269 --> 03:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
comma so uh Mr could you
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
explain why you thought that's a would
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
be a good uh addition certainly um first
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Corman for the
 
03:41:55.710 --> 03:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
grammatical correction I you know I read
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
through these a number of times and
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
there's still always stuff that I miss
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
so I always appreciate that um so yes
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question regarding uh
 
03:42:04.429 --> 03:42:04.439 align:start position:0%
the addition of that demonstrates
 
03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
project demonstrate project Readiness uh
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
this is this would only come into a
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
circumstance of where more than 6
 
03:42:15.309 --> 03:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
megawatts of projects apply in theory
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
you could have a project that comes in
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
um under this program um and based on
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
the current statute is just of the
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
greatest onu credit so a project could
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
come in and say you know what we're
 
03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
going to offer 99% of our output um for
 
03:42:32.990 --> 03:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
our exports the monetary credits to go
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
to this um to go to this program for the
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh on build credits for the um LMI
 
03:42:41.550 --> 03:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
customers that sounds great in principle
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
right although if you're reading through
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
an application you could see okay well
 
03:42:46.510 --> 03:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have site control of where
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
they're proposing to build this or they
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
haven't done um you know there's no
 
03:42:53.670 --> 03:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
interconnection point nearby that makes
 
03:42:55.110 --> 03:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
sense for the size of the array that
 
03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
they're talking that they're proposing
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
or for example Myriad of other sort of
 
03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
issues like that that sort of tell the
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
reviewer I don't know if this project is
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
quite ready yet in the event that
 
03:43:09.149 --> 03:43:09.159 align:start position:0%
there's more than six megawatts who
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
apply you could have some project that's
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
at the other lower end um you know I'm
 
03:43:15.149 --> 03:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
going to make up a number say 30%
 
03:43:16.990 --> 03:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
offering but they've already done you
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
know they've demonstrated site control
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
they have a clear financing plan they
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
have all these things that sort of show
 
03:43:24.429 --> 03:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
yeah this project if is going to be is
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
will get off the ground this project
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
will happen you know assuming all all
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
else being equal versus sort of this
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
aspirational project um which doesn't
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
sort of pass the sniff test and then you
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
have a which would end up knocking out
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
that project that would actually get
 
03:43:42.429 --> 03:43:42.439 align:start position:0%
done so if we were to just go purely
 
03:43:46.389 --> 03:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
based on the largest on built credit
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
someone I don't know why they would do
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
this but someone in theory could file an
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
application with a very high number on
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
it just designed to occupy that queue
 
03:43:56.830 --> 03:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
without actually having any intention of
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
doing the Project based on the way the
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
current statute is written our only
 
03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
jurist our only um ability to weed out
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
those program or to to to make those
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
designations is based on the largest on
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
Bill credit so by adding and
 
03:44:12.429 --> 03:44:12.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrates project Readiness we could
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
say okay this application for this
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
project they're clearly not ready yet
 
03:44:18.389 --> 03:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
and by taking space in the queue they
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
are essentially ensuring that another
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
project that may have a lower on Bill
 
03:44:24.750 --> 03:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
credit but is viable and actually is
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
ready to go would then not get included
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
so even though on paper oh well this is
 
03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
a much better project because it's going
 
03:44:31.790 --> 03:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
to offer all these other resources it's
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
not a real number versus the project
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
that gets kicked out even though it's
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually would have
 
03:44:39.670 --> 03:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
happened okay I think that's a good good
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
addition representative muns thank you
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Elliott so this so we so we
 
03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
get in this bill we get it again at the
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
whole issue of low to moderate income
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the definition of those those
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
groups um so I'm curious as to what the
 
03:44:59.950 --> 03:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
definition is we're using for this for
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and these programs but before
 
03:45:05.309 --> 03:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
you answer that I I I have another
 
03:45:08.710 --> 03:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
question I notic that we change the
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
language from low to moderate income
 
03:45:14.710 --> 03:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners to low to moderate income
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
house households which in my
 
03:45:17.880 --> 03:45:18.950 align:start position:0%
house households which in my
mind

03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:45:18.960 --> 03:45:20.030 align:start position:0%
mind
[Music]

03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
in you know decrease looking throughout
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of that statute um the word
 
03:45:29.790 --> 03:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
household is used um repeatedly
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
throughout that section of Statute
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually you can see it on line SE page
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
one line 17 for the product for the
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of households um the use of the
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
word household versus homeowner in this
 
03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
sense um does not necessarily apply to
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay who income do you count versus
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
whose do you not count um it's to make
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
it clear that this program is available
 
03:45:51.870 --> 03:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
for renters so even though you are not a
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
homeowner right you still have a
 
03:45:54.990 --> 03:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
household so that would be the
 
03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
distinction there now this the the
 
03:45:58.830 --> 03:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
department has interpreted the statute
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
to be inclusive and by the references to
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
households that would mean including
 
03:46:05.149 --> 03:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
renters so this is just a cleanup to
 
03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
make sure the statute's consistent
 
03:46:09.510 --> 03:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
throughout followup go ahead but what
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
would the what is the definition what's
 
03:46:13.750 --> 03:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
the threshold and and then just getting
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
back to the uh the previous Bill
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't we use that same threshold sure
 
03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
I am flipping back to the previous bill
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
um because there is the exact definition
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
of what LMI is uh in a tangential way
 
03:46:28.560 --> 03:46:33.950 align:start position:0%
of what LMI is uh in a tangential way
sorry

03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:36.670 --> 03:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah so there's part of it is up to
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
80% of Ami um which is essentially any
 
03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
Resident of a um public housing
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
authority or section housing or
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
something like that um trying to recall
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I can get back to
 
03:46:52.189 --> 03:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
you on this I believe the threshold is
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
300% of federal poverty um but that is
 
03:46:57.389 --> 03:46:57.399 align:start position:0%
done based on the household so for the
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
for 30 for the 303 Bill discussed
 
03:47:01.870 --> 03:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
earlier um this program looks at the
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
individual households rather than the
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
community as a large as at a whole
 
03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:09.710 align:start position:0%
community as a large as at a whole
excuse

03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.870 --> 03:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
me okay the other amendments suggested
 
03:47:16.269 --> 03:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
by the Department have absolutely
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this solar incentive
 
03:47:23.229 --> 03:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
program they are changes to a different
 
03:47:27.469 --> 03:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
part of RSA 362 F that apply to useful
 
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
thermal energy and they just add the
 
03:47:34.349 --> 03:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
words by rule or order to two different
 
03:47:37.710 --> 03:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
paragraphs now both of these useful
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
thermal energy
 
03:47:39.319 --> 03:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
thermal energy
paragraphs

03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
are paragraphs that were added by
 
03:47:44.040 --> 03:47:45.349 align:start position:0%
are paragraphs that were added by
Statute

03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
Statute
 
03:47:48.349 --> 03:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
last session or last
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
year that
 
03:47:54.910 --> 03:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
split the definition of useful thermal
 
03:47:57.870 --> 03:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
energy into two categories large and
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
small and exempt the small category from
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh certain metering requirements in
 
03:48:09.389 --> 03:48:09.399 align:start position:0%
order to prove that it qualifies for rex
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
that was language that everybody
 
03:48:17.149 --> 03:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
endorsed last year but by some for some
 
03:48:19.469 --> 03:48:19.479 align:start position:0%
reason we left out the the language of
 
03:48:22.990 --> 03:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
by rule or order which gives the the
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
department the ability to actually make
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
rules and enforce them so I think this
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable addition I'd be in favor
 
03:48:36.269 --> 03:48:36.279 align:start position:0%
of it any comment or questions for Mr
 
03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
Elliott representative Ms so that that
 
03:48:42.269 --> 03:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
would be something new to the bill right
 
03:48:43.710 --> 03:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
I mean there's nothing in the bill right
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
now that addresses that
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
correct this is a different section of
 
03:48:51.550 --> 03:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
law the uh the thermal energy correct
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you it is Germaine
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
though because it addresses the same
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
statute if it addressed a different
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
statute it would not be Germain but IT
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
addresses RSA 362 F so it it is
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
Germaine representative Bernardi so I'm
 
03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
in favor of going forward with all the
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
Amendments that Doe has proposed
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
here okay further comment representative
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh this is about the bill in
 
03:49:20.550 --> 03:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
general not specifically this
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
conversation so is that's okay
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay um starting on line 25
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
on page two all of those rep repeals we
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
heard that they were repealed because
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
the personal wireless service is no
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
longer within the purview of the
 
03:49:41.229 --> 03:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
department um does anybody own that now
 
03:49:43.630 --> 03:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
or is that just
 
03:49:43.640 --> 03:49:45.550 align:start position:0%
or is that just
dead

03:49:45.550 --> 03:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
dead
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
yeah guess oh have any insight on that J
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
Josh sure thank you for the question
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative um so when those statutes
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
were originally drafted uh and passed
 
03:49:57.630 --> 03:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
into law was I
 
03:50:00.269 --> 03:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
believe 2010
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
2012 um where there wasn't a lot of um
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
sort of uh guidelines and parameters for
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh how local zoning should really take a
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
look at uh where the sighting of of
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
these essentially person wireless
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
devices essentially um cell phone towers
 
03:50:19.990 --> 03:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
um since then it's been about 15 years
 
03:50:23.309 --> 03:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
and there's pretty robust um uh
 
03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have been adopted um
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for these
 
03:50:29.870 --> 03:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
communities um so the really the the or
 
03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
original charge was to sort of develop
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
these as part of um the office of energy
 
03:50:36.149 --> 03:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
and planning as it was um back in that
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
that time frame to develop these model
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
orces to allow for local communities
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
essentially to start from rather than
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
starting from scratch they have a base
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
to start from and go from there so the
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
need for these um has um has sort of the
 
03:50:50.510 --> 03:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
statutes have sort of outlived their
 
03:50:53.389 --> 03:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
usefulness in which the the the need for
 
03:50:57.429 --> 03:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
those things are no longer true
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
um okay okay so the repeal is just to
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of statutes that are no longer
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
useful that is correct my understanding
 
03:51:07.870 --> 03:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
was it was sort of a one time of here
 
03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
please go out and develop these model
 
03:51:11.630 --> 03:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
ordinances these model things for the
 
03:51:13.710 --> 03:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
communities to adopt um it was sort of a
 
03:51:16.189 --> 03:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
one-time here please go do this it's
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
sort of uh irrelevant statute
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
now okay good representative Ms did you
 
03:51:26.349 --> 03:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
have another question no
 
03:51:28.349 --> 03:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
others representative
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
parshall yes uh thank you Mr Al for your
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
further testimony uh section four
 
03:51:37.990 --> 03:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
received a little bit of scrutiny over
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the Senate can you uh paraphrase what
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
their concern was I see the amendment
 
03:51:44.910 --> 03:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
did not change anything too much with
 
03:51:47.229 --> 03:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
the original Bill thank you for the
 
03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
question yes there was a um proposal the
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
original section 4 which is not in the
 
03:51:54.269 --> 03:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
bill before you um actually sorry if I'm
 
03:51:55.950 --> 03:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
flipping back to the as introduced
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
version um would have had uh the
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
department taking on some um rulemaking
 
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
regarding uh energy storage systems
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
including tariffs and there was uh
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
concern that um by stakeholders that
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
they thought this was a process better
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
left to the Public Utilities Commission
 
03:52:16.830 --> 03:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
um which is why the department requested
 
03:52:23.469 --> 03:52:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:26.070 --> 03:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
phase okay representative
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you um I'm just looking at
 
03:52:31.229 --> 03:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
my notes uh from the hearing and on line
 
03:52:34.950 --> 03:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
23 on page one I'd written down
 
03:52:37.870 --> 03:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrated on Project Readiness is
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
that something that we had decided to
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
include yes okay we talked about that a
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:54.389 --> 03:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
else all right I think we're done with
 
03:52:54.399 --> 03:52:55.070 align:start position:0%
else all right I think we're done with
this

03:52:55.070 --> 03:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill let's talk now
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
391 now we had an extensive public
 
03:53:10.550 --> 03:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
hearing about this bill that lasted for
 
03:53:13.149 --> 03:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
2 hours and 20
 
03:53:15.189 --> 03:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
minutes oops
 
03:53:20.990 --> 03:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.790 --> 03:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure all of us took a lot of
 
03:53:27.149 --> 03:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
notes on this
 
03:53:27.159 --> 03:53:28.710 align:start position:0%
notes on this
bill

03:53:28.710 --> 03:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
been uh made aware of a potential
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that clean energy New
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has sent around so I'd like to
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
ask Mr Evans Brown if he could come up
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
and let us know what the status of that
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
potential amendment is I actually have
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
some copies here which I could pan pass
 
03:53:52.429 --> 03:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
out to the committee but I'm reluctant
 
03:53:56.349 --> 03:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
to do so unless I know that it is uh an
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that might have some momentum
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
let's say yes uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
Sam Evans Brown executive director of
 
03:54:06.670 --> 03:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire uh thank you
 
03:54:08.189 --> 03:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
for the question um we were actually
 
03:54:10.149 --> 03:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
just conferring prior to the hearing
 
03:54:12.070 --> 03:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
getting underway and I think the
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
proposal is that we'd like to get the
 
03:54:16.469 --> 03:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
parties to together to discuss how to
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
find a uh Common Ground um later this
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
week and so there are the department
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
does have con some concerns with the
 
03:54:26.950 --> 03:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
amendment we have some concerns with the
 
03:54:29.469 --> 03:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
bill as drafted um one thing I would
 
03:54:31.229 --> 03:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
just like to flag and I was just looking
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the establishing statute for the
 
03:54:35.070 --> 03:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um as I was sitting
 
03:54:38.149 --> 03:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the the back there that I don't it it
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
feels there are certain roles for the
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and the Public
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that we have really
 
03:54:46.990 --> 03:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
thought through as to what the duty of
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
each entity is in in my mind when you
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
read the statute establishing the
 
03:54:53.830 --> 03:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
department it really is to administer
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
programs create policy um and and it's
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
not the regulator of the utilities but
 
03:55:04.590 --> 03:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
it is true that in RSA 362
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
A9 uh comma x uh comma 10 through 12 the
 
03:55:11.149 --> 03:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
department is tasked with creating
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
interconnection rules and I would argue
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
that that is perhaps not the right
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
entity to to engage in that very similar
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
to how that we felt the department was
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
not the correct entity to create uh
 
03:55:24.750 --> 03:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
storage rules that that really is a an a
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
an act of regulation of the state's
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities as opposed to a
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
creation of policy or administration of
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
a program um so I would suggest we we
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
have suggested that we thought again
 
03:55:38.110 --> 03:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
that the the the puc is the better
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
entity to to carry out the rulem um if
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
the department of energy wants to write
 
03:55:45.670 --> 03:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
the draft rules that are considered as
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
the basis by which the the proceeding
 
03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
gets underway that's something that we
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
think is perfectly reasonable um and
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
would' be happy to to have it proceed as
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
such uh there and I think much of the
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
debate really revolves around uh the the
 
03:56:00.630 --> 03:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
creation of timelines and how that can
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
be done in such a way that it doesn't
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
fundamentally conflict with how JL car
 
03:56:06.269 --> 03:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
operates um so that we wouldn't get
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves crosswise with the statutes
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
for for the joint legislative committee
 
03:56:12.670 --> 03:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
on administrative
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
rules so thank you for that I still
 
03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
didn't get an answer to the question is
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
this suitable for handing out to the
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee or not I would not um I think
 
03:56:23.790 --> 03:56:23.800 align:start position:0%
I think you know if folks are curious to
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
see it certainly there's no secret uh
 
03:56:28.510 --> 03:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
there uh but I Mr Elliot could come up
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
and speak to his concerns about the
 
03:56:33.070 --> 03:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and I think we'd be better off
 
03:56:36.189 --> 03:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh sitting down the the all the folks
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
that are concerned with this with this
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill later in the week and seeing if we
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
can find consensus language okay so uh
 
03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:46.110 align:start position:0%
can find consensus language okay so uh
representative

03:56:46.110 --> 03:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
bernardy so uh thank you Mr chair um Mr
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown the bill that we have in for
 
03:56:59.950 --> 03:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
before us is to have the doe draft Draft
 
03:57:02.830 --> 03:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
rules and then those go anomally to the
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
Pu for rulemaking proceedings so I don't
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to do here
 
03:57:13.750 --> 03:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
that would be different than that or
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
improve prove the timing and why jel car
 
03:57:20.550 --> 03:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
is involved at all if the rules never
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
become rules until the Pu does its
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
job certainly so so I think perhaps it
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
might be best to have Mr Elliot talk
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
about his concerns with how what we
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
drafted interacted with JL car um what I
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
would say is I think that the the
 
03:57:38.269 --> 03:57:38.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that you all have before you
 
03:57:40.189 --> 03:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
is actually quite unclear as to what it
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
requires in I I I see the language as as
 
03:57:46.349 --> 03:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
not defin L requiring a rule making it's
 
03:57:48.550 --> 03:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
it and I I apologize I don't have it
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but but my my
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
memory of the the wording is essentially
 
03:57:55.710 --> 03:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
that they shall consider rules or you
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
know so so if if you'd like I can pull
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
it up and I can speak in a slightly more
 
03:58:03.910 --> 03:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
informed way um but but the the our Our
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
concern is that the language does not
 
03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
explicitly require Ru making and and
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
that is what we're attempting to to make
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
sure it's laid
 
03:58:14.990 --> 03:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
out so he has a followup but I'm just
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to point out that I did pass out
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
that suggested Amendment language just
 
03:58:22.349 --> 03:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
so people would know what we're talking
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
about just for transparency it's not
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
something we're going to consider but um
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
when you get the handout it's the
 
03:58:30.479 --> 03:58:31.790 align:start position:0%
when you get the handout it's the
section

03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:58:35.550 --> 03:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
two Public Utilities Commission that's
 
03:58:37.630 --> 03:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
the new section that um we're kind of
 
03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
talking about right here so okay go
 
03:58:41.950 --> 03:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and finish representative
 
03:58:44.670 --> 03:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair so to me
 
03:58:47.710 --> 03:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
it's very clear pu the doe is to do
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
Draft rules and it specifically says
 
03:58:53.710 --> 03:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
draft rule shall do da da D all these
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
various things and then it goes the
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
draft fuels will be utilized by the puc
 
03:59:03.990 --> 03:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
so the two hours of testimony that we
 
03:59:09.870 --> 03:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
heard last week was we need rules now if
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
I can summarize and so the real issue is
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
what process expedites this process what
 
03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know to make it
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
happen uh yes so so and and I am gon to
 
03:59:24.389 --> 03:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
try to pull up the language here so that
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
so I can say exactly what our concern is
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
moment yeah so so uh the department of
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
energy shall open a proceeding to
 
03:59:39.510 --> 03:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
examine and assess Draft rules and and I
 
03:59:41.309 --> 03:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
think our concern is with that language
 
03:59:43.990 --> 03:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
there specifically so a open a proced
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding to examine and assess what
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
does that mean does that mean they're
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to have a Ru making or they're
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to consider doing a rule making
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
and so uh in so far as as that's the
 
03:59:56.110 --> 03:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
Department's intent is to is to have a
 
03:59:59.229 --> 03:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
rul making then you know great let's go
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
um but but again I think uh we we do
 
04:00:04.870 --> 04:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a fundamental policy concern here
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
which is what is the entity that
 
04:00:08.550 --> 04:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
regulates the public utility the the
 
04:00:11.590 --> 04:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
state's electric utilities and I I I
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
think you know it's it's one that's
 
04:00:13.560 --> 04:00:14.510 align:start position:0%
think you know it's it's one that's
worth

04:00:14.510 --> 04:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
worth
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
thinking through um that you know we
 
04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
after the department of energy was
 
04:00:20.149 --> 04:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
established the year that followed there
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
was a cleanup bill that did a lot of
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
sort of find and replace of commission
 
04:00:25.269 --> 04:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
and department and I was actually just
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute and there's still
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
typos that are sort of littered
 
04:00:29.469 --> 04:00:29.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the statute you know the and
 
04:00:32.309 --> 04:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
and so so have we truly thought through
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
this particular aspect is I think the
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
question that we should be asking
 
04:00:39.070 --> 04:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves so we basically have a lot of
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
work to do then on this bill right yeah
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
so let's uh let's let you off the hook
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the moment and or no you want to ask
 
04:00:50.149 --> 04:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
a question okay representative mcke
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
wants to ask you a question yeah I just
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify my understanding is
 
04:00:57.510 --> 04:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
that um that the interconnection work
 
04:00:59.790 --> 04:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
which started with
 
04:01:03.630 --> 04:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
sp262 resulted in already a review of
 
04:01:06.030 --> 04:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
the rules that are available I I mean I
 
04:01:08.189 --> 04:01:08.199 align:start position:0%
think the report that we received in
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
December of last
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
year I would have thought would have
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
been where the draft of what we would be
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
considering would be considered because
 
04:01:20.110 --> 04:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
it ended up there was a stakeholder
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
process and there was also uh a review
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
of existing connection models and so the
 
04:01:28.910 --> 04:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
department of energy had done that work
 
04:01:30.750 --> 04:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
and then the report kind of came back as
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
a sort of a uh it just
 
04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
memorialized the information that it had
 
04:01:40.670 --> 04:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
it had received and it regurgitated it
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
in that report but without any sort of
 
04:01:46.110 --> 04:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
form or recommendation for what they
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
thought might be best out of that so
 
04:01:49.990 --> 04:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's almost like we're undertaking the
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
same process again if we go back to ask
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
the doe to do a draft it I'm just asking
 
04:01:58.229 --> 04:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
if if I'm looking at that correctly but
 
04:01:59.590 --> 04:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
it seems like we spent quite a bit of
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
time doing an assessment and talking to
 
04:02:04.030 --> 04:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders already yeah and I
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
would say that it was uh when Senate
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 262 was passed uh the the spike in
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
the quanti of interconnection requests
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
was just beginning and it hadn't really
 
04:02:19.269 --> 04:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
reached the pitch that it reached I
 
04:02:21.309 --> 04:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
think uh late last year and now
 
04:02:25.229 --> 04:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
continues going forward and um so when
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
the investigation then kicked off our
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
strong recommendation from from you know
 
04:02:33.630 --> 04:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
our organization as well as as many of
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders that we that we engage
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
with was that a Ru making should
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
commence and we were quite hopeful that
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
the study would recommend that as as an
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
as a policy outcome that should should
 
04:02:46.590 --> 04:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
be engaged upon and and we were hopeful
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
that they would actually recommend this
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation um the fact that it
 
04:02:53.309 --> 04:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
didn't do so is why Senate Bill 391 is
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
in front of you in the form that it is
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
is that the investigation did not
 
04:02:59.070 --> 04:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly say what we need are rules
 
04:03:01.870 --> 04:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
that do X Y and
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Z follow up could that have
 
04:03:07.229 --> 04:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
investigation could that investigation
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
have asked the Pu to go into Ru making
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
from there I'm we thought we thought we
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
were hopeful that would be case yeah
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
that would have been
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
good representative parshall you had a
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
question or I do one perhaps uh knowing
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
that uh Joshua OT may not be returning
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
ask this of you thank you for being here
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
um now do you think that I gather
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
there'll be some discussions outside of
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
this committee room uh and do you have
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
much confidence of the timeline with
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
specific dates and um Authority can be
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
established and we can hope for further
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the doe who
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
originally asked for this bill further
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations to further hone this uh
 
04:03:53.149 --> 04:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
un Amendment would further make these
 
04:03:54.670 --> 04:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
concerns of yours clear which are my
 
04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerns as well can we expect that uh I
 
04:04:00.510 --> 04:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
I am very confident that we can we can
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
get to yes on this bill I don't see any
 
04:04:04.269 --> 04:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
reason I I think the concerns about the
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
timeline and and whether or not the way
 
04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
that they're crafted in the amendment
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we put forward is you know in
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
conflict with how rule makings uh
 
04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
proceed are are totally uh something
 
04:04:18.429 --> 04:04:18.439 align:start position:0%
that we can we can figure out uh it's
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
just a question of of where how do we
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
lay out essentially a procedural
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
schedule between now and and when rules
 
04:04:30.269 --> 04:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
are are uh set to be approved by the Pu
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
and put in front of jail car and and it
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
really just takes someone who who you
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
know can walk that calendar back and
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
then say okay here's what we're going to
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
lay out in um in what what needs to be
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
laid out in statute and what doesn't
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
what can we simply come to agreement
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
that here's how we're going to do it
 
04:04:46.710 --> 04:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your efforts on this
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
area and I have no further questions
 
04:04:51.389 --> 04:04:51.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mutts thank you
 
04:04:51.399 --> 04:04:52.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mutts thank you
Mr

Mr
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
chair at the risk of opening the
 
04:04:56.910 --> 04:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box that I think we were
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid um would it be
 
04:05:02.149 --> 04:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate to ask the doe what their
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerns with the language in this
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is if you're asking
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.349 --> 04:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
please should I step away yeah I I I
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'll leave leave that to the chair
 
04:05:16.510 --> 04:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
discretion Mr ellot do do you feel
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable addressing that now or would
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
or okay are there any other questions
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
for Mr Evans
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
Brown okay seeing none thank you Sam and
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
now Mr Elliot will come back up and
 
04:05:38.149 --> 04:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
maybe give us a a preview
 
04:05:40.710 --> 04:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
of when I when I said the legislation I
 
04:05:43.229 --> 04:05:43.239 align:start position:0%
meant the amendment yes in preview of
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
what uh um May transpire with the
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
amendment uh good afternoon again Josh
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
Elliot director of the division of
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
policy and programs for the doe um I
 
04:05:54.750 --> 04:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
want to preface my comments with saying
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
that uh the department wants to get to
 
04:05:58.670 --> 04:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
yes department wants to get to yes on
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
this bill um walking back sort of
 
04:06:04.950 --> 04:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
through the process of how we got here
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 262 had us go through the
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
the the process getting stakeholder
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
input um and there wasn't there were
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
some areas of agreement but there were
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
some major areas of disagreement um and
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
that is sort of the underpinning piece
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
of this Ru making process right it's
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
this sort of Byzantine process that
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
unless you're member of Jael car or your
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
state agency actually involved in this
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
is sort of this opaque okay how exactly
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
do all does all this work um taking a
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
step back of the question of who should
 
04:06:34.349 --> 04:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
be doing this R making um if you look at
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
the 900 rules itself and as I as we had
 
04:06:40.030 --> 04:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation earlier the rules are
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
are directed by Statute and they have to
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
tie to statute and the rules are done
 
04:06:45.670 --> 04:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
based on those statutory right they're
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
not they don't come out of thin air they
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
come out of come out of what the statute
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
authority authority is if you look at
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
the current 900 rules they're all tied
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
to RSA 362a which is the net metering
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
statute which is what the department has
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
oversight of as part of the organization
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the department if there's a policy
 
04:07:04.830 --> 04:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
decision that the department should not
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
have oversight over net metering and
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
that less what the Tariff should be
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
which is part of the pe's public
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
utilities commission's
 
04:07:15.070 --> 04:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
process then that statute then that
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
needs to change right every single
 
04:07:19.389 --> 04:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
reference to Department in RSA 362a
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be swapped back to the
 
04:07:22.349 --> 04:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
commission because that is the only that
 
04:07:23.710 --> 04:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
would be the only thing that would make
 
04:07:26.269 --> 04:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
sense for the rul making just as for
 
04:07:28.269 --> 04:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
example the department of energy would
 
04:07:30.070 --> 04:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
not be responsible for the rule making
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
for department environmental services it
 
04:07:33.389 --> 04:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
does not make sense to have the Public
 
04:07:33.399 --> 04:07:34.990 align:start position:0%
does not make sense to have the Public
Utilities

04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
Commission overseeing and implementing
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
the rule process for a different state
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
agency there can be questions debate
 
04:07:43.710 --> 04:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the department
 
04:07:45.070 --> 04:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
should have the oversight over that
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
statute but that is the statute as it
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
currently exists um having conversations
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
with the Pu um they have no interest or
 
04:07:53.550 --> 04:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
the bandwidth to take this on um if they
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
were given funding and additional staff
 
04:07:58.429 --> 04:07:58.439 align:start position:0%
maybe that answer would change but um as
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
part of my direction in the bill is
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
introduced um the Public Utilities
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
Commission asked me um to convey to the
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee that they did not have the
 
04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
bandwith nor the interest of underdoing
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
this process um which is in my Senate
 
04:08:15.630 --> 04:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
testimony on the bill so that being said
 
04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense that the department has that
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority right we have the
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the statutes therefore
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
we develop and implement the
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
rules typically most rules are not
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
controversial right the the decisions
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
have already been made there are no
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
points of contention in this one
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
depending on who you talk to but based
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
on the fact that the are the uh Senate
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 262 process did not come out with a
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation at the end saying yep
 
04:08:40.109 --> 04:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
here it is here's the model you want to
 
04:08:41.469 --> 04:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
go on we have a couple of changes
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
everyone's all in agreement right that's
 
04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
not what the outcome was which is why
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
the department proposed doing working
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
groups on these particular issues um in
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
particular uh on on these questions of
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
interconnection and sort of these okay
 
04:08:55.149 --> 04:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
well which models you use again I've
 
04:08:56.429 --> 04:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
I've made reference to there were six
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
different proposals that were done uh
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
that were put forward for consideration
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
as part of that
 
04:09:05.109 --> 04:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
process that being said when you get to
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
the rul making process the idea is that
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
you are presenting a clean set of rules
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
to jel car and that they examine them
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
based on okay does this actually tie to
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
statute the statutory authorities there
 
04:09:17.429 --> 04:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a variety of things that
 
04:09:18.670 --> 04:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
they look through as they're going
 
04:09:20.429 --> 04:09:20.439 align:start position:0%
through and vetting rules and there's a
 
04:09:21.790 --> 04:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing process there's a whole
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole process that goes along
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
with it for stakeholder input and and
 
04:09:25.960 --> 04:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
with it for stakeholder input and and
other

04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
considerations including legal review
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
and that the the Jael cart staff issue a
 
04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation there's various steps
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
that it can go through either approved
 
04:09:37.389 --> 04:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
or or require just kick back to the
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
agency the idea is that you have a clean
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
set of rules that everyone's in
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
agreement on the concern of the
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
department is that there's not agreement
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
on all these things right you could put
 
04:09:49.309 --> 04:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
in a a timeline and we would be required
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
by Statute to go to Jael car and say
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
here you go here's the set of rules uh
 
04:09:55.630 --> 04:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
not everybody agrees on this there are
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
different parties and you know we had a
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
deadline set by the legislature so here
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
you go um that then that process could
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
then just go through could go through
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
the jail car process but there's sort of
 
04:10:09.750 --> 04:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
this assumption that the doe in this
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
process has the final say and can force
 
04:10:13.590 --> 04:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
compromise we can't we can come up with
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
the Draft rules we don't have that
 
04:10:16.990 --> 04:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
hammer we don't have that okay knock
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
everyone's heads together and get
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
compromise on this we don't have the
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
authority because it is Jael car at the
 
04:10:24.109 --> 04:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
end of the day that has that Authority
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
so we could do our process we could do
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
everything we could be collaborative we
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
could get all the stakeholders together
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
we could go through this whole process
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
but a deadline doesn't do anything a
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
deadline would say Okay submit the rules
 
04:10:38.109 --> 04:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
if there's agreement then okay then
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're all set if there's not agreement
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
then the whole thing just moves over to
 
04:10:42.870 --> 04:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
Jael car and then the fight the fight
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
out of the draft rule process moves from
 
04:10:48.269 --> 04:10:48.279 align:start position:0%
not from the Department's process then
 
04:10:51.389 --> 04:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
moves to the jail car process and then
 
04:10:52.830 --> 04:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
you know if somebody didn't like for
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
example okay there was a disagreement on
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a issue with days
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
right okay we one group says okay we
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
should really have it 60 days the other
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
group says no it really should be 30
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
days in the department maybe a salic
 
04:11:07.149 --> 04:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
answer says okay we're going to pick 60
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
days WR smack dab in the middle either
 
04:11:11.229 --> 04:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
of the parties who didn't like that
 
04:11:12.910 --> 04:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
answer could then just go to J car and
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
start lobbying the members of jail car
 
04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
and saying vote down these rules the
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
reason I say this is because I don't
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
want this process set up to fail I don't
 
04:11:22.510 --> 04:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
want us to be in a situation of where we
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
go through the process we deliver them
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
to jail car and then the whole process
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
gets blown up because then it just gets
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
kicked right back to the apartment and
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
we start right back over again I do not
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
want to commit staff time energy and
 
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
resources to a process where I think has
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
a good chance of failing because I don't
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
think that serves anybody including
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
folks Mr Evans Brown uh Mr um ban Etc
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
who are working on this bill is we want
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
to get to yes our concern is we want to
 
04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
make sure it's implementable we don't
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
want to go down a road and spend all
 
04:11:50.830 --> 04:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
those time and effort and resources just
 
04:11:53.109 --> 04:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
to be right back where we are today
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing I understand in
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
most other circumstances right deadlines
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
make sense right it compels somebody for
 
04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
example here the legislature you have
 
04:12:03.630 --> 04:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
deadlines to get out FN bills and bills
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
going to Second committees right at some
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
point it forces that decision to be made
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
in this situation the department is not
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
the final Arbiter and that's why the
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
deadline doesn't make sense
 
04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
I get it from a conceptual standpoint
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I understand I heard the the
 
04:12:19.229 --> 04:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
testimony all of you heard um on this
 
04:12:21.149 --> 04:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
question um right there's a need and
 
04:12:22.830 --> 04:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a desire and there's
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
certainly issues here that need to be
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
addressed the department doesn't dispute
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
that or argue with that we want to make
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
sure that the process actually gets us
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
to where we need to
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
go sorry monologue the Department's
 
04:12:38.189 --> 04:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
investig investigatory proceeding then
 
04:12:41.309 --> 04:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
did recommend the set up setting up of
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
some uh working groups to resolve these
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
issues is that correct yes so as the
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
report that was issued recommended the
 
04:12:48.910 --> 04:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
setting up setting up of two different
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
working groups to work on two separate
 
04:12:52.229 --> 04:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
issues the sort of getting into the
 
04:12:54.109 --> 04:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
Weeds on these these rules was one of
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
those working
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
groups and has anybody made an attempt
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
to set up these working groups yet this
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
bill was then introduced which sort of
 
04:13:05.309 --> 04:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
circumvented that process so the
 
04:13:06.830 --> 04:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
department made the decision okay if the
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
legislature is going to step in here why
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
should the agency spend the time and the
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
effort on doing these things when then
 
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is pending before you so the
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
department wants the legislature to be
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
the working group basically no not
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily we were committed to work
 
04:13:22.630 --> 04:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
having those working groups set up and
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
then this sort of undercut those working
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
groups so then as a rational decision
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
say okay well if the legislature is
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to do this or take action on this
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
why should we spend all the time and
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
effort over here if the legislature is
 
04:13:34.990 --> 04:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
going to direct us to do something
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
anyway so maybe I should have said this
 
04:13:39.550 --> 04:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
is kind of falling in the legislature's
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
lap at this point all right
 
04:13:46.389 --> 04:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
I think I understand what the issue is
 
04:13:49.790 --> 04:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
here representative muns you have a
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
question um so if you know if if if the
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to try
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this these rules get
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
um uh programed you know as quickly as
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
possible um and you feel you don't have
 
04:14:12.590 --> 04:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
the authority to be the final Arbiter is
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
there something that you would you would
 
04:14:18.510 --> 04:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
want us to do to give you that
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
Authority so this is what I believe sort
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the the underpinnings of the Jael car
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
process is to make sure that there is
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
agreement on all these things so Jael
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
car that the rules have the full force
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
and effect of
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
Statute having controversial rules this
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
sort of system is designed in order to
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that those don't happen by
 
04:14:41.149 --> 04:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
having this open and transparent
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
process so in order to sort of Force
 
04:14:45.109 --> 04:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
everybody would require either clear
 
04:14:46.990 --> 04:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
legislative direction to say here
 
04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
spelling out every single Last Detail of
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
those rules of what they should include
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
and what those timelines are which I
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
don't think this committee or any
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
Committee of your colleagues and other
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
committees would want to be able to do
 
04:14:58.990 --> 04:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
um but I understand it's right it it is
 
04:15:00.590 --> 04:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
sort of one of those messy facets of
 
04:15:03.630 --> 04:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
democracy right to to be able to make
 
04:15:06.429 --> 04:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
sure you want to have all of that
 
04:15:09.429 --> 04:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
input but at this but it takes time
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
right it takes
 
04:15:11.960 --> 04:15:15.469 align:start position:0%
right it takes
time

04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.990 --> 04:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
followup yes go ahead yeah no I I I
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
think you know a transparent process is
 
04:15:22.990 --> 04:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
the ideal process and you want and I
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
agree with you you want to try to bring
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
people together and get consensus but um
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
at some point the process has to end and
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
and you know and how do how do we make
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
how do we do you do you feel like you
 
04:15:39.550 --> 04:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
have the authority
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
to to end that process at some point
 
04:15:45.389 --> 04:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
and or do you do we want you to have
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
that Authority I guess is the the bigger
 
04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
question right at some point the process
 
04:15:50.670 --> 04:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
would end right we would get through
 
04:15:53.149 --> 04:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
everything and it may be us and one of
 
04:15:55.109 --> 04:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
the parties or one of the groups um
 
04:15:56.910 --> 04:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
saying yes this is what we think and
 
04:15:58.030 --> 04:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
there may be one of the other parties
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
that says no that is absolutely terrible
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
then that goes to we could still submit
 
04:16:04.590 --> 04:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
those rules but we would want to make
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
sure okay if we tried every single last
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
effort can we get compromise here right
 
04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and I know folks
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
want to have this happen quickly in an
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
expedition ious way the department is
 
04:16:16.750 --> 04:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
ready willing and able to do that it's a
 
04:16:18.109 --> 04:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
matter of all the parties coming
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
together and agreeing on all of those
 
04:16:22.830 --> 04:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
facets so I know the parties want to
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
move quickly they're going to have to
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
all come together to to sort of say okay
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
where are your red lines where can you
 
04:16:29.710 --> 04:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate where are you okay with and I
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
think part of my um testimony earlier on
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
the bill was not um you know not what do
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
you approve but what can you live with
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
what are you okay with you may not like
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
it but what are you okay with and I
 
04:16:43.950 --> 04:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
think um
 
04:16:47.109 --> 04:16:47.119 align:start position:0%
as part of the rule process it it's I
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
wish I had some sort of way to cut this
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
gordian KN right of saying okay this all
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to come together
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
everyone has to answer these questions
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
and everyone's got to basically pick and
 
04:16:58.349 --> 04:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
then commit that no one is going to then
 
04:17:00.269 --> 04:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
go to jail car and Lobby members of jail
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
car if they don't like their way way
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
decided well one thing we have working
 
04:17:09.510 --> 04:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
in our favor here is today is March
 
04:17:11.790 --> 04:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
25th and I just looked in the house
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
calendar and the last day to act on
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
Senate bills is May
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
16th so we
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
have 45 50
 
04:17:27.149 --> 04:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
days to try to come to some kind of a
 
04:17:29.469 --> 04:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
resolution obviously to get it out of
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
this committee to the house floor by the
 
04:17:34.630 --> 04:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
16th we would have to be done by about a
 
04:17:37.950 --> 04:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
week before the 16th but um so the first
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
week of May but still that gives us 45
 
04:17:44.429 --> 04:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
days so it sounds to me like what we
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
need to do and we have done this many
 
04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
times before since I've been in the
 
04:17:50.349 --> 04:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
legislature I did it with Senator
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
Bradley on House Bill 1116 way back in
 
04:17:59.469 --> 04:17:59.479 align:start position:0%
2015 I did it on House Bill 315 in 2020
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
I did it with um House Bill
 
04:18:06.309 --> 04:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
549 convened working
 
04:18:06.319 --> 04:18:08.149 align:start position:0%
549 convened working
groups

04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
and hammered out the issues and got to
 
04:18:15.070 --> 04:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
an agreement and then that's what we put
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
into legislation so it sounds to me like
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to do again we have
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
to convene a working group I know clean
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
energy no Hampshire and ever Source
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
wants to be part of that working group
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and they will suggest any other
 
04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
stakehold holders that need to be part
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
of that working group pachy Campbell I'm
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
sure would like to be part of that part
 
04:18:39.229 --> 04:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
of that working group so we'll come up
 
04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
with a a working group and
 
04:18:44.830 --> 04:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
many of the working groups that I've
 
04:18:47.070 --> 04:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with in the past have
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
been uh Zoom meetings we've conduct
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
conducted them via
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
Zoom um the the working group we did
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
with Senator Bradley on houseu
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
1116 was a in was in person and we could
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
do that again as well so I I think we
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
can put together something that can try
 
04:19:12.910 --> 04:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
to resolve the issues so that then we
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
could create legislation that will
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
Implement what we want to to see done I
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
will just add I think U Mr Evans Brown
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
made this comment um myself Mr Evans
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
Brown Mr Monahan and Mr lato are all
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
meeting at uh on Thursday to discuss so
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
excellent I'll be interested to hear
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
what you what you come up with and if we
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
need to can go further and and a convene
 
04:19:39.309 --> 04:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
a working group that adds other people
 
04:19:42.030 --> 04:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
we can do that if you can work out all
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
the issues yourselves and get back to us
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
that would be great too but I'm I'm
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
willing to do a working group if we have
 
04:19:52.349 --> 04:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
to representative Corman thank you so I
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying about
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
gel car being I guess the last stop in
 
04:19:57.439 --> 04:19:58.349 align:start position:0%
gel car being I guess the last stop in
the

04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
process now these rules are going to be
 
04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
rather technical aren't
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
they yes excuse me thank you for the
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
question yes most of them are um in
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
terms of uh if you look at the existing
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
rules for smaller arrays yes most of
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
them do get fairly technical yeah so I'm
 
04:20:18.429 --> 04:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
just wondering is is gel car even
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
capable of evaluating such technical
 
04:20:24.109 --> 04:20:24.119 align:start position:0%
rules um they are um they've done
 
04:20:27.229 --> 04:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
similar in the past um for um both our
 
04:20:29.469 --> 04:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
agency um and for Myriad of other
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
agencies um that do very technical
 
04:20:36.109 --> 04:20:36.119 align:start position:0%
things cing Dees do Etc okay and the
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
speaker initiated a new process this
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
year he uh has created a
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh rules of review subcommittee within
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
each house committee so here in science
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
technology and energy
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
myself Vice chair Thomas representative
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
McGee and you representative Corman are
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
the four members of the subcommittee
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
that evaluates Jael car rules for
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy now you
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
may be wondering we haven't done that
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
well that's because so far there haven't
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
been any rules proposed that I thought
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
needed our review but we are a
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that will review Jael car
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
rules uh if we feel that it's necessary
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
to do so to make sure that they conform
 
04:21:23.349 --> 04:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
with statute thank you for telling me
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm on the
 
04:21:26.429 --> 04:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I thought I I thought that
 
04:21:29.630 --> 04:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
had already been conveyed to you
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
no uh representative
 
04:21:35.109 --> 04:21:35.119 align:start position:0%
bernardy in addition to that jel car
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
also sends out a notice of rules of
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
every uh committee Commission agency
 
04:21:45.790 --> 04:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
that they're reviewing on a periodic
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
basis and said you can look through them
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is to all the legislators you look
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
through them you can identify if there's
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
something you want to zero in on to see
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
if it complies with the statutes that
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
you are interested in and send your
 
04:22:02.030 --> 04:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
comments to jel car so we are all on the
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
hook is is that the ru making register
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
emails I get yes it is yes and
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
that's representative McGee thank you Mr
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
chairman so I I have a question that
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
goes back to uh I wrote down doe has
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
Authority under 362a which is a net
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
metering statute so you're looking for
 
04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority in order to make
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
sure that when you present what you're
 
04:22:25.950 --> 04:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
presenting to Jael car for consideration
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a statutory link so the
 
04:22:31.030 --> 04:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
question is if interconnections don't
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
always have to do with n metering so is
 
04:22:37.830 --> 04:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
that the right place or uh I mean I I
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
think you can link it there but but
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
interconnections are not always net
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
meters right so is it is that the right
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
place for it to be or do we have to
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
rethink that too so thank you for the
 
04:22:50.830 --> 04:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
question so all of the statutory
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
references that the the pc900 rules
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
which are the interconnection rules or
 
04:22:57.389 --> 04:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
the net metering rules excuse me um are
 
04:23:01.109 --> 04:23:01.119 align:start position:0%
all linked back to the to that statute
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
um that's where the statute statutory
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
Authority lies in order for us to
 
04:23:08.109 --> 04:23:08.119 align:start position:0%
develop those those variety of things
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with net metering including
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
inter interconnection is one of those um
 
04:23:14.990 --> 04:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
it would require statutory changes to
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
move it to a different agency or if it
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to be the Pu it would require
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
them taking over all of those statute as
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
well so you do the statute paired with
 
04:23:25.109 --> 04:23:25.119 align:start position:0%
the rule not not separate so 900 is the
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
rule I'm just trying to understand oh
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes so P so the current yes so
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry um the current um p900 rules
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
are where all of the net metering um
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
rule sets are and there's a variety of
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
different things including everything to
 
04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
down to you know how you do meters what
 
04:23:44.590 --> 04:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
meters qualify and things like that um
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
that all of that statutory def all of
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
those statutory um Authority all ties
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
back to the net metering statutes which
 
04:23:52.880 --> 04:23:54.030 align:start position:0%
back to the net metering statutes which
is

04:23:54.030 --> 04:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:23:57.750 --> 04:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
362a so you so in followup yes go ahead
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
so you would Envision interconnection
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
which is already listed
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
there uh under the 900 rules section you
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
would Envision it
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
being these findings would be um
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
listed there as well that that that's
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
where they would be tied back yes so
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
there is current in in in roles right
 
04:24:20.429 --> 04:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
now so we have set up for
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
interconnection for less than 100
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
kilowatts all all so it's already I'm
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry it's already in the 900 rules I
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
can't remember exactly which one I'm
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
sure someone will correct me um within
 
04:24:32.910 --> 04:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
the 900 rules there is a reference to
 
04:24:34.349 --> 04:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
larger interconnection project which is
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
the one we're talking about here which
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
says shall defer to the Tariff of each
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
of the utilities so right there is
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
technically a rule for larger
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
interconnection just says go over here
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
for this instead we're not putting it in
 
04:24:47.590 --> 04:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's not in in rule so this would
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
clearly give us the direction okay to
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
take rather than just saying defer to
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the Tariff actually spell out everything
 
04:24:55.750 --> 04:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
like we've done for small customer
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
generators okay thank you I don't know
 
04:25:01.229 --> 04:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
if you know the answer to this Josh
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I wondered about
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
with this Senate Bill 391 is it appears
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be drafted as session law rather than
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
and that seems to that would seem to be
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
a problem or not what do you what is
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
your judgment um I can't speak to the
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
question as to why it was session law
 
04:25:31.469 --> 04:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
versus put into the statute itself um I
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was a choice of the
 
04:25:35.710 --> 04:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor or a suggestion by um alls
 
04:25:38.349 --> 04:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't speak to that um I don't
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
think it presents an issue one way or
 
04:25:40.710 --> 04:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
the other you could either put it in
 
04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
statute or put it in session law I think
 
04:25:44.830 --> 04:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
it would be um I don't see a material
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
difference between doing it one way or
 
04:25:46.119 --> 04:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
difference between doing it one way or
the

04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:50.469 --> 04:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
other oh okay all
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
right any further um questions or
 
04:25:56.950 --> 04:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
Josh it's 2:30 so oh did somebody raise
 
04:26:03.109 --> 04:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
their hand all right I I just
 
04:26:04.510 --> 04:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ms I don't have a
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
question for Mr Elliott but I just had a
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
before we split I was just kind of
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
curious what okay Josh you're you're
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're excused it
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
were I I just was curious kind of where
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
we where we landed in terms of next
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
steps I mean I know there was talking
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
about convening subgroups Etc I was just
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to address that issue so I think
 
04:26:27.630 --> 04:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we'll wait until we
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
hear from how the meeting on Thursday
 
04:26:31.199 --> 04:26:32.750 align:start position:0%
hear from how the meeting on Thursday
goes

04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
goes
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
and if I hear from a couple of the
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
participants in Thursday's meeting that
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
a working group is necessary we will
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
form one
 
04:26:45.630 --> 04:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
and our working group will be comprised
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders and any legislators who
 
04:26:51.389 --> 04:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
are interested in participating any
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who are
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
04:26:56.469 --> 04:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
participating I've worked with working
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
groups in the past that had as many as
 
04:27:04.830 --> 04:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
15 18 people so um it takes a little
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
longer to get through a working group
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
with that many people but you you do get
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
something accomplished eventually if you
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
stick with it uh HB
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
315 was a great example of that that was
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the bill from 2020 that
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
um corrected issues with RSA 53e the
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
community power Community aggregation
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
legislation which was deadlocked in a
 
04:27:34.479 --> 04:27:35.790 align:start position:0%
legislation which was deadlocked in a
rules

04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:27:40.510 --> 04:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
impass and uh HB 315 resolved with a
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
work working group all the issues so
 
04:27:46.630 --> 04:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
that uh we could put forth legislation
 
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
that allowed the ru making to move
 
04:27:51.630 --> 04:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
forward and to everybody's satisfaction
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
so that would be the model we would use
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
for a a working group if we had to have
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
one for this bill so that will be our
 
04:28:03.030 --> 04:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
next step would be to create that and U
 
04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
so I will let you know at the end of
 
04:28:07.710 --> 04:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
this week or early next week whether we
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
need to form a working group or
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
not and that can bring us to the end of
 
04:28:16.510 --> 04:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
our activity for
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
today now next week is a huge question
 
04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
mark right at the
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
moment we only have at the moment the
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
five bills that we've already heard from
 
04:28:29.399 --> 04:28:30.790 align:start position:0%
five bills that we've already heard from
the

04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:32.990 --> 04:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
Senate we don't have any additional
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
bills coming our way that I know about
 
04:28:37.590 --> 04:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
there is a rumor that there are some
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
more coming our way but I don't know
 
04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
what whether that will actually happen
 
04:28:42.920 --> 04:28:43.950 align:start position:0%
what whether that will actually happen
or

04:28:43.950 --> 04:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
not and we have as as I said earlier
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
until May 16th or maybe the work week
 
04:28:52.710 --> 04:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
before to finish our work on these
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
Senate bills so we have plenty of time
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
so as a result I'm thinking that we may
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
not do anything next week we may take
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
the week off and uh not return to
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
committee work until the following week
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
which would be April the week of April
 
04:29:14.030 --> 04:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
the 8th we won't do anything on the 8th
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
because that's Eclipse day but we may
 
04:29:19.469 --> 04:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
meet on April
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%

eye on your email inbox and I'll let you
 
04:29:29.429 --> 04:29:29.439 align:start position:0%

391 we may do that prior to the 9th and
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
